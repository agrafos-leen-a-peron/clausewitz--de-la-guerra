<h3><a name=3D"pref01"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>
The Germans interpret their new national colours=E2=80=94black, red, and
white=E2=80=94by the saying, =E2=80=9CDurch Nacht und Blut zur licht.=E2=80=
=9D
(=E2=80=9CThrough night and blood to light=E2=80=9D), and no work yet writt=
en
conveys to the thinker a clearer conception of all that the red streak in t=
heir
flag stands for than this deep and philosophical analysis of =E2=80=9CWar=
=E2=80=9D
by Clausewitz.
</p>

<p>
It reveals =E2=80=9CWar,=E2=80=9D stripped of all accessories, as the exerc=
ise of
force for the attainment of a political object, unrestrained by any law sav=
e
that of expediency, and thus gives the key to the interpretation of German
political aims, past, present, and future, which is unconditionally necessa=
ry
for every student of the modern conditions of Europe. Step by step, every e=
vent
since Waterloo follows with logical consistency from the teachings of Napol=
eon,
formulated for the first time, some twenty years afterwards, by this remark=
able
thinker.
</p>

<p>
What Darwin accomplished for Biology generally Clausewitz did for the
Life-History of Nations nearly half a century before him, for both have pro=
ved
the existence of the same law in each case, viz., =E2=80=9CThe survival of =
the
fittest=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the =E2=80=9Cfittest,=E2=80=9D as Huxley long sinc=
e pointed
out, not being necessarily synonymous with the ethically =E2=80=9Cbest.=E2=
=80=9D
Neither of these thinkers was concerned with the ethics of the struggle whi=
ch
each studied so exhaustively, but to both men the phase or condition presen=
ted
itself neither as moral nor immoral, any more than are famine, disease, or
other natural phenomena, but as emanating from a force inherent in all livi=
ng
organisms which can only be mastered by understanding its nature. It is in =
that
spirit that, one after the other, all the Nations of the Continent, taught =
by
such drastic lessons as K=C3=B6niggr=C3=A4tz and Sedan, have accepted the l=
esson, with
the result that to-day Europe is an armed camp, and <i>peace is maintained =
by the
equilibrium of forces, and will continue just as long as this equilibrium
exists, and no longer.</i>
</p>

<p>
Whether this state of equilibrium is in itself a good or desirable thing ma=
y be
open to argument. I have discussed it at length in my =E2=80=9CWar and the
World=E2=80=99s Life=E2=80=9D; but I venture to suggest that to no one woul=
d a
renewal of the era of warfare be a change for the better, as far as existin=
g
humanity is concerned. Meanwhile, however, with every year that elapses the
forces at present in equilibrium are changing in magnitude=E2=80=94the pres=
sure
of populations which have to be fed is rising, and an explosion along the l=
ine
of least resistance is, sooner or later, inevitable.
</p>

<p>
As I read the teaching of the recent Hague Conference, no responsible
Government on the Continent is anxious to form in themselves that line of l=
east
resistance; <i>they</i> know only too well what War would mean; and we alon=
e,
absolutely unconscious of the trend of the dominant thought of Europe, are
pulling down the dam which may at any moment let in on us the flood of
invasion.
</p>

<p>
Now no responsible man in Europe, perhaps least of all in Germany, thanks u=
s
for this voluntary destruction of our defences, for all who are of any
importance would very much rather end their days in peace than incur the bu=
rden
of responsibility which War would entail. But they realise that the gradual
dissemination of the principles taught by Clausewitz has created a conditio=
n of
molecular tension in the minds of the Nations they govern analogous to the
=E2=80=9Ccritical temperature of water heated above boiling-point under
pressure,=E2=80=9D which may at any moment bring about an explosion which t=
hey
will be powerless to control.
</p>

<p>
The case is identical with that of an ordinary steam boiler, delivering so =
and
so many pounds of steam to its engines as long as the envelope can contain =
the
pressure; but let a breach in its continuity arise=E2=80=94relieving the bo=
iling
water of all restraint=E2=80=94and in a moment the whole mass flashes into
vapour, developing a power no work of man can oppose.
</p>

<p>
The ultimate consequences of defeat no man can foretell. The only way to av=
ert
them is to ensure victory; and, again following out the principles of
Clausewitz, victory can only be ensured by the creation in peace of an
organisation which will bring every available man, horse, and gun (or ship =
and
gun, if the war be on the sea) in the shortest possible time, and with the
utmost possible momentum, upon the decisive field of action=E2=80=94which i=
n turn
leads to the final doctrine formulated by Von der Goltz in excuse for the
action of the late President Kruger in 1899:
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CThe Statesman who, knowing his instrument to be ready, and seeing =
War
inevitable, hesitates to strike first is guilty of a crime against his
country.=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
It is because this sequence of cause and effect is absolutely unknown to ou=
r
Members of Parliament, elected by popular representation, that all our effo=
rts
to ensure a lasting peace by securing <i>efficiency with economy</i> in our=
 National
Defences have been rendered nugatory.
</p>

<p>
This estimate of the influence of Clausewitz=E2=80=99s sentiments on contem=
porary
thought in Continental Europe may appear exaggerated to those who have not
familiarised themselves with M. Gustav de Bon=E2=80=99s exposition of the l=
aws
governing the formation and conduct of crowds I do not wish for one minute =
to
be understood as asserting that Clausewitz has been conscientiously studied=
 and
understood in <i>any</i> Army, not even in the Prussian, but his work has b=
een the
ultimate foundation on which every drill regulation in Europe, except our o=
wn,
has been reared. It is this ceaseless repetition of his fundamental ideas t=
o
which one-half of the male population of every Continental Nation has been
subjected for two to three years of their lives, which has tuned their mind=
s to
vibrate in harmony with his precepts, and those who know and appreciate thi=
s
fact at its true value have only to strike the necessary chords in order to
evoke a response sufficient to overpower any other ethical conception which
those who have not organised their forces beforehand can appeal to.
</p>

<p>
The recent set-back experienced by the Socialists in Germany is an illustra=
tion
of my position. The Socialist leaders of that country are far behind the
responsible Governors in their knowledge of the management of crowds. The
latter had long before (in 1893, in fact) made their arrangements to preven=
t
the spread of Socialistic propaganda beyond certain useful limits. As long =
as
the Socialists only threatened capital they were not seriously interfered w=
ith,
for the Government knew quite well that the undisputed sway of the employer=
 was
not for the ultimate good of the State. The standard of comfort must not be
pitched too low if men are to be ready to die for their country. But the mo=
ment
the Socialists began to interfere seriously with the discipline of the Army=
 the
word went round, and the Socialists lost heavily at the polls.
</p>

<p>
If this power of predetermined reaction to acquired ideas can be evoked
successfully in a matter of internal interest only, in which the =E2=80=9Co=
bvious
interest=E2=80=9D of the vast majority of the population is so clearly on t=
he
side of the Socialist, it must be evident how enormously greater it will pr=
ove
when set in motion against an external enemy, where the =E2=80=9Cobvious
interest=E2=80=9D of the people is, from the very nature of things, as mani=
festly
on the side of the Government; and the Statesman who failed to take into
account the force of the =E2=80=9Cresultant thought wave=E2=80=9D of a crow=
d of
some seven million men, all trained to respond to their ruler=E2=80=99s cal=
l,
would be guilty of treachery as grave as one who failed to strike when he k=
new
the Army to be ready for immediate action.
</p>

<p>
As already pointed out, it is to the spread of Clausewitz=E2=80=99s ideas t=
hat
the present state of more or less immediate readiness for war of all Europe=
an
Armies is due, and since the organisation of these forces is uniform this
=E2=80=9Cmore or less=E2=80=9D of readiness exists in precise proportion to=
 the
sense of duty which animates the several Armies. Where the spirit of duty a=
nd
self-sacrifice is low the troops are unready and inefficient; where, as in
Prussia, these qualities, by the training of a whole century, have become
instinctive, troops really are ready to the last button, and might be poure=
d
down upon any one of her neighbours with such rapidity that the very first
collision must suffice to ensure ultimate success=E2=80=94a success by no m=
eans
certain if the enemy, whoever he may be, is allowed breathing-time in which=
 to
set his house in order.
</p>

<p>
An example will make this clearer. In 1887 Germany was on the very verge of=
 War
with France and Russia. At that moment her superior efficiency, the consequ=
ence
of this inborn sense of duty=E2=80=94surely one of the highest qualities of
humanity=E2=80=94was so great that it is more than probable that less than =
six
weeks would have sufficed to bring the French to their knees. Indeed, after=
 the
first fortnight it would have been possible to begin transferring troops fr=
om
the Rhine to the Niemen; and the same case may arise again. But if France a=
nd
Russia had been allowed even ten days=E2=80=99 warning the German plan woul=
d have
been completely defeated. France alone might then have claimed all the effo=
rts
that Germany could have put forth to defeat her.
</p>

<p>
Yet there are politicians in England so grossly ignorant of the German read=
ing
of the Napoleonic lessons that they expect that Nation to sacrifice the
enormous advantage they have prepared by a whole century of self-sacrifice =
and
practical patriotism by an appeal to a Court of Arbitration, and the furthe=
r
delays which must arise by going through the medieval formalities of recall=
ing
Ambassadors and exchanging ultimatums.
</p>

<p>
Most of our present-day politicians have made their money in business=E2=80=
=94a
=E2=80=9Cform of human competition greatly resembling War,=E2=80=9D to para=
phrase
Clausewitz. Did they, when in the throes of such competition, send formal
notice to their rivals of their plans to get the better of them in commerce=
?
Did Mr. Carnegie, the arch-priest of Peace at any price, when he built up t=
he
Steel Trust, notify his competitors when and how he proposed to strike the
blows which successively made him master of millions? Surely the Directors =
of a
Great Nation may consider the interests of their shareholders=E2=80=94i.e.,=
 the
people they govern=E2=80=94as sufficiently serious not to be endangered by =
the
deliberate sacrifice of the preponderant position of readiness which
generations of self-devotion, patriotism and wise forethought have won for
them?
</p>

<p>
As regards the strictly military side of this work, though the recent
researches of the French General Staff into the records and documents of th=
e
Napoleonic period have shown conclusively that Clausewitz had never grasped=
 the
essential point of the Great Emperor=E2=80=99s strategic method, yet it is
admitted that he has completely fathomed the spirit which gave life to the
form; and notwithstanding the variations in application which have resulted
from the progress of invention in every field of national activity (not in =
the
technical improvements in armament alone), this spirit still remains the
essential factor in the whole matter. Indeed, if anything, modern appliance=
s
have intensified its importance, for though, with equal armaments on both
sides, the form of battles must always remain the same, the facility and
certainty of combination which better methods of communicating orders and
intelligence have conferred upon the Commanders has rendered the control of
great masses immeasurably more certain than it was in the past.
</p>

<p>
Men kill each other at greater distances, it is true=E2=80=94but killing is=
 a
constant factor in all battles. The difference between =E2=80=9Cnow and
then=E2=80=9D lies in this, that, thanks to the enormous increase in range =
(the
essential feature in modern armaments), it is possible to concentrate by
surprise, on any chosen spot, a man-killing power fully twentyfold greater =
than
was conceivable in the days of Waterloo; and whereas in Napoleon=E2=80=99s =
time
this concentration of man-killing power (which in his hands took the form o=
f
the great case-shot attack) depended almost entirely on the shape and condi=
tion
of the ground, which might or might not be favourable, nowadays such
concentration of fire-power is almost independent of the country altogether=
.
</p>

<p>
Thus, at Waterloo, Napoleon was compelled to wait till the ground became fi=
rm
enough for his guns to gallop over; nowadays every gun at his disposal, and
five times that number had he possessed them, might have opened on any poin=
t in
the British position he had selected, as soon as it became light enough to =
see.
</p>

<p>
Or, to take a more modern instance, viz., the battle of St. Privat-Gravelot=
te,
August 18, 1870, where the Germans were able to concentrate on both wings
batteries of two hundred guns and upwards, it would have been practically
impossible, owing to the section of the slopes of the French position, to c=
arry
out the old-fashioned case-shot attack at all. Nowadays there would be no
difficulty in turning on the fire of two thousand guns on any point of the
position, and switching this fire up and down the line like water from a
fire-engine hose, if the occasion demanded such concentration.
</p>

<p>
But these alterations in method make no difference in the truth of the pict=
ure
of War which Clausewitz presents, with which every soldier, and above all e=
very
Leader, should be saturated.
</p>

<p>
Death, wounds, suffering, and privation remain the same, whatever the weapo=
ns
employed, and their reaction on the ultimate nature of man is the same now =
as
in the struggle a century ago. It is this reaction that the Great Commander=
 has
to understand and prepare himself to control; and the task becomes ever gre=
ater
as, fortunately for humanity, the opportunities for gathering experience be=
come
more rare.
</p>

<p>
In the end, and with every improvement in science, the result depends more =
and
more on the character of the Leader and his power of resisting =E2=80=9Cthe

<h3><a name=3D"pref02"></a>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h3>

<p>
It will naturally excite surprise that a preface by a female hand should
accompany a work on such a subject as the present. For my friends no
explanation of the circumstance is required; but I hope by a simple relatio=
n of
the cause to clear myself of the appearance of presumption in the eyes also=
 of
those to whom I am not known.
</p>

<p>
The work to which these lines serve as a preface occupied almost entirely t=
he
last twelve years of the life of my inexpressibly beloved husband, who has
unfortunately been torn too soon from myself and his country. To complete i=
t
was his most earnest desire; but it was not his intention that it should be
published during his life; and if I tried to persuade him to alter that
intention, he often answered, half in jest, but also, perhaps, half in a
foreboding of early death: =E2=80=9C<i>Thou</i> shalt publish it.=E2=80=9D =
These words
(which in those happy days often drew tears from me, little as I was inclin=
ed
to attach a serious meaning to them) make it now, in the opinion of my frie=
nds,
a duty incumbent on me to introduce the posthumous works of my beloved husb=
and,
with a few prefatory lines from myself; and although here may be a differen=
ce
of opinion on this point, still I am sure there will be no mistake as to th=
e
feeling which has prompted me to overcome the timidity which makes any such
appearance, even in a subordinate part, so difficult for a woman.
</p>

<p>
It will be understood, as a matter of course, that I cannot have the most
remote intention of considering myself as the real editress of a work which=
 is
far above the scope of my capacity: I only stand at its side as an affectio=
nate
companion on its entrance into the world. This position I may well claim, a=
s a
similar one was allowed me during its formation and progress. Those who are
acquainted with our happy married life, and know how we shared <i>everythin=
g</i> with
each other=E2=80=94not only joy and sorrow, but also every occupation, ever=
y
interest of daily life=E2=80=94will understand that my beloved husband coul=
d not
be occupied on a work of this kind without its being known to me. Therefore=
, no
one can like me bear testimony to the zeal, to the love with which he labou=
red
on it, to the hopes which he bound up with it, as well as the manner and ti=
me
of its elaboration. His richly gifted mind had from his early youth longed =
for
light and truth, and, varied as were his talents, still he had chiefly dire=
cted
his reflections to the science of war, to which the duties of his professio=
n
called him, and which are of such importance for the benefit of States.
Scharnhorst was the first to lead him into the right road, and his subseque=
nt
appointment in 1810 as Instructor at the General War School, as well as the
honour conferred on him at the same time of giving military instruction to
H.R.H. the Crown Prince, tended further to give his investigations and stud=
ies
that direction, and to lead him to put down in writing whatever conclusions=
 he
arrived at. A paper with which he finished the instruction of H.R.H. the Cr=
own
Prince contains the germ of his subsequent works. But it was in the year 18=
16,
at Coblentz, that he first devoted himself again to scientific labours, and=
 to
collecting the fruits which his rich experience in those four eventful year=
s
had brought to maturity. He wrote down his views, in the first place, in sh=
ort
essays, only loosely connected with each other. The following, without date=
,
which has been found amongst his papers, seems to belong to those early day=
s.
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CIn the principles here committed to paper, in my opinion, the chie=
f
things which compose Strategy, as it is called, are touched upon. I looked =
upon
them only as materials, and had just got to such a length towards the mould=
ing
them into a whole.
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CThese materials have been amassed without any regularly preconceiv=
ed
plan. My view was at first, without regard to system and strict connection,=
 to
put down the results of my reflections upon the most important points in qu=
ite
brief, precise, compact propositions. The manner in which Montesquieu has
treated his subject floated before me in idea. I thought that concise,
sententious chapters, which I proposed at first to call grains, would attra=
ct
the attention of the intelligent just as much by that which was to be devel=
oped
from them, as by that which they contained in themselves. I had, therefore,
before me in idea, intelligent readers already acquainted with the subject.=
 But
my nature, which always impels me to development and systematising, at last
worked its way out also in this instance. For some time I was able to confi=
ne
myself to extracting only the most important results from the essays, which=
, to
attain clearness and conviction in my own mind, I wrote upon different
subjects, to concentrating in that manner their spirit in a small compass; =
but
afterwards my peculiarity gained ascendency completely=E2=80=94I have devel=
oped
what I could, and thus naturally have supposed a reader not yet acquainted =
with
the subject.
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CThe more I advanced with the work, and the more I yielded to the s=
pirit
of investigation, so much the more I was also led to system; and thus, then=
,
chapter after chapter has been inserted.
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CMy ultimate view has now been to go through the whole once more, t=
o
establish by further explanation much of the earlier treatises, and perhaps=
 to
condense into results many analyses on the later ones, and thus to make a
moderate whole out of it, forming a small octavo volume. But it was my wish
also in this to avoid everything common, everything that is plain of itself=
,
that has been said a hundred times, and is generally accepted; for my ambit=
ion
was to write a book that would not be forgotten in two or three years, and
which any one interested in the subject would at all events take up more th=
an
once.=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
In Coblentz, where he was much occupied with duty, he could only give
occasional hours to his private studies. It was not until 1818, after his
appointment as Director of the General Academy of War at Berlin, that he ha=
d
the leisure to expand his work, and enrich it from the history of modern wa=
rs.
This leisure also reconciled him to his new avocation, which, in other
respects, was not satisfactory to him, as, according to the existing
organisation of the Academy, the scientific part of the course is not under=
 the
Director, but conducted by a Board of Studies. Free as he was from all pett=
y
vanity, from every feeling of restless, egotistical ambition, still he felt=
 a
desire to be really useful, and not to leave inactive the abilities with wh=
ich
God had endowed him. In active life he was not in a position in which this
longing could be satisfied, and he had little hope of attaining to any such
position: his whole energies were therefore directed upon the domain of
science, and the benefit which he hoped to lay the foundation of by his wor=
k
was the object of his life. That, notwithstanding this, the resolution not =
to
let the work appear until after his death became more confirmed is the best
proof that no vain, paltry longing for praise and distinction, no particle =
of
egotistical views, was mixed up with this noble aspiration for great and
lasting usefulness.
</p>

<p>
Thus he worked diligently on, until, in the spring of 1830, he was appointe=
d to
the artillery, and his energies were called into activity in such a differe=
nt
sphere, and to such a high degree, that he was obliged, for the moment at
least, to give up all literary work. He then put his papers in order, seale=
d up
the separate packets, labelled them, and took sorrowful leave of this
employment which he loved so much. He was sent to Breslau in August of the =
same
year, as Chief of the Second Artillery District, but in December recalled t=
o
Berlin, and appointed Chief of the Staff to Field-Marshal Count Gneisenau (=
for
the term of his command). In March 1831, he accompanied his revered Command=
er
to Posen. When he returned from there to Breslau in November after the
melancholy event which had taken place, he hoped to resume his work and per=
haps
complete it in the course of the winter. The Almighty has willed it should =
be
otherwise. On the 7th November he returned to Breslau; on the 16th he was n=
o
more; and the packets sealed by himself were not opened until after his dea=
th.
</p>

<p>
The papers thus left are those now made public in the following volumes,
exactly in the condition in which they were found, without a word being add=
ed
or erased. Still, however, there was much to do before publication, in the =
way
of putting them in order and consulting about them; and I am deeply indebte=
d to
several sincere friends for the assistance they have afforded me, particula=
rly
Major O=E2=80=99Etzel, who kindly undertook the correction of the Press, as=
 well
as the preparation of the maps to accompany the historical parts of the wor=
k. I
must also mention my much-loved brother, who was my support in the hour of =
my
misfortune, and who has also done much for me in respect of these papers;
amongst other things, by carefully examining and putting them in order, he
found the commencement of the revision which my dear husband <i>wrote in th=
e year</i>
1827, and mentions in the <i>Notice</i> hereafter annexed as a work he had =
in view.
This revision has been inserted in the place intended for it in the first b=
ook
(for it does not go any further).
</p>

<p>
There are still many other friends to whom I might offer my thanks for thei=
r
advice, for the sympathy and friendship which they have shown me; but if I =
do
not name them all, they will, I am sure, not have any doubts of my sincere
gratitude. It is all the greater, from my firm conviction that all they hav=
e
done was not only on my own account, but for the friend whom God has thus
called away from them so soon.
</p>

<p>
If I have been highly blessed as the wife of such a man during one and twen=
ty
years, so am I still, notwithstanding my irreparable loss, by the treasure =
of
my recollections and of my hopes, by the rich legacy of sympathy and friend=
ship
which I owe the beloved departed, by the elevating feeling which I experien=
ce
at seeing his rare worth so generally and honourably acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
The trust confided to me by a Royal Couple is a fresh benefit for which I h=
ave
to thank the Almighty, as it opens to me an honourable occupation, to which
I devote myself. May this occupation be blessed, and may the dear little Pr=
ince
who is now entrusted to my care, some day read this book, and be animated b=
y it
to deeds like those of his glorious ancestors.

<h3><a name=3D"pref03"></a>NOTICE</h3>

<p>
I look upon the first six books, of which a fair copy has now been made, as
only a mass which is still in a manner without form, and which has yet to b=
e
again revised. In this revision the two kinds of War will be everywhere kep=
t
more distinctly in view, by which all ideas will acquire a clearer meaning,=
 a
more precise direction, and a closer application. The two kinds of War are,
first, those in which the object is the <i>overthrow of the enemy</i>, whet=
her it be
that we aim at his destruction, politically, or merely at disarming him and
forcing him to conclude peace on our terms; and next, those in which our ob=
ject
is <i>merely to make some conquests on the frontiers of his country</i>, ei=
ther for
the purpose of retaining them permanently, or of turning them to account as
matter of exchange in the settlement of a peace. Transition from one kind t=
o
the other must certainly continue to exist, but the completely different na=
ture
of the tendencies of the two must everywhere appear, and must separate from
each other things which are incompatible.
</p>

<p>
Besides establishing this real difference in Wars, another practically
necessary point of view must at the same time be established, which is, tha=
t
<i>War is only a continuation of State policy by other means</i>. This poin=
t of view
being adhered to everywhere, will introduce much more unity into the
consideration of the subject, and things will be more easily disentangled f=
rom
each other. Although the chief application of this point of view does not
commence until we get to the eighth book, still it must be completely devel=
oped
in the first book, and also lend assistance throughout the revision of the
first six books. Through such a revision the first six books will get rid o=
f a
good deal of dross, many rents and chasms will be closed up, and much that =
is
of a general nature will be transformed into distinct conceptions and forms=
.
</p>

<p>
The seventh book=E2=80=94on attack=E2=80=94for the different chapters of wh=
ich
sketches are already made, is to be considered as a reflection of the sixth=
,
and must be completed at once, according to the above-mentioned more distin=
ct
points of view, so that it will require no fresh revision, but rather may s=
erve
as a model in the revision of the first six books.
</p>

<p>
For the eighth book=E2=80=94on the <i>Plan of a War</i>, that is, of the or=
ganisation of
a whole War in general=E2=80=94several chapters are designed, but they are =
not at
all to be regarded as real materials, they are merely a track, roughly clea=
red,
as it were, through the mass, in order by that means to ascertain the point=
s of
most importance. They have answered this object, and I propose, on finishin=
g
the seventh book, to proceed at once to the working out of the eighth, wher=
e
the two points of view above mentioned will be chiefly affirmed, by which
everything will be simplified, and at the same time have a spirit breathed =
into
it. I hope in this book to iron out many creases in the heads of strategist=
s
and statesmen, and at least to show the object of action, and the real poin=
t to
be considered in War.
</p>

<p>
Now, when I have brought my ideas clearly out by finishing this eighth book=
,
and have properly established the leading features of War, it will be easie=
r
for me to carry the spirit of these ideas in to the first six books, and to
make these same features show themselves everywhere. Therefore I shall defe=
r
till then the revision of the first six books.
</p>

<p>
Should the work be interrupted by my death, then what is found can only be
called a mass of conceptions not brought into form; but as these are open t=
o
endless misconceptions, they will doubtless give rise to a number of crude
criticisms: for in these things, every one thinks, when he takes up his pen=
,
that whatever comes into his head is worth saying and printing, and quite a=
s
incontrovertible as that twice two make four. If such a one would take the
pains, as I have done, to think over the subject, for years, and to compare=
 his
ideas with military history, he would certainly be a little more guarded in=
 his
criticism.
</p>

<p>
Still, notwithstanding this imperfect form, I believe that an impartial rea=
der
thirsting for truth and conviction will rightly appreciate in the first six
books the fruits of several years=E2=80=99 reflection and a diligent study =
of
War, and that, perhaps, he will find in them some leading ideas which may b=
ring
about a revolution in the theory of War.

Besides this notice, amongst the papers left the following unfinished
memorandum was found, which appears of very recent date:
</p>

<p>
The manuscript on the conduct of the <i>Grande Guerre</i>, which will be fo=
und after
my death, in its present state can only be regarded as a collection of
materials from which it is intended to construct a theory of War. With the
greater part I am not yet satisfied; and the sixth book is to be looked at =
as a
mere essay: I should have completely remodelled it, and have tried a differ=
ent
line.
</p>

<p>
But the ruling principles which pervade these materials I hold to be the ri=
ght
ones: they are the result of a very varied reflection, keeping always in vi=
ew
the reality, and always bearing in mind what I have learnt by experience an=
d by
my intercourse with distinguished soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The seventh book is to contain the attack, the subjects of which are thrown
together in a hasty manner: the eighth, the plan for a War, in which I woul=
d
have examined War more especially in its political and human aspects.
</p>

<p>
The first chapter of the first book is the only one which I consider as
completed; it will at least serve to show the manner in which I proposed to
treat the subject throughout.
</p>

<p>
The theory of the <i>Grande Guerre</i>, or Strategy, as it is called, is be=
set with
extraordinary difficulties, and we may affirm that very few men have clear
conceptions of the separate subjects, that is, conceptions carried up to th=
eir
full logical conclusions. In real action most men are guided merely by the =
tact
of judgment which hits the object more or less accurately, according as the=
y
possess more or less genius.
</p>

<p>
This is the way in which all great Generals have acted, and therein partly =
lay
their greatness and their genius, that they always hit upon what was right =
by
this tact. Thus also it will always be in action, and so far this tact is a=
mply
sufficient. But when it is a question, not of acting oneself, but of convin=
cing
others in a consultation, then all depends on clear conceptions and
demonstration of the inherent relations, and so little progress has been ma=
de
in this respect that most deliberations are merely a contention of words,
resting on no firm basis, and ending either in every one retaining his own
opinion, or in a compromise from mutual considerations of respect, a middle
course really without any value.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Herr Clausewitz evidently had before his mind the endless consultations=
 at
the Headquarters of the Bohemian Army in the Leipsic Campaign 1813.
</p>

<p>
Clear ideas on these matters are therefore not wholly useless; besides, the
human mind has a general tendency to clearness, and always wants to be
consistent with the necessary order of things.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the great difficulties attending a philosophical construction of t=
he
Art of War, and the many attempts at it that have failed, most people have =
come
to the conclusion that such a theory is impossible, because it concerns thi=
ngs
which no standing law can embrace. We should also join in this opinion and =
give
up any attempt at a theory, were it not that a great number of propositions
make themselves evident without any difficulty, as, for instance, that the
defensive form, with a negative object, is the stronger form, the attack, w=
ith
the positive object, the weaker=E2=80=94that great results carry the little=
 ones
with them=E2=80=94that, therefore, strategic effects may be referred to cer=

centres of gravity=E2=80=94that a demonstration is a weaker application of =
force
than a real attack, that, therefore, there must be some special reason for
resorting to the former=E2=80=94that victory consists not merely in the con=

<h3><a name=3D"pref04"></a>THE INTRODUCTION OF THE AUTHOR</h3>

<p>
That the conception of the scientific does not consist alone, or chiefly, i=
n
system, and its finished theoretical constructions, requires nowadays no
exposition. System in this treatise is not to be found on the surface, and
instead of a finished building of theory, there are only materials.
</p>

<p>
The scientific form lies here in the endeavour to explore the nature of
military phenomena to show their affinity with the nature of the things of
which they are composed. Nowhere has the philosophical argument been evaded=
,
but where it runs out into too thin a thread the Author has preferred to cu=
t it
short, and fall back upon the corresponding results of experience; for in t=
he
same way as many plants only bear fruit when they do not shoot too high, so=
 in
the practical arts the theoretical leaves and flowers must not be made to
sprout too far, but kept near to experience, which is their proper soil.
</p>

<p>
Unquestionably it would be a mistake to try to discover from the chemical
ingredients of a grain of corn the form of the ear of corn which it bears, =
as
we have only to go to the field to see the ears ripe. Investigation and
observation, philosophy and experience, must neither despise nor exclude on=
e
another; they mutually afford each other the rights of citizenship.
Consequently, the propositions of this book, with their arch of inherent
necessity, are supported either by experience or by the conception of War
itself as external points, so that they are not without abutments.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) That this is not the case in the works of many military writers especia=
lly
of those who have aimed at treating of War itself in a scientific manner, i=
s
shown in many instances, in which by their reasoning, the pro and contra
swallow each other up so effectually that there is no vestige of the tails =
even
which were left in the case of the two lions.
</p>

<p>
It is, perhaps, not impossible to write a systematic theory of War full of
spirit and substance, but ours hitherto, have been very much the reverse. T=
o
say nothing of their unscientific spirit, in their striving after coherence=
 and
completeness of system, they overflow with commonplaces, truisms, and twadd=
le
of every kind. If we want a striking picture of them we have only to read
Lichtenberg=E2=80=99s extract from a code of regulations in case of fire.
</p>

<p>
If a house takes fire, we must seek, above all things, to protect the right
side of the house standing on the left, and, on the other hand, the left si=
de
of the house on the right; for if we, for example, should protect the left =
side
of the house on the left, then the right side of the house lies to the righ=
t of
the left, and consequently as the fire lies to the right of this side, and =
of
the right side (for we have assumed that the house is situated to the left =
of
the fire), therefore the right side is situated nearer to the fire than the
left, and the right side of the house might catch fire if it was not protec=
ted
before it came to the left, which is protected. Consequently, something mig=
ht
be burnt that is not protected, and that sooner than something else would b=
e
burnt, even if it was not protected; consequently we must let alone the lat=
ter
and protect the former. In order to impress the thing on one=E2=80=99s mind=
, we
have only to note if the house is situated to the right of the fire, then i=
t is
the left side, and if the house is to the left it is the right side.
</p>

<p>
In order not to frighten the intelligent reader by such commonplaces, and t=
o
make the little good that there is distasteful by pouring water upon it, th=
e
Author has preferred to give in small ingots of fine metal his impressions =
and
convictions, the result of many years=E2=80=99 reflection on War, of his
intercourse with men of ability, and of much personal experience. Thus the
seemingly weakly bound-together chapters of this book have arisen, but it i=
s
hoped they will not be found wanting in logical connection. Perhaps soon a
greater head may appear, and instead of these single grains, give the whole=
 in
a casting of pure metal without dross.

<h3><a name=3D"pref05"></a>BRIEF MEMOIR OF GENERAL CLAUSEWITZ<br>
(BY TRANSLATOR)</h3>

<p>
The Author of the work here translated, General Carl Von Clausewitz, was bo=
rn
at Burg, near Magdeburg, in 1780, and entered the Prussian Army as Fahnenju=
nker
(<i>i.e.</i>, ensign) in 1792. He served in the campaigns of 1793-94 on the=
 Rhine,
after which he seems to have devoted some time to the study of the scientif=
ic
branches of his profession. In 1801 he entered the Military School at Berli=
n,
and remained there till 1803. During his residence there he attracted the
notice of General Scharnhorst, then at the head of the establishment; and t=
he
patronage of this distinguished officer had immense influence on his future
career, and we may gather from his writings that he ever afterwards continu=
ed
to entertain a high esteem for Scharnhorst. In the campaign of 1806 he serv=
ed
as Aide-de-camp to Prince Augustus of Prussia; and being wounded and taken
prisoner, he was sent into France until the close of that war. On his retur=
n,
he was placed on General Scharnhorst=E2=80=99s Staff, and employed in the w=
ork
then going on for the reorganisation of the Army. He was also at this time
selected as military instructor to the late King of Prussia, then Crown Pri=
nce.
In 1812 Clausewitz, with several other Prussian officers, having entered th=
e
Russian service, his first appointment was as Aide-de-camp to General Phul.
Afterwards, while serving with Wittgenstein=E2=80=99s army, he assisted in
negotiating the famous convention of Tauroggen with York. Of the part he to=
ok
in that affair he has left an interesting account in his work on the
=E2=80=9CRussian Campaign.=E2=80=9D It is there stated that, in order to br=
ing the
correspondence which had been carried on with York to a termination in one =
way
or another, the Author was despatched to York=E2=80=99s headquarters with t=
wo
letters, one was from General d=E2=80=99Auvray, the Chief of the Staff of
Wittgenstein=E2=80=99s army, to General Diebitsch, showing the arrangements=
 made
to cut off York=E2=80=99s corps from Macdonald (this was necessary in order=
 to
give York a plausible excuse for seceding from the French); the other was a=
n
intercepted letter from Macdonald to the Duke of Bassano. With regard to th=
e
former of these, the Author says, =E2=80=9Cit would not have had weight wit=
h a
man like York, but for a military justification, if the Prussian Court shou=
ld
require one as against the French, it was important.=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
The second letter was calculated at the least to call up in General
York=E2=80=99s mind all the feelings of bitterness which perhaps for some d=
ays
past had been diminished by the consciousness of his own behaviour towards =
the
writer.
</p>

<p>
As the Author entered General York=E2=80=99s chamber, the latter called out=
 to
him, =E2=80=9CKeep off from me; I will have nothing more to do with you; yo=
ur
d=E2=80=94=E2=80=94d Cossacks have let a letter of Macdonald=E2=80=99s pass=
 through
them, which brings me an order to march on Piktrepohnen, in order there to
effect our junction. All doubt is now at an end; your troops do not come up=
;
you are too weak; march I must, and I must excuse myself from further
negotiation, which may cost me my head.=E2=80=9D The Author said that he wo=
uld
make no opposition to all this, but begged for a candle, as he had letters =
to
show the General, and, as the latter seemed still to hesitate, the Author
added, =E2=80=9CYour Excellency will not surely place me in the embarrassme=
nt of
departing without having executed my commission.=E2=80=9D The General order=
ed
candles, and called in Colonel von Roeder, the chief of his staff, from the
ante-chamber. The letters were read. After a pause of an instant, the Gener=
al
said, =E2=80=9CClausewitz, you are a Prussian, do you believe that the lett=
er of
General d=E2=80=99Auvray is sincere, and that Wittgenstein=E2=80=99s troops=
 will
really be at the points he mentioned on the 31st?=E2=80=9D The Author repli=
ed,
=E2=80=9CI pledge myself for the sincerity of this letter upon the knowledg=
e I
have of General d=E2=80=99Auvray and the other men of Wittgenstein=E2=80=99=
s
headquarters; whether the dispositions he announces can be accomplished as =
he
lays down I certainly cannot pledge myself; for your Excellency knows that =
in
war we must often fall short of the line we have drawn for ourselves.=E2=80=
=9D
The General was silent for a few minutes of earnest reflection; then he hel=
d
out his hand to the Author, and said, =E2=80=9CYou have me. Tell General
Diebitsch that we must confer early to-morrow at the mill of Poschenen, and
that I am now firmly determined to separate myself from the French and thei=
r
cause.=E2=80=9D The hour was fixed for 8 A.M. After this was settled, the G=
eneral
added, =E2=80=9CBut I will not do the thing by halves, I will get you Masse=
nbach
also.=E2=80=9D He called in an officer who was of Massenbach=E2=80=99s cava=
lry, and
who had just left them. Much like Schiller=E2=80=99s Wallenstein, he asked,
walking up and down the room the while, =E2=80=9CWhat say your regiments?=
=E2=80=9D
The officer broke out with enthusiasm at the idea of a riddance from the Fr=
ench
alliance, and said that every man of the troops in question felt the same.
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CYou young ones may talk; but my older head is shaking on my
shoulders,=E2=80=9D replied the General.(*)

General Von Clausewitz (by Lord Ellesmere).
</p>

<p>
After the close of the Russian campaign Clausewitz remained in the service =
of
that country, but was attached as a Russian staff officer to Bl=C3=BCcher=
=E2=80=99s
headquarters till the Armistice in 1813.
</p>

<p>
In 1814, he became Chief of the Staff of General Walmoden=E2=80=99s Russo-G=
erman
Corps, which formed part of the Army of the North under Bernadotte. His nam=
e is
frequently mentioned with distinction in that campaign, particularly in
connection with the affair of Goehrde.
</p>

<p>
Clausewitz re-entered the Prussian service in 1815, and served as Chief of =
the
Staff to Thielman=E2=80=99s corps, which was engaged with Grouchy at Wavre,=
 on
the 18th of June.
</p>

<p>
After the Peace, he was employed in a command on the Rhine. In 1818, he bec=
ame
Major-General, and Director of the Military School at which he had been
previously educated.
</p>

<p>
In 1830, he was appointed Inspector of Artillery at Breslau, but soon after
nominated Chief of the Staff to the Army of Observation, under Marshal
Gneisenau on the Polish frontier.
</p>

<p>
The latest notices of his life and services are probably to be found in the
memoirs of General Brandt, who, from being on the staff of Gneisenau=E2=80=
=99s
army, was brought into daily intercourse with Clausewitz in matters of duty=
,
and also frequently met him at the table of Marshal Gneisenau, at Posen.
</p>

<p>
Amongst other anecdotes, General Brandt relates that, upon one occasion, th=
e
conversation at the Marshal=E2=80=99s table turned upon a sermon preached b=
y a
priest, in which some great absurdities were introduced, and a discussion a=
rose
as to whether the Bishop should not be made responsible for what the priest=
 had
said. This led to the topic of theology in general, when General Brandt,
speaking of himself, says, =E2=80=9CI expressed an opinion that theology is=
 only
to be regarded as an historical process, as a <i>moment</i> in the gradual =
development
of the human race. This brought upon me an attack from all quarters, but mo=
re
especially from Clausewitz, who ought to have been on my side, he having be=
en
an adherent and pupil of Kiesewetter=E2=80=99s, who had indoctrinated him i=
n the
philosophy of Kant, certainly diluted=E2=80=94I might even say in hom=C5=93=
opathic
doses.=E2=80=9D This anecdote is only interesting as the mention of Kiesewe=
tter
points to a circumstance in the life of Clausewitz that may have had an
influence in forming those habits of thought which distinguish his writings=
.
</p>

<p>
=E2=80=9CThe way,=E2=80=9D says General Brandt, =E2=80=9Cin which General C=
lausewitz
judged of things, drew conclusions from movements and marches, calculated t=
he
times of the marches, and the points where decisions would take place, was
extremely interesting. Fate has unfortunately denied him an opportunity of
showing his talents in high command, but I have a firm persuasion that as a
strategist he would have greatly distinguished himself. As a leader on the
field of battle, on the other hand, he would not have been so much in his r=
ight
place, from a <i>manque d=E2=80=99habitude du commandement</i>, he wanted t=
he art
<i>d=E2=80=99enlever les troupes</i>.=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
After the Prussian Army of Observation was dissolved, Clausewitz returned t=
o
Breslau, and a few days after his arrival was seized with cholera, the seed=
s of
which he must have brought with him from the army on the Polish frontier. H=
is
death took place in November 1831.
</p>

<p>
His writings are contained in nine volumes, published after his death, but =
his
fame rests most upon the three volumes forming his treatise on
=E2=80=9CWar.=E2=80=9D In the present attempt to render into English this p=
ortion
of the works of Clausewitz, the translator is sensible of many deficiencies=
,
but he hopes at all events to succeed in making this celebrated treatise be=
tter
known in England, believing, as he does, that so far as the work concerns t=
he
interests of this country, it has lost none of the importance it possessed =
at
the time of its first publication.

<h4>1. INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>
We propose to consider first the single elements of our subject, then each
branch or part, and, last of all, the whole, in all its
relations=E2=80=94therefore to advance from the simple to the complex. But =
it is
necessary for us to commence with a glance at the nature of the whole, beca=
use
it is particularly necessary that in the consideration of any of the parts
their relation to the whole should be kept constantly in view.
</p>

<h4>
2. DEFINITION.
</h4>

<p>
We shall not enter into any of the abstruse definitions of War used by
publicists. We shall keep to the element of the thing itself, to a duel. Wa=
r is
nothing but a duel on an extensive scale. If we would conceive as a unit th=
e
countless number of duels which make up a War, we shall do so best by suppo=
sing
to ourselves two wrestlers. Each strives by physical force to compel the ot=
her
to submit to his will: each endeavours to throw his adversary, and thus ren=
der
him incapable of further resistance.
</p>

<p>
<i>War therefore is an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to f=
ulfil
our will.</i>
</p>

<p>
Violence arms itself with the inventions of Art and Science in order to con=
tend
against violence. Self-imposed restrictions, almost imperceptible and hardl=
y
worth mentioning, termed usages of International Law, accompany it without
essentially impairing its power. Violence, that is to say, physical force (=
for
there is no moral force without the conception of States and Law), is there=
fore
the <i>means;</i> the compulsory submission of the enemy to our will is the=
 ultimate
object. In order to attain this object fully, the enemy must be disarmed, a=
nd
disarmament becomes therefore the immediate <i>object</i> of hostilities in=
 theory. It
takes the place of the final object, and puts it aside as something we can
eliminate from our calculations.
</p>

<h4>
3. UTMOST USE OF FORCE.
</h4>

<p>
Now, philanthropists may easily imagine there is a skilful method of disarm=
ing
and overcoming an enemy without great bloodshed, and that this is the prope=
r
tendency of the Art of War. However plausible this may appear, still it is =
an
error which must be extirpated; for in such dangerous things as War, the er=
rors
which proceed from a spirit of benevolence are the worst. As the use of
physical power to the utmost extent by no means excludes the co-operation o=
f
the intelligence, it follows that he who uses force unsparingly, without
reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adver=
sary
uses less vigour in its application. The former then dictates the law to th=
e
latter, and both proceed to extremities to which the only limitations are t=
hose
imposed by the amount of counter-acting force on each side.
</p>

<p>
This is the way in which the matter must be viewed and it is to no purpose,=
 it
is even against one=E2=80=99s own interest, to turn away from the considera=
tion
of the real nature of the affair because the horror of its elements excites
repugnance.
</p>

<p>
If the Wars of civilised people are less cruel and destructive than those o=
f
savages, the difference arises from the social condition both of States in
themselves and in their relations to each other. Out of this social conditi=
on
and its relations War arises, and by it War is subjected to conditions, is
controlled and modified. But these things do not belong to War itself; they=
 are
only given conditions; and to introduce into the philosophy of War itself a
principle of moderation would be an absurdity.
</p>

<p>
Two motives lead men to War: instinctive hostility and hostile intention. I=
n
our definition of War, we have chosen as its characteristic the latter of t=
hese
elements, because it is the most general. It is impossible to conceive the
passion of hatred of the wildest description, bordering on mere instinct,
without combining with it the idea of a hostile intention. On the other han=
d,
hostile intentions may often exist without being accompanied by any, or at =
all
events by any extreme, hostility of feeling. Amongst savages views emanatin=
g
from the feelings, amongst civilised nations those emanating from the
understanding, have the predominance; but this difference arises from atten=
dant
circumstances, existing institutions, &amp;c., and, therefore, is not to be
found necessarily in all cases, although it prevails in the majority. In sh=
ort,
even the most civilised nations may burn with passionate hatred of each oth=
er.
</p>

<p>
We may see from this what a fallacy it would be to refer the War of a civil=
ised
nation entirely to an intelligent act on the part of the Government, and to
imagine it as continually freeing itself more and more from all feeling of
passion in such a way that at last the physical masses of combatants would =
no
longer be required; in reality, their mere relations would suffice=E2=80=94=
a kind
of algebraic action.
</p>

<p>
Theory was beginning to drift in this direction until the facts of the last
War(*) taught it better. If War is an <i>act</i> of force, it belongs neces=
sarily also
to the feelings. If it does not originate in the feelings, it <i>reacts</i>=
, more or
less, upon them, and the extent of this reaction depends not on the degree =
of
civilisation, but upon the importance and duration of the interests involve=
d.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Clausewitz alludes here to the =E2=80=9CWars of Liberation,=E2=80=9D
1813, 14, 15.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if we find civilised nations do not put their prisoners to death=
, do
not devastate towns and countries, this is because their intelligence exerc=
ises
greater influence on their mode of carrying on War, and has taught them mor=
e
effectual means of applying force than these rude acts of mere instinct. Th=
e
invention of gunpowder, the constant progress of improvements in the
construction of firearms, are sufficient proofs that the tendency to destro=
y
the adversary which lies at the bottom of the conception of War is in no wa=
y
changed or modified through the progress of civilisation.
</p>

<p>
We therefore repeat our proposition, that War is an act of violence pushed =
to
its utmost bounds; as one side dictates the law to the other, there arises =
a
sort of reciprocal action, which logically must lead to an extreme. This is=
 the
first reciprocal action, and the first extreme with which we meet (<i>first
reciprocal action</i>).
</p>

<h4>
4. THE AIM IS TO DISARM THE ENEMY.
</h4>

<p>
We have already said that the aim of all action in War is to disarm the ene=
my,
and we shall now show that this, theoretically at least, is indispensable.
</p>

<p>
If our opponent is to be made to comply with our will, we must place him in=
 a
situation which is more oppressive to him than the sacrifice which we deman=
d;
but the disadvantages of this position must naturally not be of a transitor=
y
nature, at least in appearance, otherwise the enemy, instead of yielding, w=
ill
hold out, in the prospect of a change for the better. Every change in this
position which is produced by a continuation of the War should therefore be=
 a
change for the worse. The worst condition in which a belligerent can be pla=
ced
is that of being completely disarmed. If, therefore, the enemy is to be red=
uced
to submission by an act of War, he must either be positively disarmed or pl=
aced
in such a position that he is threatened with it. From this it follows that=
 the
disarming or overthrow of the enemy, whichever we call it, must always be t=
he
aim of Warfare. Now War is always the shock of two hostile bodies in collis=
ion,
not the action of a living power upon an inanimate mass, because an absolut=
e
state of endurance would not be making War; therefore, what we have just sa=
id
as to the aim of action in War applies to both parties. Here, then, is anot=
her
case of reciprocal action. As long as the enemy is not defeated, he may def=
eat
me; then I shall be no longer my own master; he will dictate the law to me =
as I
did to him. This is the second reciprocal action, and leads to a second ext=
reme
(<i>second reciprocal action</i>).
</p>

<h4>
5. UTMOST EXERTION OF POWERS.
</h4>

<p>
If we desire to defeat the enemy, we must proportion our efforts to his pow=
ers
of resistance. This is expressed by the product of two factors which cannot=
 be
separated, namely, <i>the sum of available means</i> and <i>the strength of=
 the Will</i>. The
sum of the available means may be estimated in a measure, as it depends
(although not entirely) upon numbers; but the strength of volition is more
difficult to determine, and can only be estimated to a certain extent by th=
e
strength of the motives. Granted we have obtained in this way an approximat=
ion
to the strength of the power to be contended with, we can then take of our =
own
means, and either increase them so as to obtain a preponderance, or, in cas=
e we
have not the resources to effect this, then do our best by increasing our m=
eans
as far as possible. But the adversary does the same; therefore, there is a =
new
mutual enhancement, which, in pure conception, must create a fresh effort
towards an extreme. This is the third case of reciprocal action, and a thir=
d
extreme with which we meet (<i>third reciprocal action</i>).
</p>

<h4>
6. MODIFICATION IN THE REALITY.
</h4>

<p>
Thus reasoning in the abstract, the mind cannot stop short of an extreme,
because it has to deal with an extreme, with a conflict of forces left to
themselves, and obeying no other but their own inner laws. If we should see=
k to
deduce from the pure conception of War an absolute point for the aim which =
we
shall propose and for the means which we shall apply, this constant recipro=
cal
action would involve us in extremes, which would be nothing but a play of i=
deas
produced by an almost invisible train of logical subtleties. If, adhering
closely to the absolute, we try to avoid all difficulties by a stroke of th=
e
pen, and insist with logical strictness that in every case the extreme must=
 be
the object, and the utmost effort must be exerted in that direction, such a
stroke of the pen would be a mere paper law, not by any means adapted to th=
e
real world.
</p>

<p>
Even supposing this extreme tension of forces was an absolute which could
easily be ascertained, still we must admit that the human mind would hardly
submit itself to this kind of logical chimera. There would be in many cases=
 an
unnecessary waste of power, which would be in opposition to other principle=
s of
statecraft; an effort of Will would be required disproportioned to the prop=
osed
object, which therefore it would be impossible to realise, for the human wi=
ll
does not derive its impulse from logical subtleties.
</p>

<p>
But everything takes a different shape when we pass from abstractions to
reality. In the former, everything must be subject to optimism, and we must
imagine the one side as well as the other striving after perfection and eve=
n
attaining it. Will this ever take place in reality? It will if,
</p>

<p>
(1) War becomes a completely isolated act, which arises suddenly, and is in=
 no
way connected with the previous history of the combatant States.
</p>

<p>
(2) If it is limited to a single solution, or to several simultaneous
solutions.
</p>

<p>
(3) If it contains within itself the solution perfect and complete, free fr=
om
any reaction upon it, through a calculation beforehand of the political
situation which will follow from it.
</p>

<h4>
7. WAR IS NEVER AN ISOLATED ACT.
</h4>

<p>
With regard to the first point, neither of the two opponents is an abstract
person to the other, not even as regards that factor in the sum of resistan=
ce
which does not depend on objective things, viz., the Will. This Will is not=
 an
entirely unknown quantity; it indicates what it will be to-morrow by what i=
t is
to-day. War does not spring up quite suddenly, it does not spread to the fu=
ll
in a moment; each of the two opponents can, therefore, form an opinion of t=
he
other, in a great measure, from what he is and what he does, instead of jud=
ging
of him according to what he, strictly speaking, should be or should do. But=
,
now, man with his incomplete organisation is always below the line of absol=
ute
perfection, and thus these deficiencies, having an influence on both sides,
become a modifying principle.
</p>

<h4>
8. WAR DOES NOT CONSIST OF A SINGLE INSTANTANEOUS BLOW.
</h4>

<p>
The second point gives rise to the following considerations:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
If War ended in a single solution, or a number of simultaneous ones, then
naturally all the preparations for the same would have a tendency to the
extreme, for an omission could not in any way be repaired; the utmost, then=
,
that the world of reality could furnish as a guide for us would be the
preparations of the enemy, as far as they are known to us; all the rest wou=
ld
fall into the domain of the abstract. But if the result is made up from sev=
eral
successive acts, then naturally that which precedes with all its phases may=
 be
taken as a measure for that which will follow, and in this manner the world=
 of
reality again takes the place of the abstract, and thus modifies the effort
towards the extreme.
</p>

<p>
Yet every War would necessarily resolve itself into a single solution, or a=
 sum
of simultaneous results, if all the means required for the struggle were ra=
ised
at once, or could be at once raised; for as one adverse result necessarily
diminishes the means, then if all the means have been applied in the first,=
 a
second cannot properly be supposed. All hostile acts which might follow wou=
ld
belong essentially to the first, and form, in reality only its duration.
</p>

<p>
But we have already seen that even in the preparation for War the real worl=
d
steps into the place of mere abstract conception=E2=80=94a material standar=
d into
the place of the hypotheses of an extreme: that therefore in that way both
parties, by the influence of the mutual reaction, remain below the line of
extreme effort, and therefore all forces are not at once brought forward.
</p>

<p>
It lies also in the nature of these forces and their application that they
cannot all be brought into activity at the same time. These forces are <i>t=
he
armies actually on foot, the country</i>, with its superficial extent and i=
ts
population, <i>and the allies</i>.
</p>

<p>
In point of fact, the country, with its superficial area and the population=
,
besides being the source of all military force, constitutes in itself an
integral part of the efficient quantities in War, providing either the thea=
tre
of war or exercising a considerable influence on the same.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is possible to bring all the movable military forces of a country i=
nto
operation at once, but not all fortresses, rivers, mountains, people,
&amp;c.=E2=80=94in short, not the whole country, unless it is so small that=
 it
may be completely embraced by the first act of the War. Further, the
co-operation of allies does not depend on the Will of the belligerents; and
from the nature of the political relations of states to each other, this
co-operation is frequently not afforded until after the War has commenced, =
or
it may be increased to restore the balance of power.
</p>

<p>
That this part of the means of resistance, which cannot at once be brought =
into
activity, in many cases, is a much greater part of the whole than might at
first be supposed, and that it often restores the balance of power, serious=
ly
affected by the great force of the first decision, will be more fully shown
hereafter. Here it is sufficient to show that a complete concentration of a=
ll
available means in a moment of time is contradictory to the nature of War.
</p>

<p>
Now this, in itself, furnishes no ground for relaxing our efforts to accumu=
late
strength to gain the first result, because an unfavourable issue is always =
a
disadvantage to which no one would purposely expose himself, and also becau=
se
the first decision, although not the only one, still will have the more
influence on subsequent events, the greater it is in itself.
</p>

<p>
But the possibility of gaining a later result causes men to take refuge in =
that
expectation, owing to the repugnance in the human mind to making excessive
efforts; and therefore forces are not concentrated and measures are not tak=
en
for the first decision with that energy which would otherwise be used. What=
ever
one belligerent omits from weakness, becomes to the other a real objective
ground for limiting his own efforts, and thus again, through this reciproca=
l
action, extreme tendencies are brought down to efforts on a limited scale.
</p>

<h4>
9. THE RESULT IN WAR IS NEVER ABSOLUTE.
</h4>

<p>
Lastly, even the final decision of a whole War is not always to be regarded=
 as
absolute. The conquered State often sees in it only a passing evil, which m=
ay
be repaired in after times by means of political combinations. How much thi=
s
must modify the degree of tension, and the vigour of the efforts made, is
evident in itself.
</p>

10. THE PROBABILITIES OF REAL LIFE TAKE THE PLACE OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF THE
EXTREME AND THE ABSOLUTE.
</h4>

<p>
In this manner, the whole act of War is removed from the rigorous law of fo=
rces
exerted to the utmost. If the extreme is no longer to be apprehended, and n=
o
longer to be sought for, it is left to the judgment to determine the limits=
 for
the efforts to be made in place of it, and this can only be done on the dat=
a
furnished by the facts of the real world by the LAWS OF PROBABILITY. Once t=
he
belligerents are no longer mere conceptions, but individual States and
Governments, once the War is no longer an ideal, but a definite substantial
procedure, then the reality will furnish the data to compute the unknown
quantities which are required to be found.
</p>

<p>
From the character, the measures, the situation of the adversary, and the
relations with which he is surrounded, each side will draw conclusions by t=
he
law of probability as to the designs of the other, and act accordingly.
</p>

<h4>
11. THE POLITICAL OBJECT NOW REAPPEARS.
</h4>

<p>
Here the question which we had laid aside forces itself again into
consideration (see No. 2), viz., the political object of the War. The law o=
f
the extreme, the view to disarm the adversary, to overthrow him, has hither=
to
to a certain extent usurped the place of this end or object. Just as this l=
aw
loses its force, the political must again come forward. If the whole
consideration is a calculation of probability based on definite persons and
relations, then the political object, being the original motive, must be an
essential factor in the product. The smaller the sacrifice we demand from o=
urs,
the smaller, it may be expected, will be the means of resistance which he w=
ill
employ; but the smaller his preparation, the smaller will ours require to b=
e.
Further, the smaller our political object, the less value shall we set upon=
 it,
and the more easily shall we be induced to give it up altogether.
</p>

<p>
Thus, therefore, the political object, as the original motive of the War, w=
ill
be the standard for determining both the aim of the military force and also=
 the
amount of effort to be made. This it cannot be in itself, but it is so in
relation to both the belligerent States, because we are concerned with
realities, not with mere abstractions. One and the same political object ma=
y
produce totally different effects upon different people, or even upon the s=
ame
people at different times; we can, therefore, only admit the political obje=
ct
as the measure, by considering it in its effects upon those masses which it=
 is
to move, and consequently the nature of those masses also comes into
consideration. It is easy to see that thus the result may be very different
according as these masses are animated with a spirit which will infuse vigo=
ur
into the action or otherwise. It is quite possible for such a state of feel=
ing
to exist between two States that a very trifling political motive for War m=
ay
produce an effect quite disproportionate=E2=80=94in fact, a perfect explosi=
on.
</p>

<p>
This applies to the efforts which the political object will call forth in t=
he
two States, and to the aim which the military action shall prescribe for
itself. At times it may itself be that aim, as, for example, the conquest o=
f a
province. At other times the political object itself is not suitable for th=
e
aim of military action; then such a one must be chosen as will be an equiva=
lent
for it, and stand in its place as regards the conclusion of peace. But also=
, in
this, due attention to the peculiar character of the States concerned is al=
ways
supposed. There are circumstances in which the equivalent must be much grea=
ter
than the political object, in order to secure the latter. The political obj=
ect
will be so much the more the standard of aim and effort, and have more
influence in itself, the more the masses are indifferent, the less that any
mutual feeling of hostility prevails in the two States from other causes, a=
nd
therefore there are cases where the political object almost alone will be
decisive.
</p>

<p>
If the aim of the military action is an equivalent for the political object=
,
that action will in general diminish as the political object diminishes, an=
d in
a greater degree the more the political object dominates. Thus it is explai=
ned
how, without any contradiction in itself, there may be Wars of all degrees =
of
importance and energy, from a War of extermination down to the mere use of =
an
army of observation. This, however, leads to a question of another kind whi=
ch
we have hereafter to develop and answer.
</p>

<h4>
12. A SUSPENSION IN THE ACTION OF WAR UNEXPLAINED BY ANYTHING SAID AS YET.
</h4>

<p>
However insignificant the political claims mutually advanced, however weak =
the
means put forth, however small the aim to which military action is directed=
,
can this action be suspended even for a moment? This is a question which
penetrates deeply into the nature of the subject.
</p>

<p>
Every transaction requires for its accomplishment a certain time which we c=
all
its duration. This may be longer or shorter, according as the person acting
throws more or less despatch into his movements.
</p>

<p>
About this more or less we shall not trouble ourselves here. Each person ac=
ts
in his own fashion; but the slow person does not protract the thing because=
 he
wishes to spend more time about it, but because by his nature he requires m=
ore
time, and if he made more haste would not do the thing so well. This time,
therefore, depends on subjective causes, and belongs to the length, so call=
ed,
of the action.
</p>

<p>
If we allow now to every action in War this, its length, then we must assum=
e,
at first sight at least, that any expenditure of time beyond this length, t=
hat
is, every suspension of hostile action, appears an absurdity; with respect =
to
this it must not be forgotten that we now speak not of the progress of one =
or
other of the two opponents, but of the general progress of the whole action=
 of
the War.
</p>

<h4>
13. THERE IS ONLY ONE CAUSE WHICH CAN SUSPEND THE ACTION, AND THIS SEEMS TO=
 BE
ONLY POSSIBLE ON ONE SIDE IN ANY CASE.
</h4>

<p>
If two parties have armed themselves for strife, then a feeling of animosit=
y
must have moved them to it; as long now as they continue armed, that is, do=
 not
come to terms of peace, this feeling must exist; and it can only be brought=
 to
a standstill by either side by one single motive alone, which is, THAT HE W=
AITS
FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE MOMENT FOR ACTION. Now, at first sight, it appears th=
at
this motive can never exist except on one side, because it, eo ipso, must b=
e
prejudicial to the other. If the one has an interest in acting, then the ot=
her
must have an interest in waiting.
</p>

<p>
A complete equilibrium of forces can never produce a suspension of action, =
for
during this suspension he who has the positive object (that is, the assaila=
nt)
must continue progressing; for if we should imagine an equilibrium in this =
way,
that he who has the positive object, therefore the strongest motive, can at=
 the
same time only command the lesser means, so that the equation is made up by=
 the
product of the motive and the power, then we must say, if no alteration in =
this
condition of equilibrium is to be expected, the two parties must make peace=
;
but if an alteration is to be expected, then it can only be favourable to o=
ne
side, and therefore the other has a manifest interest to act without delay.=
 We
see that the conception of an equilibrium cannot explain a suspension of ar=
ms,
but that it ends in the question of the EXPECTATION OF A MORE FAVOURABLE
MOMENT.
</p>

<p>
Let us suppose, therefore, that one of two States has a positive object, as=
,
for instance, the conquest of one of the enemy=E2=80=99s provinces=E2=80=94=
which is
to be utilised in the settlement of peace. After this conquest, his politic=
al
object is accomplished, the necessity for action ceases, and for him a paus=
e
ensues. If the adversary is also contented with this solution, he will make
peace; if not, he must act. Now, if we suppose that in four weeks he will b=
e in
a better condition to act, then he has sufficient grounds for putting off t=
he
time of action.
</p>

<p>
But from that moment the logical course for the enemy appears to be to act =
that
he may not give the conquered party THE DESIRED time. Of course, in this mo=
de
of reasoning a complete insight into the state of circumstances on both sid=
es
is supposed.
</p>

<h4>
14. THUS A CONTINUANCE OF ACTION WILL ENSUE WHICH WILL ADVANCE TOWARDS A
CLIMAX.
</h4>

<p>
If this unbroken continuity of hostile operations really existed, the effec=
t
would be that everything would again be driven towards the extreme; for,
irrespective of the effect of such incessant activity in inflaming the
feelings, and infusing into the whole a greater degree of passion, a greate=
r
elementary force, there would also follow from this continuance of action a
stricter continuity, a closer connection between cause and effect, and thus
every single action would become of more importance, and consequently more
replete with danger.
</p>

<p>
But we know that the course of action in War has seldom or never this unbro=
ken
continuity, and that there have been many Wars in which action occupied by =
far
the smallest portion of time employed, the whole of the rest being consumed=
 in
inaction. It is impossible that this should be always an anomaly; suspensio=
n of
action in War must therefore be possible, that is no contradiction in itsel=
f.
We now proceed to show how this is.
</p>

<h4>
15. HERE, THEREFORE, THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY IS BROUGHT INTO REQUISITION.
</h4>

<p>
As we have supposed the interests of one Commander to be always antagonisti=
c to
those of the other, we have assumed a true <i>polarity</i>. We reserve a fu=
ller
explanation of this for another chapter, merely making the following
observation on it at present.
</p>

<p>
The principle of polarity is only valid when it can be conceived in one and=
 the
same thing, where the positive and its opposite the negative completely des=
troy
each other. In a battle both sides strive to conquer; that is true polarity=
,
for the victory of the one side destroys that of the other. But when we spe=
ak
of two different things which have a common relation external to themselves=
,
then it is not the things but their relations which have the polarity.
</p>

<h4>
16. ATTACK AND DEFENCE ARE THINGS DIFFERING IN KIND AND OF UNEQUAL FORCE.
POLARITY IS, THEREFORE, NOT APPLICABLE TO THEM.
</h4>

<p>
If there was only one form of War, to wit, the attack of the enemy, therefo=
re
no defence; or, in other words, if the attack was distinguished from the
defence merely by the positive motive, which the one has and the other has =
not,
but the methods of each were precisely one and the same: then in this sort =
of
fight every advantage gained on the one side would be a corresponding
disadvantage on the other, and true polarity would exist.
</p>

<p>
But action in War is divided into two forms, attack and defence, which, as =
we
shall hereafter explain more particularly, are very different and of unequa=
l
strength. Polarity therefore lies in that to which both bear a relation, in=
 the
decision, but not in the attack or defence itself.
</p>

<p>
If the one Commander wishes the solution put off, the other must wish to ha=
sten
it, but only by the same form of action. If it is A=E2=80=99s interest not =
to
attack his enemy at present, but four weeks hence, then it is B=E2=80=99s
interest to be attacked, not four weeks hence, but at the present moment. T=
his
is the direct antagonism of interests, but it by no means follows that it w=
ould
be for B=E2=80=99s interest to attack A at once. That is plainly something
totally different.
</p>

<h4>
17. THE EFFECT OF POLARITY IS OFTEN DESTROYED BY THE SUPERIORITY OF THE DEF=
ENCE
OVER THE ATTACK, AND THUS THE SUSPENSION OF ACTION IN WAR IS EXPLAINED.
</h4>

<p>
If the form of defence is stronger than that of offence, as we shall hereaf=
ter
show, the question arises, Is the advantage of a deferred decision as great=
 on
the one side as the advantage of the defensive form on the other? If it is =
not,
then it cannot by its counter-weight over-balance the latter, and thus
influence the progress of the action of the War. We see, therefore, that th=
e
impulsive force existing in the polarity of interests may be lost in the
difference between the strength of the offensive and the defensive, and the=
reby
become ineffectual.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, that side for which the present is favourable, is too weak t=
o be
able to dispense with the advantage of the defensive, he must put up with t=
he
unfavourable prospects which the future holds out; for it may still be bett=
er
to fight a defensive battle in the unpromising future than to assume the
offensive or make peace at present. Now, being convinced that the superiori=
ty
of the defensive(*) (rightly understood) is very great, and much greater th=
an
may appear at first sight, we conceive that the greater number of those per=
iods
of inaction which occur in war are thus explained without involving any
contradiction. The weaker the motives to action are, the more will those
motives be absorbed and neutralised by this difference between attack and
defence, the more frequently, therefore, will action in warfare be stopped,=
 as
indeed experience teaches.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) It must be remembered that all this antedates by some years the
introduction of long-range weapons.
</p>

<h4>
18 A SECOND GROUND CONSISTS IN THE IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
</h4>

<p>
But there is still another cause which may stop action in War, viz., an
incomplete view of the situation. Each Commander can only fully know his ow=
n
position; that of his opponent can only be known to him by reports, which a=
re
uncertain; he may, therefore, form a wrong judgment with respect to it upon
data of this description, and, in consequence of that error, he may suppose
that the power of taking the initiative rests with his adversary when it li=
es
really with himself. This want of perfect insight might certainly just as o=
ften
occasion an untimely action as untimely inaction, and hence it would in its=
elf
no more contribute to delay than to accelerate action in War. Still, it mus=
t
always be regarded as one of the natural causes which may bring action in W=
ar
to a standstill without involving a contradiction. But if we reflect how mu=
ch
more we are inclined and induced to estimate the power of our opponents too
high than too low, because it lies in human nature to do so, we shall admit
that our imperfect insight into facts in general must contribute very much =
to
delay action in War, and to modify the application of the principles pendin=
g
our conduct.
</p>

<p>
The possibility of a standstill brings into the action of War a new
modification, inasmuch as it dilutes that action with the element of time,
checks the influence or sense of danger in its course, and increases the me=
ans
of reinstating a lost balance of force. The greater the tension of feelings
from which the War springs, the greater therefore the energy with which it =
is
carried on, so much the shorter will be the periods of inaction; on the oth=
er
hand, the weaker the principle of warlike activity, the longer will be thes=
e
periods: for powerful motives increase the force of the will, and this, as =
we
know, is always a factor in the product of force.
</p>

<h4>
19. FREQUENT PERIODS OF INACTION IN WAR REMOVE IT FURTHER FROM THE ABSOLUTE=
,
AND MAKE IT STILL MORE A CALCULATION OF PROBABILITIES.
</h4>

<p>
But the slower the action proceeds in War, the more frequent and longer the
periods of inaction, so much the more easily can an error be repaired;
therefore, so much the bolder a General will be in his calculations, so muc=
h
the more readily will he keep them below the line of the absolute, and buil=
d
everything upon probabilities and conjecture. Thus, according as the course=
 of
the War is more or less slow, more or less time will be allowed for that wh=
ich
the nature of a concrete case particularly requires, calculation of probabi=
lity
based on given circumstances.
</p>

<h4>
20. THEREFORE, THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE ONLY IS WANTING TO MAKE OF WAR A GAME,=
 AND
IN THAT ELEMENT IT IS LEAST OF ALL DEFICIENT.
</h4>

<p>
We see from the foregoing how much the objective nature of War makes it a
calculation of probabilities; now there is only one single element still
wanting to make it a game, and that element it certainly is not without: it=
 is
chance. There is no human affair which stands so constantly and so generall=
y in
close connection with chance as War. But together with chance, the accident=
al,
and along with it good luck, occupy a great place in War.
</p>

<h4>
21. WAR IS A GAME BOTH OBJECTIVELY AND SUBJECTIVELY.
</h4>

<p>
If we now take a look at the <i>subjective nature</i> of War, that is to sa=
y, at those
conditions under which it is carried on, it will appear to us still more li=
ke a
game. Primarily the element in which the operations of War are carried on i=
s
danger; but which of all the moral qualities is the first in danger? <i>Cou=
rage</i>.
Now certainly courage is quite compatible with prudent calculation, but sti=
ll
they are things of quite a different kind, essentially different qualities =
of
the mind; on the other hand, daring reliance on good fortune, boldness,
rashness, are only expressions of courage, and all these propensities of th=
e
mind look for the fortuitous (or accidental), because it is their element.
</p>

<p>
We see, therefore, how, from the commencement, the absolute, the mathematic=
al
as it is called, nowhere finds any sure basis in the calculations in the Ar=
t of
War; and that from the outset there is a play of possibilities, probabiliti=
es,
good and bad luck, which spreads about with all the coarse and fine threads=
 of
its web, and makes War of all branches of human activity the most like a
gambling game.
</p>

<h4>
22. HOW THIS ACCORDS BEST WITH THE HUMAN MIND IN GENERAL.
</h4>

<p>
Although our intellect always feels itself urged towards clearness and
certainty, still our mind often feels itself attracted by uncertainty. Inst=
ead
of threading its way with the understanding along the narrow path of
philosophical investigations and logical conclusions, in order, almost
unconscious of itself, to arrive in spaces where it feels itself a stranger=
,
and where it seems to part from all well-known objects, it prefers to remai=
n
with the imagination in the realms of chance and luck. Instead of living yo=
nder
on poor necessity, it revels here in the wealth of possibilities; animated
thereby, courage then takes wings to itself, and daring and danger make the
element into which it launches itself as a fearless swimmer plunges into th=
e
stream.
</p>

<p>
Shall theory leave it here, and move on, self-satisfied with absolute
conclusions and rules? Then it is of no practical use. Theory must also tak=
e
into account the human element; it must accord a place to courage, to boldn=
ess,
even to rashness. The Art of War has to deal with living and with moral for=
ces,
the consequence of which is that it can never attain the absolute and posit=
ive.
There is therefore everywhere a margin for the accidental, and just as much=
 in
the greatest things as in the smallest. As there is room for this accidenta=
l on
the one hand, so on the other there must be courage and self-reliance in
proportion to the room available. If these qualities are forthcoming in a h=
igh
degree, the margin left may likewise be great. Courage and self-reliance ar=
e,
therefore, principles quite essential to War; consequently, theory must onl=
y
set up such rules as allow ample scope for all degrees and varieties of the=
se
necessary and noblest of military virtues. In daring there may still be wis=
dom,
and prudence as well, only they are estimated by a different standard of va=
lue.
</p>

<h4>
23. WAR IS ALWAYS A SERIOUS MEANS FOR A SERIOUS OBJECT. ITS MORE PARTICULAR
DEFINITION.
</h4>

<p>
Such is War; such the Commander who conducts it; such the theory which rule=
s
it. But War is no pastime; no mere passion for venturing and winning; no wo=
rk
of a free enthusiasm: it is a serious means for a serious object. All that
appearance which it wears from the varying hues of fortune, all that it
assimilates into itself of the oscillations of passion, of courage, of
imagination, of enthusiasm, are only particular properties of this means.
</p>

<p>
The War of a community=E2=80=94of whole Nations, and particularly of civili=
sed
Nations=E2=80=94always starts from a political condition, and is called for=
th by
a political motive. It is, therefore, a political act. Now if it was a perf=
ect,
unrestrained, and absolute expression of force, as we had to deduct it from=
 its
mere conception, then the moment it is called forth by policy it would step
into the place of policy, and as something quite independent of it would se=
t it
aside, and only follow its own laws, just as a mine at the moment of explos=
ion
cannot be guided into any other direction than that which has been given to=
 it
by preparatory arrangements. This is how the thing has really been viewed
hitherto, whenever a want of harmony between policy and the conduct of a Wa=
r
has led to theoretical distinctions of the kind. But it is not so, and the =
idea
is radically false. War in the real world, as we have already seen, is not =
an
extreme thing which expends itself at one single discharge; it is the opera=
tion
of powers which do not develop themselves completely in the same manner and=
 in
the same measure, but which at one time expand sufficiently to overcome the
resistance opposed by inertia or friction, while at another they are too we=
ak
to produce an effect; it is therefore, in a certain measure, a pulsation of
violent force more or less vehement, consequently making its discharges and
exhausting its powers more or less quickly=E2=80=94in other words, conducti=
ng
more or less quickly to the aim, but always lasting long enough to admit of
influence being exerted on it in its course, so as to give it this or that
direction, in short, to be subject to the will of a guiding intelligence., =
if
we reflect that War has its root in a political object, then naturally this
original motive which called it into existence should also continue the fir=
st
and highest consideration in its conduct. Still, the political object is no
despotic lawgiver on that account; it must accommodate itself to the nature=
 of
the means, and though changes in these means may involve modification in th=
e
political objective, the latter always retains a prior right to considerati=
on.
Policy, therefore, is interwoven with the whole action of War, and must
exercise a continuous influence upon it, as far as the nature of the forces
liberated by it will permit.
</p>

<h4>
24. WAR IS A MERE CONTINUATION OF POLICY BY OTHER MEANS.
</h4>

<p>
We see, therefore, that War is not merely a political act, but also a real
political instrument, a continuation of political commerce, a carrying out =
of
the same by other means. All beyond this which is strictly peculiar to War
relates merely to the peculiar nature of the means which it uses. That the
tendencies and views of policy shall not be incompatible with these means, =
the
Art of War in general and the Commander in each particular case may demand,=
 and
this claim is truly not a trifling one. But however powerfully this may rea=
ct
on political views in particular cases, still it must always be regarded as
only a modification of them; for the political view is the object, War is t=
he
means, and the means must always include the object in our conception.
</p>

<h4>
25. DIVERSITY IN THE NATURE OF WARS.
</h4>

<p>
The greater and the more powerful the motives of a War, the more it affects=
 the
whole existence of a people. The more violent the excitement which precedes=
 the
War, by so much the nearer will the War approach to its abstract form, so m=
uch
the more will it be directed to the destruction of the enemy, so much the
nearer will the military and political ends coincide, so much the more pure=
ly
military and less political the War appears to be; but the weaker the motiv=
es
and the tensions, so much the less will the natural direction of the milita=
ry
element=E2=80=94that is, force=E2=80=94be coincident with the direction whi=
ch the
political element indicates; so much the more must, therefore, the War beco=
me
diverted from its natural direction, the political object diverge from the =
aim
of an ideal War, and the War appear to become political.
</p>

<p>
But, that the reader may not form any false conceptions, we must here obser=
ve
that by this natural tendency of War we only mean the philosophical, the
strictly logical, and by no means the tendency of forces actually engaged i=
n
conflict, by which would be supposed to be included all the emotions and
passions of the combatants. No doubt in some cases these also might be exci=
ted
to such a degree as to be with difficulty restrained and confined to the
political road; but in most cases such a contradiction will not arise, beca=
use
by the existence of such strenuous exertions a great plan in harmony therew=
ith
would be implied. If the plan is directed only upon a small object, then th=
e
impulses of feeling amongst the masses will be also so weak that these mass=
es
will require to be stimulated rather than repressed.
</p>

<h4>
26. THEY MAY ALL BE REGARDED AS POLITICAL ACTS.
</h4>

<p>
Returning now to the main subject, although it is true that in one kind of =
War
the political element seems almost to disappear, whilst in another kind it
occupies a very prominent place, we may still affirm that the one is as
political as the other; for if we regard the State policy as the intelligen=
ce
of the personified State, then amongst all the constellations in the politi=
cal
sky whose movements it has to compute, those must be included which arise w=
hen
the nature of its relations imposes the necessity of a great War. It is onl=
y if
we understand by policy not a true appreciation of affairs in general, but =
the
conventional conception of a cautious, subtle, also dishonest craftiness,
averse from violence, that the latter kind of War may belong more to policy
than the first.
</p>

<h4>
27. INFLUENCE OF THIS VIEW ON THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF MILITARY HISTORY, =
AND
ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEORY.
</h4>

<p>
We see, therefore, in the first place, that under all circumstances War is =
to
be regarded not as an independent thing, but as a political instrument; and=
 it
is only by taking this point of view that we can avoid finding ourselves in
opposition to all military history. This is the only means of unlocking the
great book and making it intelligible. Secondly, this view shows us how War=
s
must differ in character according to the nature of the motives and
circumstances from which they proceed.
</p>

<p>
Now, the first, the grandest, and most decisive act of judgment which the
Statesman and General exercises is rightly to understand in this respect th=
e
War in which he engages, not to take it for something, or to wish to make o=
f it
something, which by the nature of its relations it is impossible for it to =
be.
This is, therefore, the first, the most comprehensive, of all strategical
questions. We shall enter into this more fully in treating of the plan of a
War.
</p>

<p>
For the present we content ourselves with having brought the subject up to =
this
point, and having thereby fixed the chief point of view from which War and =
its
theory are to be studied.
</p>

<h4>
28. RESULT FOR THEORY.
</h4>

<p>
War is, therefore, not only chameleon-like in character, because it changes=
 its
colour in some degree in each particular case, but it is also, as a whole, =
in
relation to the predominant tendencies which are in it, a wonderful trinity=
,
composed of the original violence of its elements, hatred and animosity, wh=
ich
may be looked upon as blind instinct; of the play of probabilities and chan=
ce,
which make it a free activity of the soul; and of the subordinate nature of=
 a
political instrument, by which it belongs purely to the reason.
</p>

<p>
The first of these three phases concerns more the people the second, more t=
he
General and his Army; the third, more the Government. The passions which br=
eak
forth in War must already have a latent existence in the peoples. The range
which the display of courage and talents shall get in the realm of
probabilities and of chance depends on the particular characteristics of th=
e
General and his Army, but the political objects belong to the Government al=
one.
</p>

<p>
These three tendencies, which appear like so many different law-givers, are
deeply rooted in the nature of the subject, and at the same time variable i=
n
degree. A theory which would leave any one of them out of account, or set u=
p
any arbitrary relation between them, would immediately become involved in s=
uch
a contradiction with the reality, that it might be regarded as destroyed at
once by that alone.
</p>

<p>
The problem is, therefore, that theory shall keep itself poised in a manner
between these three tendencies, as between three points of attraction.
</p>

<p>
The way in which alone this difficult problem can be solved we shall examin=
e in
the book on the =E2=80=9CTheory of War.=E2=80=9D In every case the concepti=
on of
War, as here defined, will be the first ray of light which shows us the tru=
e
foundation of theory, and which first separates the great masses and allows=
 us
to distinguish them from one another.

<h3><a name=3D"chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>Ends and Means in War</h3>

<p>
Having in the foregoing chapter ascertained the complicated and variable na=
ture
of War, we shall now occupy ourselves in examining into the influence which
this nature has upon the end and means in War.
</p>

<p>
If we ask, first of all, for the object upon which the whole effort of War =
is
to be directed, in order that it may suffice for the attainment of the
political object, we shall find that it is just as variable as are the
political object and the particular circumstances of the War.
</p>

<p>
If, in the next place, we keep once more to the pure conception of War, the=
n we
must say that the political object properly lies out of its province, for i=
f
War is an act of violence to compel the enemy to fulfil our will, then in e=
very
case all depends on our overthrowing the enemy, that is, disarming him, and=
 on
that alone. This object, developed from abstract conceptions, but which is =
also
the one aimed at in a great many cases in reality, we shall, in the first
place, examine in this reality.
</p>

<p>
In connection with the plan of a campaign we shall hereafter examine more
closely into the meaning of disarming a nation, but here we must at once dr=
aw a
distinction between three things, which, as three general objects, comprise
everything else within them. They are the <i>military power, the country</i=
>, and <i>the
will of the enemy</i>.
</p>

<p>
The military power must be destroyed, that is, reduced to such a state as n=
ot
to be able to prosecute the War. This is the sense in which we wish to be
understood hereafter, whenever we use the expression =E2=80=9Cdestruction o=
f the
enemy=E2=80=99s military power.=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
The <i>country</i> must be conquered, for out of the country a new military=
 force may
be formed.
</p>

<p>
But even when both these things are done, still the War, that is, the hosti=
le
feeling and action of hostile agencies, cannot be considered as at an end a=
s
long as the <i>will</i> of the enemy is not subdued also; that is, its Gove=
rnment and
its Allies must be forced into signing a peace, or the people into submissi=
on;
for whilst we are in full occupation of the country, the War may break out
afresh, either in the interior or through assistance given by Allies. No do=
ubt,
this may also take place after a peace, but that shows nothing more than th=
at
every War does not carry in itself the elements for a complete decision and
final settlement.
</p>

<p>
But even if this is the case, still with the conclusion of peace a number o=
f
sparks are always extinguished which would have smouldered on quietly, and =
the
excitement of the passions abates, because all those whose minds are dispos=
ed
to peace, of which in all nations and under all circumstances there is alwa=
ys a
great number, turn themselves away completely from the road to resistance.
Whatever may take place subsequently, we must always look upon the object a=
s
attained, and the business of War as ended, by a peace.
</p>

<p>
As protection of the country is the primary object for which the military f=
orce
exists, therefore the natural order is, that first of all this force should=
 be
destroyed, then the country subdued; and through the effect of these two
results, as well as the position we then hold, the enemy should be forced t=
o
make peace. Generally the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force is done =
by
degrees, and in just the same measure the conquest of the country follows
immediately. The two likewise usually react upon each other, because the lo=
ss
of provinces occasions a diminution of military force. But this order is by=
 no
means necessary, and on that account it also does not always take place. Th=
e
enemy=E2=80=99s Army, before it is sensibly weakened, may retreat to the op=
posite
side of the country, or even quite outside of it. In this case, therefore, =
the
greater part or the whole of the country is conquered.
</p>

<p>
But this object of War in the abstract, this final means of attaining the
political object in which all others are combined, the <i>disarming the ene=
my</i>, is
rarely attained in practice and is not a condition necessary to peace.
Therefore it can in no wise be set up in theory as a law. There are innumer=
able
instances of treaties in which peace has been settled before either party c=
ould
be looked upon as disarmed; indeed, even before the balance of power had
undergone any sensible alteration. Nay, further, if we look at the case in =
the
concrete, then we must say that in a whole class of cases, the idea of a
complete defeat of the enemy would be a mere imaginative flight, especially
when the enemy is considerably superior.
</p>

<p>
The reason why the object deduced from the conception of War is not adapted=
 in
general to real War lies in the difference between the two, which is discus=
sed
in the preceding chapter. If it was as pure theory gives it, then a War bet=
ween
two States of very unequal military strength would appear an absurdity;
therefore impossible. At most, the inequality between the physical forces m=
ight
be such that it could be balanced by the moral forces, and that would not g=
o
far with our present social condition in Europe. Therefore, if we have seen
Wars take place between States of very unequal power, that has been the cas=
e
because there is a wide difference between War in reality and its original
conception.
</p>

<p>
There are two considerations which as motives may practically take the plac=
e of
inability to continue the contest. The first is the improbability, the seco=
nd
is the excessive price, of success.
</p>

<p>
According to what we have seen in the foregoing chapter, War must always se=
t
itself free from the strict law of logical necessity, and seek aid from the
calculation of probabilities; and as this is so much the more the case, the
more the War has a bias that way, from the circumstances out of which it ha=
s
arisen=E2=80=94the smaller its motives are, and the excitement it has
raised=E2=80=94so it is also conceivable how out of this calculation of
probabilities even motives to peace may arise. War does not, therefore, alw=
ays
require to be fought out until one party is overthrown; and we may suppose
that, when the motives and passions are slight, a weak probability will suf=
fice
to move that side to which it is unfavourable to give way. Now, were the ot=
her
side convinced of this beforehand, it is natural that he would strive for t=
his
probability only, instead of first wasting time and effort in the attempt t=
o
achieve the total destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army.
</p>

<p>
Still more general in its influence on the resolution to peace is the
consideration of the expenditure of force already made, and further require=
d.
As War is no act of blind passion, but is dominated by the political object=
,
therefore the value of that object determines the measure of the sacrifices=
 by
which it is to be purchased. This will be the case, not only as regards ext=
ent,
but also as regards duration. As soon, therefore, as the required outlay
becomes so great that the political object is no longer equal in value, the
object must be given up, and peace will be the result.
</p>

<p>
We see, therefore, that in Wars where one side cannot completely disarm the
other, the motives to peace on both sides will rise or fall on each side
according to the probability of future success and the required outlay. If
these motives were equally strong on both sides, they would meet in the cen=
tre
of their political difference. Where they are strong on one side, they migh=
t be
weak on the other. If their amount is only sufficient, peace will follow, b=
ut
naturally to the advantage of that side which has the weakest motive for it=
s
conclusion. We purposely pass over here the difference which the <i>positiv=
e</i> and
<i>negative</i> character of the political end must necessarily produce pra=
ctically;
for although that is, as we shall hereafter show, of the highest importance=
,
still we are obliged to keep here to a more general point of view, because =
the
original political views in the course of the War change very much, and at =
last
may become totally different, <i>just because they are determined by result=
s and
probable events</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now comes the question how to influence the probability of success. In the
first place, naturally by the same means which we use when the object is th=
e
subjugation of the enemy, by the destruction of his military force and the
conquest of his provinces; but these two means are not exactly of the same
import here as they would be in reference to that object. If we attack the
enemy=E2=80=99s Army, it is a very different thing whether we intend to fol=
low up
the first blow with a succession of others, until the whole force is destro=
yed,
or whether we mean to content ourselves with a victory to shake the
enemy=E2=80=99s feeling of security, to convince him of our superiority, an=
d to
instil into him a feeling of apprehension about the future. If this is our
object, we only go so far in the destruction of his forces as is sufficient=
. In
like manner, the conquest, of the enemy=E2=80=99s provinces is quite a diff=
erent
measure if the object is not the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army. I=
n the
latter case the destruction of the Army is the real effectual action, and t=
he
taking of the provinces only a consequence of it; to take them before the A=
rmy
had been defeated would always be looked upon only as a necessary evil. On =
the
other hand, if our views are not directed upon the complete destruction of =
the
enemy=E2=80=99s force, and if we are sure that the enemy does not seek but =
fears
to bring matters to a bloody decision, the taking possession of a weak or
defenceless province is an advantage in itself, and if this advantage is of
sufficient importance to make the enemy apprehensive about the general resu=
lt,
then it may also be regarded as a shorter road to peace.
</p>

<p>
But now we come upon a peculiar means of influencing the probability of the
result without destroying the enemy=E2=80=99s Army, namely, upon the expedi=
tions
which have a direct connection with political views. If there are any
enterprises which are particularly likely to break up the enemy=E2=80=99s
alliances or make them inoperative, to gain new alliances for ourselves, to
raise political powers in our own favour, &amp;c. &amp;c., then it is easy =
to
conceive how much these may increase the probability of success, and become=
 a
shorter way towards our object than the routing of the enemy=E2=80=99s forc=
es.
</p>

<p>
The second question is how to act upon the enemy=E2=80=99s expenditure in
strength, that is, to raise the price of success.
</p>

<p>
The enemy=E2=80=99s outlay in strength lies in the <i>wear and tear</i> of =
his forces,
consequently in the <i>destruction</i> of them on our part, and in the <i>l=
oss</i> of
<i>provinces</i>, consequently the <i>conquest</i> of them by us.
</p>

<p>
Here, again, on account of the various significations of these means, so
likewise it will be found that neither of them will be identical in its
signification in all cases if the objects are different. The smallness in
general of this difference must not cause us perplexity, for in reality the
weakest motives, the finest shades of difference, often decide in favour of
this or that method of applying force. Our only business here is to show th=
at,
certain conditions being supposed, the possibility of attaining our purpose=
 in
different ways is no contradiction, absurdity, nor even error.
</p>

<p>
Besides these two means, there are three other peculiar ways of directly
increasing the waste of the enemy=E2=80=99s force. The first is <i>invasion=
</i>, that is
<i>the occupation of the enemy=E2=80=99s territory, not with a view to keep=
ing it</i>,
but in order to levy contributions upon it, or to devastate it.
</p>

<p>
The immediate object here is neither the conquest of the enemy=E2=80=99s
territory nor the defeat of his armed force, but merely to <i>do him damage=
 in a
general way</i>. The second way is to select for the object of our enterpri=
ses
those points at which we can do the enemy most harm. Nothing is easier to
conceive than two different directions in which our force may be employed, =
the
first of which is to be preferred if our object is to defeat the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
Army, while the other is more advantageous if the defeat of the enemy is ou=
t of
the question. According to the usual mode of speaking, we should say that t=
he
first is primarily military, the other more political. But if we take our v=
iew
from the highest point, both are equally military, and neither the one nor =
the
other can be eligible unless it suits the circumstances of the case. The th=
ird,
by far the most important, from the great number of cases which it embraces=
, is
the <i>wearing out</i> of the enemy. We choose this expression not only to =
explain our
meaning in few words, but because it represents the thing exactly, and is n=
ot
so figurative as may at first appear. The idea of wearing out in a struggle
amounts in practice to <i>a gradual exhaustion of the physical powers and o=
f the
will by the long continuance of exertion</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now, if we want to overcome the enemy by the duration of the contest, we mu=
st
content ourselves with as small objects as possible, for it is in the natur=
e of
the thing that a great end requires a greater expenditure of force than a s=
mall
one; but the smallest object that we can propose to ourselves is simple pas=
sive
resistance, that is a combat without any positive view. In this way, theref=
ore,
our means attain their greatest relative value, and therefore the result is
best secured. How far now can this negative mode of proceeding be carried?
Plainly not to absolute passivity, for mere endurance would not be fighting=
;
and the defensive is an activity by which so much of the enemy=E2=80=99s po=
wer
must be destroyed that he must give up his object. That alone is what we ai=
m at
in each single act, and therein consists the negative nature of our object.
</p>

<p>
No doubt this negative object in its single act is not so effective as the
positive object in the same direction would be, supposing it successful; bu=
t
there is this difference in its favour, that it succeeds more easily than t=
he
positive, and therefore it holds out greater certainty of success; what is
wanting in the efficacy of its single act must be gained through time, that=
 is,
through the duration of the contest, and therefore this negative intention,
which constitutes the principle of the pure defensive, is also the natural
means of overcoming the enemy by the duration of the combat, that is of wea=
ring
him out.
</p>

<p>
Here lies the origin of that difference of <i>Offensive</i> and <i>Defensiv=
e</i>, the
influence of which prevails throughout the whole province of War. We cannot=
 at
present pursue this subject further than to observe that from this negative
intention are to be deduced all the advantages and all the stronger forms o=
f
combat which are on the side of the <i>Defensive</i>, and in which that
philosophical-dynamic law which exists between the greatness and the certai=
nty
of success is realised. We shall resume the consideration of all this
hereafter.
</p>

<p>
If then the negative purpose, that is the concentration of all the means in=
to a
state of pure resistance, affords a superiority in the contest, and if this
advantage is sufficient to <i>balance</i> whatever superiority in numbers t=
he
adversary may have, then the mere <i>duration</i> of the contest will suffi=
ce
gradually to bring the loss of force on the part of the adversary to a poin=
t at
which the political object can no longer be an equivalent, a point at which=
,
therefore, he must give up the contest. We see then that this class of mean=
s,
the wearing out of the enemy, includes the great number of cases in which t=
he
weaker resists the stronger.
</p>

<p>
Frederick the Great, during the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, was never strong =
enough
to overthrow the Austrian monarchy; and if he had tried to do so after the
fashion of Charles the Twelfth, he would inevitably have had to succumb
himself. But after his skilful application of the system of husbanding his
resources had shown the powers allied against him, through a seven years=E2=
=80=99
struggle, that the actual expenditure of strength far exceeded what they ha=
d at
first anticipated, they made peace.
</p>

<p>
We see then that there are many ways to one=E2=80=99s object in War; that t=
he
complete subjugation of the enemy is not essential in every case; that the
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s military force, the conquest of the
enemy=E2=80=99s provinces, the mere occupation of them, the mere invasion o=
f
them=E2=80=94enterprises which are aimed directly at political
objects=E2=80=94lastly, a passive expectation of the enemy=E2=80=99s blow, =
are all
means which, each in itself, may be used to force the enemy=E2=80=99s will
according as the peculiar circumstances of the case lead us to expect more =
from
the one or the other. We could still add to these a whole category of short=
er
methods of gaining the end, which might be called arguments ad hominem. Wha=
t
branch of human affairs is there in which these sparks of individual spirit
have not made their appearance, surmounting all formal considerations? And
least of all can they fail to appear in War, where the personal character o=
f
the combatants plays such an important part, both in the cabinet and in the
field. We limit ourselves to pointing this out, as it would be pedantry to
attempt to reduce such influences into classes. Including these, we may say
that the number of possible ways of reaching the object rises to infinity.
</p>

<p>
To avoid under-estimating these different short roads to one=E2=80=99s purp=
ose,
either estimating them only as rare exceptions, or holding the difference w=
hich
they cause in the conduct of War as insignificant, we must bear in mind the
diversity of political objects which may cause a War=E2=80=94measure at a g=
lance
the distance which there is between a death struggle for political existenc=
e
and a War which a forced or tottering alliance makes a matter of disagreeab=
le
duty. Between the two innumerable gradations occur in practice. If we rejec=
t
one of these gradations in theory, we might with equal right reject the who=
le,
which would be tantamount to shutting the real world completely out of sigh=
t.
</p>

<p>
These are the circumstances in general connected with the aim which we have=
 to
pursue in War; let us now turn to the means.
</p>

<p>
There is only one single means, it is the <i>Fight</i>. However diversified=
 this may
be in form, however widely it may differ from a rough vent of hatred and
animosity in a hand-to-hand encounter, whatever number of things may introd=
uce
themselves which are not actual fighting, still it is always implied in the
conception of War that all the effects manifested have their roots in the
combat.
</p>

<p>
That this must always be so in the greatest diversity and complication of t=
he
reality is proved in a very simple manner. All that takes place in War take=
s
place through armed forces, but where the forces of War, <i>i.e.</i>, armed=
 men, are
applied, there the idea of fighting must of necessity be at the foundation.
</p>

<p>
All, therefore, that relates to forces of War=E2=80=94all that is connected=
 with
their creation, maintenance, and application=E2=80=94belongs to military
activity.
</p>

<p>
Creation and maintenance are obviously only the means, whilst application i=
s
the object.
</p>

<p>
The contest in War is not a contest of individual against individual, but a=
n
organised whole, consisting of manifold parts; in this great whole we may
distinguish units of two kinds, the one determined by the subject, the othe=
r by
the object. In an Army the mass of combatants ranges itself always into an
order of new units, which again form members of a higher order. The combat =
of
each of these members forms, therefore, also a more or less distinct unit.
Further, the motive of the fight; therefore its object forms its unit.
</p>

<p>
Now, to each of these units which we distinguish in the contest we attach t=
he
name of combat.
</p>

<p>
If the idea of combat lies at the foundation of every application of armed
power, then also the application of armed force in general is nothing more =
than
the determining and arranging a certain number of combats.
</p>

<p>
Every activity in War, therefore, necessarily relates to the combat either
directly or indirectly. The soldier is levied, clothed, armed, exercised, h=
e
sleeps, eats, drinks, and marches, all <i>merely to fight at the right time=
 and
place</i>.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, all the threads of military activity terminate in the combat=
, we
shall grasp them all when we settle the order of the combats. Only from thi=
s
order and its execution proceed the effects, never directly from the condit=
ions
preceding them. Now, in the combat all the action is directed to the
<i>destruction</i> of the enemy, or rather of <i>his fighting powers</i>, f=
or this lies in
the conception of combat. The destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s fighting p=
ower
is, therefore, always the means to attain the object of the combat.
</p>

<p>
This object may likewise be the mere destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s arm=
ed
force; but that is not by any means necessary, and it may be something quit=
e
different. Whenever, for instance, as we have shown, the defeat of the enem=
y is
not the only means to attain the political object, whenever there are other
objects which may be pursued as the aim in a War, then it follows of itself
that such other objects may become the object of particular acts of Warfare=
,
and therefore also the object of combats.
</p>

<p>
But even those combats which, as subordinate acts, are in the strict sense
devoted to the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s fighting force need not h=
ave
that destruction itself as their first object.
</p>

<p>
If we think of the manifold parts of a great armed force, of the number of
circumstances which come into activity when it is employed, then it is clea=
r
that the combat of such a force must also require a manifold organisation, =
a
subordinating of parts and formation. There may and must naturally arise fo=
r
particular parts a number of objects which are not themselves the destructi=
on
of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force, and which, while they certainly contrib=
ute to
increase that destruction, do so only in an indirect manner. If a battalion=
 is
ordered to drive the enemy from a rising ground, or a bridge, &amp;c., then
properly the occupation of any such locality is the real object, the
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force which takes place only the m=
eans
or secondary matter. If the enemy can be driven away merely by a demonstrat=
ion,
the object is attained all the same; but this hill or bridge is, in point o=
f
fact, only required as a means of increasing the gross amount of loss infli=
cted
on the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force. It is the case on the field of battle, =
much
more must it be so on the whole theatre of war, where not only one Army is
opposed to another, but one State, one Nation, one whole country to another=
.
Here the number of possible relations, and consequently possible combinatio=
ns,
is much greater, the diversity of measures increased, and by the gradation =
of
objects, each subordinate to another the first means employed is further ap=
art
from the ultimate object.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore for many reasons possible that the object of a combat is no=
t
the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, that is, of the force immedia=
tely
opposed to us, but that this only appears as a means. But in all such cases=
 it
is no longer a question of complete destruction, for the combat is here not=
hing
else but a measure of strength=E2=80=94has in itself no value except only t=
hat of
the present result, that is, of its decision.
</p>

<p>
But a measuring of strength may be effected in cases where the opposing sid=
es
are very unequal by a mere comparative estimate. In such cases no fighting =
will
take place, and the weaker will immediately give way.
</p>

<p>
If the object of a combat is not always the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
forces therein engaged=E2=80=94and if its object can often be attained as w=
ell
without the combat taking place at all, by merely making a resolve to fight=
,
and by the circumstances to which this resolution gives rise=E2=80=94then t=
hat
explains how a whole campaign may be carried on with great activity without=
 the
actual combat playing any notable part in it.
</p>

<p>
That this may be so military history proves by a hundred examples. How many=
 of
those cases can be justified, that is, without involving a contradiction an=
d
whether some of the celebrities who rose out of them would stand criticism,=
 we
shall leave undecided, for all we have to do with the matter is to show the
possibility of such a course of events in War.
</p>

<p>
We have only one means in War=E2=80=94the battle; but this means, by the in=
finite
variety of paths in which it may be applied, leads us into all the differen=
t
ways which the multiplicity of objects allows of, so that we seem to have
gained nothing; but that is not the case, for from this unity of means proc=
eeds
a thread which assists the study of the subject, as it runs through the who=
le
web of military activity and holds it together.
</p>

<p>
But we have considered the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force as one =
of the
objects which maybe pursued in War, and left undecided what relative import=
ance
should be given to it amongst other objects. In certain cases it will depen=
d on
circumstances, and as a general question we have left its value undetermine=
d.
We are once more brought back upon it, and we shall be able to get an insig=
ht
into the value which must necessarily be accorded to it.
</p>

<p>
The combat is the single activity in War; in the combat the destruction of =
the
enemy opposed to us is the means to the end; it is so even when the combat =
does
not actually take place, because in that case there lies at the root of the
decision the supposition at all events that this destruction is to be regar=
ded
as beyond doubt. It follows, therefore, that the destruction of the
enemy=E2=80=99s military force is the foundation-stone of all action in War=
, the
great support of all combinations, which rest upon it like the arch on its
abutments. All action, therefore, takes place on the supposition that if th=
e
solution by force of arms which lies at its foundation should be realised, =
it
will be a favourable one. The decision by arms is, for all operations in Wa=
r,
great and small, what cash payment is in bill transactions. However remote =
from
each other these relations, however seldom the realisation may take place,
still it can never entirely fail to occur.
</p>

<p>
If the decision by arms lies at the foundation of all combinations, then it
follows that the enemy can defeat each of them by gaining a victory on the
field, not merely in the one on which our combination directly depends, but
also in any other encounter, if it is only important enough; for every
important decision by arms=E2=80=94that is, destruction of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
forces=E2=80=94reacts upon all preceding it, because, like a liquid element=
, they
tend to bring themselves to a level.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force appears, therefore=
,
always as the superior and more effectual means, to which all others must g=
ive
way.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, only when there is a supposed equality in all other conditi=
ons
that we can ascribe to the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force t=
he
greater efficacy. It would, therefore, be a great mistake to draw the
conclusion that a blind dash must always gain the victory over skill and
caution. An unskilful attack would lead to the destruction of our own and n=
ot
of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, and therefore is not what is here meant. The
superior efficacy belongs not to the <i>means</i> but to the <i>end</i>, an=
d we are only
comparing the effect of one realised purpose with the other.
</p>

<p>
If we speak of the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force, we must
expressly point out that nothing obliges us to confine this idea to the mer=
e
physical force; on the contrary, the moral is necessarily implied as well,
because both in fact are interwoven with each other, even in the most minut=
e
details, and therefore cannot be separated. But it is just in connection wi=
th
the inevitable effect which has been referred to, of a great act of destruc=
tion
(a great victory) upon all other decisions by arms, that this moral element=
 is
most fluid, if we may use that expression, and therefore distributes itself=
 the
most easily through all the parts.
</p>

<p>
Against the far superior worth which the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s=
 armed
force has over all other means stands the expense and risk of this means, a=
nd
it is only to avoid these that any other means are taken. That these must b=
e
costly stands to reason, for the waste of our own military forces must, <i>=
ceteris
paribus</i>, always be greater the more our aim is directed upon the destru=
ction of
the enemy=E2=80=99s power.
</p>

<p>
The danger lies in this, that the greater efficacy which we seek recoils on
ourselves, and therefore has worse consequences in case we fail of success.
</p>

<p>
Other methods are, therefore, less costly when they succeed, less dangerous
when they fail; but in this is necessarily lodged the condition that they a=
re
only opposed to similar ones, that is, that the enemy acts on the same
principle; for if the enemy should choose the way of a great decision by ar=
ms,
<i>our means must on that account be changed against our will, in order to
correspond with his</i>. Then all depends on the issue of the act of destru=
ction;
but of course it is evident that, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, in this act we mu=
st be at a
disadvantage in all respects because our views and our means had been direc=
ted
in part upon other objects, which is not the case with the enemy. Two diffe=
rent
objects of which one is not part, the other exclude each other, and therefo=
re a
force which may be applicable for the one may not serve for the other. If,
therefore, one of two belligerents is determined to seek the great decision=
 by
arms, then he has a high probability of success, as soon as he is certain h=
is
opponent will not take that way, but follows a different object; and every =
one
who sets before himself any such other aim only does so in a reasonable man=
ner,
provided he acts on the supposition that his adversary has as little intent=
ion
as he has of resorting to the great decision by arms.
</p>

<p>
But what we have here said of another direction of views and forces relates
only to other <i>positive objects</i>, which we may propose to ourselves in=
 War,
besides the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, not by any means to t=
he
pure defensive, which may be adopted with a view thereby to exhaust the
enemy=E2=80=99s forces. In the pure defensive the positive object is wantin=
g, and
therefore, while on the defensive, our forces cannot at the same time be
directed on other objects; they can only be employed to defeat the intentio=
ns
of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
We have now to consider the opposite of the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
armed force, that is to say, the preservation of our own. These two efforts
always go together, as they mutually act and react on each other; they are
integral parts of one and the same view, and we have only to ascertain what
effect is produced when one or the other has the predominance. The endeavou=
r to
destroy the enemy=E2=80=99s force has a positive object, and leads to posit=
ive
results, of which the final aim is the conquest of the enemy. The preservat=
ion
of our own forces has a negative object, leads therefore to the defeat of t=
he
enemy=E2=80=99s intentions, that is to pure resistance, of which the final =
aim
can be nothing more than to prolong the duration of the contest, so that th=
e
enemy shall exhaust himself in it.
</p>

<p>
The effort with a positive object calls into existence the act of destructi=
on;
the effort with the negative object awaits it.
</p>

<p>
How far this state of expectation should and may be carried we shall enter =
into
more particularly in the theory of attack and defence, at the origin of whi=
ch
we again find ourselves. Here we shall content ourselves with saying that t=
he
awaiting must be no absolute endurance, and that in the action bound up wit=
h it
the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force engaged in this conflict=
 may
be the aim just as well as anything else. It would therefore be a great err=
or
in the fundamental idea to suppose that the consequence of the negative cou=
rse
is that we are precluded from choosing the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
military force as our object, and must prefer a bloodless solution. The
advantage which the negative effort gives may certainly lead to that, but o=
nly
at the risk of its not being the most advisable method, as that question is
dependent on totally different conditions, resting not with ourselves but w=
ith
our opponents. This other bloodless way cannot, therefore, be looked upon a=
t
all as the natural means of satisfying our great anxiety to spare our force=
s;
on the contrary, when circumstances are not favourable, it would be the mea=
ns
of completely ruining them. Very many Generals have fallen into this error,=
 and
been ruined by it. The only necessary effect resulting from the superiority=
 of
the negative effort is the delay of the decision, so that the party acting
takes refuge in that way, as it were, in the expectation of the decisive
moment. The consequence of that is generally <i>the postponement of the act=
ion</i> as
much as possible in time, and also in space, in so far as space is in
connection with it. If the moment has arrived in which this can no longer b=
e
done without ruinous disadvantage, then the advantage of the negative must =
be
considered as exhausted, and then comes forward unchanged the effort for th=
e
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, which was kept back by a counterp=
oise,
but never discarded.
</p>

<p>
We have seen, therefore, in the foregoing reflections, that there are many =
ways
to the aim, that is, to the attainment of the political object; but that th=
e
only means is the combat, and that consequently everything is subject to a
supreme law: which is the <i>decision by arms;</i> that where this is reall=
y demanded
by one, it is a redress which cannot be refused by the other; that, therefo=
re,
a belligerent who takes any other way must make sure that his opponent will=
 not
take this means of redress, or his cause may be lost in that supreme court;
hence therefore the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force, amongst=
 all
the objects which can be pursued in War, appears always as the one which
overrules all others.
</p>

<p>
What may be achieved by combinations of another kind in War we shall only l=
earn
in the sequel, and naturally only by degrees. We content ourselves here wit=
h
acknowledging in general their possibility, as something pointing to the
difference between the reality and the conception, and to the influence of
particular circumstances. But we could not avoid showing at once that the
<i>bloody solution of the crisis</i>, the effort for the destruction of the
enemy=E2=80=99s force, is the firstborn son of War. If when political objec=
ts are
unimportant, motives weak, the excitement of forces small, a cautious comma=
nder
tries in all kinds of ways, without great crises and bloody solutions, to t=
wist
himself skilfully into a peace through the characteristic weaknesses of his
enemy in the field and in the Cabinet, we have no right to find fault with =
him,
if the premises on which he acts are well founded and justified by success;
still we must require him to remember that he only travels on forbidden tra=
cks,
where the God of War may surprise him; that he ought always to keep his eye=
 on
the enemy, in order that he may not have to defend himself with a dress rap=
ier
if the enemy takes up a sharp sword.
</p>

<p>
The consequences of the nature of War, how ends and means act in it, how in=
 the
modifications of reality it deviates sometimes more, sometimes less, from i=
ts
strict original conception, fluctuating backwards and forwards, yet always
remaining under that strict conception as under a supreme law: all this we =
must
retain before us, and bear constantly in mind in the consideration of each =
of
the succeeding subjects, if we would rightly comprehend their true relation=
s
and proper importance, and not become involved incessantly in the most glar=
ing
contradictions with the reality, and at last with our own selves.

<h3><a name=3D"chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>The Genius for War</h3>

<p>
Every special calling in life, if it is to be followed with success, requir=
es
peculiar qualifications of understanding and soul. Where these are of a hig=
h
order, and manifest themselves by extraordinary achievements, the mind to w=
hich
they belong is termed GENIUS.
</p>

<p>
We know very well that this word is used in many significations which are v=
ery
different both in extent and nature, and that with many of these significat=
ions
it is a very difficult task to define the essence of Genius; but as we neit=
her
profess to be philosopher nor grammarian, we must be allowed to keep to the
meaning usual in ordinary language, and to understand by =E2=80=9Cgenius=E2=
=80=9D a
very high mental capacity for certain employments.
</p>

<p>
We wish to stop for a moment over this faculty and dignity of the mind, in
order to vindicate its title, and to explain more fully the meaning of the
conception. But we shall not dwell on that (genius) which has obtained its
title through a very great talent, on genius properly so called, that is a
conception which has no defined limits. What we have to do is to bring unde=
r
consideration every common tendency of the powers of the mind and soul towa=
rds
the business of War, the whole of which common tendencies we may look upon =
as
the ESSENCE OF MILITARY GENIUS. We say =E2=80=9Ccommon,=E2=80=9D for just t=
herein
consists military genius, that it is not one single quality bearing upon Wa=
r,
as, for instance, courage, while other qualities of mind and soul are wanti=
ng
or have a direction which is unserviceable for War, but that it is AN
HARMONIOUS ASSOCIATION OF POWERS, in which one or other may predominate, bu=
t
none must be in opposition.
</p>

<p>
If every combatant required to be more or less endowed with military genius=
,
then our armies would be very weak; for as it implies a peculiar bent of th=
e
intelligent powers, therefore it can only rarely be found where the mental
powers of a people are called into requisition and trained in many differen=
t
ways. The fewer the employments followed by a Nation, the more that of arms
predominates, so much the more prevalent will military genius also be found=
.
But this merely applies to its prevalence, by no means to its degree, for t=
hat
depends on the general state of intellectual culture in the country. If we =
look
at a wild, warlike race, then we find a warlike spirit in individuals much =
more
common than in a civilised people; for in the former almost every warrior
possesses it, whilst in the civilised whole, masses are only carried away b=
y it
from necessity, never by inclination. But amongst uncivilised people we nev=
er
find a really great General, and very seldom what we can properly call a
military genius, because that requires a development of the intelligent pow=
ers
which cannot be found in an uncivilised state. That a civilised people may =
also
have a warlike tendency and development is a matter of course; and the more
this is general, the more frequently also will military spirit be found in
individuals in their armies. Now as this coincides in such case with the hi=
gher
degree of civilisation, therefore from such nations have issued forth the m=
ost
brilliant military exploits, as the Romans and the French have exemplified.=
 The
greatest names in these and in all other nations that have been renowned in=
 War
belong strictly to epochs of higher culture.
</p>

<p>
From this we may infer how great a share the intelligent powers have in
superior military genius. We shall now look more closely into this point.
</p>

<p>
War is the province of danger, and therefore courage above all things is th=
e
first quality of a warrior.
</p>

<p>
Courage is of two kinds: first, physical courage, or courage in presence of
danger to the person; and next, moral courage, or courage before
responsibility, whether it be before the judgment-seat of external authorit=
y,
or of the inner power, the conscience. We only speak here of the first.
</p>

<p>
Courage before danger to the person, again, is of two kinds. First, it may =
be
indifference to danger, whether proceeding from the organism of the individ=
ual,
contempt of death, or habit: in any of these cases it is to be regarded as =
a
permanent condition.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, courage may proceed from positive motives, such as personal pride=
,
patriotism, enthusiasm of any kind. In this case courage is not so much a
normal condition as an impulse.
</p>

<p>
We may conceive that the two kinds act differently. The first kind is more
certain, because it has become a second nature, never forsakes the man; the
second often leads him farther. In the first there is more of firmness, in =
the
second, of boldness. The first leaves the judgment cooler, the second raise=
s
its power at times, but often bewilders it. The two combined make up the mo=
st
perfect kind of courage.
</p>

<p>
War is the province of physical exertion and suffering. In order not to be
completely overcome by them, a certain strength of body and mind is require=
d,
which, either natural or acquired, produces indifference to them. With thes=
e
qualifications, under the guidance of simply a sound understanding, a man i=
s at
once a proper instrument for War; and these are the qualifications so gener=
ally
to be met with amongst wild and half-civilised tribes. If we go further in =
the
demands which War makes on it, then we find the powers of the understanding
predominating. War is the province of uncertainty: three-fourths of those
things upon which action in War must be calculated, are hidden more or less=
 in
the clouds of great uncertainty. Here, then, above all a fine and penetrati=
ng
mind is called for, to search out the truth by the tact of its judgment.
</p>

<p>
An average intellect may, at one time, perhaps hit upon this truth by accid=
ent;
an extraordinary courage, at another, may compensate for the want of this t=
act;
but in the majority of cases the average result will always bring to light =
the
deficient understanding.
</p>

<p>
War is the province of chance. In no sphere of human activity is such a mar=
gin
to be left for this intruder, because none is so much in constant contact w=
ith
him on all sides. He increases the uncertainty of every circumstance, and
deranges the course of events.
</p>

<p>
From this uncertainty of all intelligence and suppositions, this continual
interposition of chance, the actor in War constantly finds things different
from his expectations; and this cannot fail to have an influence on his pla=
ns,
or at least on the presumptions connected with these plans. If this influen=
ce
is so great as to render the pre-determined plan completely nugatory, then,=
 as
a rule, a new one must be substituted in its place; but at the moment the
necessary data are often wanting for this, because in the course of action
circumstances press for immediate decision, and allow no time to look about=
 for
fresh data, often not enough for mature consideration.
</p>

<p>
But it more often happens that the correction of one premise, and the knowl=
edge
of chance events which have arisen, are not sufficient to overthrow our pla=
ns
completely, but only suffice to produce hesitation. Our knowledge of
circumstances has increased, but our uncertainty, instead of having diminis=
hed,
has only increased. The reason of this is, that we do not gain all our
experience at once, but by degrees; thus our determinations continue to be
assailed incessantly by fresh experience; and the mind, if we may use the
expression, must always be =E2=80=9Cunder arms.=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
Now, if it is to get safely through this perpetual conflict with the
unexpected, two qualities are indispensable: in the first place an intellec=
t
which, even in the midst of this intense obscurity, is not without some tra=
ces
of inner light, which lead to the truth, and then the courage to follow thi=
s
faint light. The first is figuratively expressed by the French phrase <i>co=
up
d=E2=80=99=C5=93il</i>. The other is <i>resolution</i>. As the battle is th=
e feature in War to
which attention was originally chiefly directed, and as time and space are
important elements in it, more particularly when cavalry with their rapid
decisions were the chief arm, the idea of rapid and correct decision relate=
d in
the first instance to the estimation of these two elements, and to denote t=
he
idea an expression was adopted which actually only points to a correct judg=
ment
by eye. Many teachers of the Art of War then gave this limited significatio=
n as
the definition of <i>coup d=E2=80=99=C5=93il</i>. But it is undeniable that=
 all able
decisions formed in the moment of action soon came to be understood by the
expression, as, for instance, the hitting upon the right point of attack,
&amp;c. It is, therefore, not only the physical, but more frequently the me=
ntal
eye which is meant in <i>coup d=E2=80=99=C5=93il</i>. Naturally, the expres=
sion, like the
thing, is always more in its place in the field of tactics: still, it must =
not
be wanting in strategy, inasmuch as in it rapid decisions are often necessa=
ry.
If we strip this conception of that which the expression has given it of th=
e
over-figurative and restricted, then it amounts simply to the rapid discove=
ry
of a truth which to the ordinary mind is either not visible at all or only
becomes so after long examination and reflection.
</p>

<p>
Resolution is an act of courage in single instances, and if it becomes a
characteristic trait, it is a habit of the mind. But here we do not mean
courage in face of bodily danger, but in face of responsibility, therefore,=
 to
a certain extent against moral danger. This has been often called <i>courag=
e
d=E2=80=99esprit</i>, on the ground that it springs from the understanding;
nevertheless, it is no act of the understanding on that account; it is an a=
ct
of feeling. Mere intelligence is still not courage, for we often see the
cleverest people devoid of resolution. The mind must, therefore, first awak=
en
the feeling of courage, and then be guided and supported by it, because in
momentary emergencies the man is swayed more by his feelings than his thoug=
hts.
</p>

<p>
We have assigned to resolution the office of removing the torments of doubt=
,
and the dangers of delay, when there are no sufficient motives for guidance=
.
Through the unscrupulous use of language which is prevalent, this term is o=
ften
applied to the mere propensity to daring, to bravery, boldness, or temerity=
.
But, when there are <i>sufficient motives</i> in the man, let them be objec=
tive or
subjective, true or false, we have no right to speak of his resolution; for=
,
when we do so, we put ourselves in his place, and we throw into the scale
doubts which did not exist with him.
</p>

<p>
Here there is no question of anything but of strength and weakness. We are =
not
pedantic enough to dispute with the use of language about this little
misapplication, our observation is only intended to remove wrong objections=
.
</p>

<p>
This resolution now, which overcomes the state of doubting, can only be cal=
led
forth by the intellect, and, in fact, by a peculiar tendency of the same. W=
e
maintain that the mere union of a superior understanding and the necessary
feelings are not sufficient to make up resolution. There are persons who
possess the keenest perception for the most difficult problems, who are als=
o
not fearful of responsibility, and yet in cases of difficulty cannot come t=
o a
resolution. Their courage and their sagacity operate independently of each
other, do not give each other a hand, and on that account do not produce
resolution as a result. The forerunner of resolution is an act of the mind
making evident the necessity of venturing, and thus influencing the will. T=
his
quite peculiar direction of the mind, which conquers every other fear in ma=
n by
the fear of wavering or doubting, is what makes up resolution in strong min=
ds;
therefore, in our opinion, men who have little intelligence can never be
resolute. They may act without hesitation under perplexing circumstances, b=
ut
then they act without reflection. Now, of course, when a man acts without
reflection he cannot be at variance with himself by doubts, and such a mode=
 of
action may now and then lead to the right point; but we say now as before, =
it
is the average result which indicates the existence of military genius. Sho=
uld
our assertion appear extraordinary to any one, because he knows many a reso=
lute
hussar officer who is no deep thinker, we must remind him that the question
here is about a peculiar direction of the mind, and not about great thinkin=
g
powers.
</p>

<p>
We believe, therefore, that resolution is indebted to a special direction o=
f
the mind for its existence, a direction which belongs to a strong head rath=
er
than to a brilliant one. In corroboration of this genealogy of resolution w=
e
may add that there have been many instances of men who have shown the great=
est
resolution in an inferior rank, and have lost it in a higher position. Whil=
e,
on the one hand, they are obliged to resolve, on the other they see the dan=
gers
of a wrong decision, and as they are surrounded with things new to them, th=
eir
understanding loses its original force, and they become only the more timid=
 the
more they become aware of the danger of the irresolution into which they ha=
ve
fallen, and the more they have formerly been in the habit of acting on the =
spur
of the moment.
</p>

<p>
From the <i>coup d=E2=80=99=C5=93il</i> and resolution we are naturally to =
speak of its
kindred quality, <i>presence of mind</i>, which in a region of the unexpect=
ed like War
must act a great part, for it is indeed nothing but a great conquest over t=
he
unexpected. As we admire presence of mind in a pithy answer to anything sai=
d
unexpectedly, so we admire it in a ready expedient on sudden danger. Neithe=
r
the answer nor the expedient need be in themselves extraordinary, if they o=
nly
hit the point; for that which as the result of mature reflection would be
nothing unusual, therefore insignificant in its impression on us, may as an
instantaneous act of the mind produce a pleasing impression. The expression
=E2=80=9Cpresence of mind=E2=80=9D certainly denotes very fitly the readine=
ss and
rapidity of the help rendered by the mind.
</p>

<p>
Whether this noble quality of a man is to be ascribed more to the peculiari=
ty
of his mind or to the equanimity of his feelings, depends on the nature of =
the
case, although neither of the two can be entirely wanting. A telling repart=
ee
bespeaks rather a ready wit, a ready expedient on sudden danger implies mor=
e
particularly a well-balanced mind.
</p>

<p>
If we take a general view of the four elements composing the atmosphere in
which War moves, of <i>danger, physical effort, uncertainty</i>, and <i>cha=
nce</i>, it is
easy to conceive that a great force of mind and understanding is requisite =
to
be able to make way with safety and success amongst such opposing elements,=
 a
force which, according to the different modifications arising out of
circumstances, we find termed by military writers and annalists as <i>energ=
y,
firmness, staunchness, strength of mind and character</i>. All these manife=
stations
of the heroic nature might be regarded as one and the same power of volitio=
n,
modified according to circumstances; but nearly related as these things are=
 to
each other, still they are not one and the same, and it is desirable for us=
 to
distinguish here a little more closely at least the action of the powers of=
 the
soul in relation to them.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, to make the conception clear, it is essential to observ=
e
that the weight, burden, resistance, or whatever it may be called, by which
that force of the soul in the General is brought to light, is only in a ver=
y
small measure the enemy=E2=80=99s activity, the enemy=E2=80=99s resistance,=
 the
enemy=E2=80=99s action directly. The enemy=E2=80=99s activity only affects =
the
General directly in the first place in relation to his person, without
disturbing his action as Commander. If the enemy, instead of two hours, res=
ists
for four, the Commander instead of two hours is four hours in danger; this =
is a
quantity which plainly diminishes the higher the rank of the Commander. Wha=
t is
it for one in the post of Commander-in-Chief? It is nothing.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, although the opposition offered by the enemy has a direct effect =
on
the Commander through the loss of means arising from prolonged resistance, =
and
the responsibility connected with that loss, and his force of will is first
tested and called forth by these anxious considerations, still we maintain =
that
this is not the heaviest burden by far which he has to bear, because he has
only himself to settle with. All the other effects of the enemy=E2=80=99s
resistance act directly upon the combatants under his command, and through =
them
react upon him.
</p>

<p>
As long as his men full of good courage fight with zeal and spirit, it is
seldom necessary for the Chief to show great energy of purpose in the pursu=
it
of his object. But as soon as difficulties arise=E2=80=94and that must alwa=
ys
happen when great results are at stake=E2=80=94then things no longer move o=
n of
themselves like a well-oiled machine, the machine itself then begins to off=
er
resistance, and to overcome this the Commander must have a great force of w=
ill.
By this resistance we must not exactly suppose disobedience and murmurs,
although these are frequent enough with particular individuals; it is the w=
hole
feeling of the dissolution of all physical and moral power, it is the
heartrending sight of the bloody sacrifice which the Commander has to conte=
nd
with in himself, and then in all others who directly or indirectly transfer=
 to
him their impressions, feelings, anxieties, and desires. As the forces in o=
ne
individual after another become prostrated, and can no longer be excited an=
d
supported by an effort of his own will, the whole inertia of the mass gradu=
ally
rests its weight on the Will of the Commander: by the spark in his breast, =
by
the light of his spirit, the spark of purpose, the light of hope, must be
kindled afresh in others: in so far only as he is equal to this, he stands
above the masses and continues to be their master; whenever that influence
ceases, and his own spirit is no longer strong enough to revive the spirit =
of
all others, the masses drawing him down with them sink into the lower regio=
n of
animal nature, which shrinks from danger and knows not shame. These are the
weights which the courage and intelligent faculties of the military Command=
er
have to overcome if he is to make his name illustrious. They increase with =
the
masses, and therefore, if the forces in question are to continue equal to t=
he
burden, they must rise in proportion to the height of the station.
</p>

<p>
Energy in action expresses the strength of the motive through which the act=
ion
is excited, let the motive have its origin in a conviction of the
understanding, or in an impulse. But the latter can hardly ever be wanting
where great force is to show itself.
</p>

<p>
Of all the noble feelings which fill the human heart in the exciting tumult=
 of
battle, none, we must admit, are so powerful and constant as the soul=E2=80=
=99s
thirst for honour and renown, which the German language treats so unfairly =
and
tends to depreciate by the unworthy associations in the words <i>Ehrgeiz</i=
> (greed of
honour) and <i>Ruhmsucht</i> (hankering after glory). No doubt it is just i=
n War that
the abuse of these proud aspirations of the soul must bring upon the human =
race
the most shocking outrages, but by their origin they are certainly to be
counted amongst the noblest feelings which belong to human nature, and in W=
ar
they are the vivifying principle which gives the enormous body a spirit.
Although other feelings may be more general in their influence, and many of
them=E2=80=94such as love of country, fanaticism, revenge, enthusiasm of ev=
ery
kind=E2=80=94may seem to stand higher, the thirst for honour and renown sti=
ll
remains indispensable. Those other feelings may rouse the great masses in
general, and excite them more powerfully, but they do not give the Leader a
desire to will more than others, which is an essential requisite in his
position if he is to make himself distinguished in it. They do not, like a
thirst for honour, make the military act specially the property of the Lead=
er,
which he strives to turn to the best account; where he ploughs with toil, s=
ows
with care, that he may reap plentifully. It is through these aspirations we
have been speaking of in Commanders, from the highest to the lowest, this s=
ort
of energy, this spirit of emulation, these incentives, that the action of
armies is chiefly animated and made successful. And now as to that which
specially concerns the head of all, we ask, Has there ever been a great
Commander destitute of the love of honour, or is such a character even
conceivable?
</p>

<p>
<i>Firmness</i> denotes the resistance of the will in relation to the force=
 of a
single blow, <i>staunchness</i> in relation to a continuance of blows. Clos=
e as is the
analogy between the two, and often as the one is used in place of the other=
,
still there is a notable difference between them which cannot be mistaken,
inasmuch as firmness against a single powerful impression may have its root=
 in
the mere strength of a feeling, but staunchness must be supported rather by=
 the
understanding, for the greater the duration of an action the more systemati=
c
deliberation is connected with it, and from this staunchness partly derives=
 its
power.
</p>

<p>
If we now turn to <i>strength of mind or soul</i>, then the first question =
is, What
are we to understand thereby?
</p>

<p>
Plainly it is not vehement expressions of feeling, nor easily excited passi=
ons,
for that would be contrary to all the usage of language, but the power of
listening to reason in the midst of the most intense excitement, in the sto=
rm
of the most violent passions. Should this power depend on strength of
understanding alone? We doubt it. The fact that there are men of the greate=
st
intellect who cannot command themselves certainly proves nothing to the
contrary, for we might say that it perhaps requires an understanding of a
powerful rather than of a comprehensive nature; but we believe we shall be
nearer the truth if we assume that the power of submitting oneself to the
control of the understanding, even in moments of the most violent excitemen=
t of
the feelings, that power which we call <i>self-command</i>, has its root in=
 the heart
itself. It is, in point of fact, another feeling, which in strong minds
balances the excited passions without destroying them; and it is only throu=
gh
this equilibrium that the mastery of the understanding is secured. This
counterpoise is nothing but a sense of the dignity of man, that noblest pri=
de,
that deeply-seated desire of the soul always to act as a being endued with
understanding and reason. We may therefore say that a strong mind is one wh=
ich
does not lose its balance even under the most violent excitement.
</p>

<p>
If we cast a glance at the variety to be observed in the human character in
respect to feeling, we find, first, some people who have very little
excitability, who are called phlegmatic or indolent.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, some very excitable, but whose feelings still never overstep cert=
ain
limits, and who are therefore known as men full of feeling, but sober-minde=
d.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, those who are very easily roused, whose feelings blaze up quickly =
and
violently like gunpowder, but do not last.
</p>

<p>
Fourthly, and lastly, those who cannot be moved by slight causes, and who
generally are not to be roused suddenly, but only gradually; but whose feel=
ings
become very powerful and are much more lasting. These are men with strong
passions, lying deep and latent.
</p>

<p>
This difference of character lies probably close on the confines of the
physical powers which move the human organism, and belongs to that amphibio=
us
organisation which we call the nervous system, which appears to be partly
material, partly spiritual. With our weak philosophy, we shall not proceed
further in this mysterious field. But it is important for us to spend a mom=
ent
over the effects which these different natures have on, action in War, and =
to
see how far a great strength of mind is to be expected from them.
</p>

<p>
Indolent men cannot easily be thrown out of their equanimity, but we cannot
certainly say there is strength of mind where there is a want of all
manifestation of power.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, it is not to be denied that such men have a certain pecul=
iar
aptitude for War, on account of their constant equanimity. They often want =
the
positive motive to action, impulse, and consequently activity, but they are=
 not
apt to throw things into disorder.
</p>

<p>
The peculiarity of the second class is that they are easily excited to act =
on
trifling grounds, but in great matters they are easily overwhelmed. Men of =
this
kind show great activity in helping an unfortunate individual, but by the
distress of a whole Nation they are only inclined to despond, not roused to
action.
</p>

<p>
Such people are not deficient in either activity or equanimity in War; but =
they
will never accomplish anything great unless a great intellectual force
furnishes the motive, and it is very seldom that a strong, independent mind=
 is
combined with such a character.
</p>

<p>
Excitable, inflammable feelings are in themselves little suited for practic=
al
life, and therefore they are not very fit for War. They have certainly the
advantage of strong impulses, but that cannot long sustain them. At the sam=
e
time, if the excitability in such men takes the direction of courage, or a
sense of honour, they may often be very useful in inferior positions in War=
,
because the action in War over which commanders in inferior positions have
control is generally of shorter duration. Here one courageous resolution, o=
ne
effervescence of the forces of the soul, will often suffice. A brave attack=
, a
soul-stirring hurrah, is the work of a few moments, whilst a brave contest =
on
the battle-field is the work of a day, and a campaign the work of a year.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the rapid movement of their feelings, it is doubly difficult for m=
en
of this description to preserve equilibrium of the mind; therefore they
frequently lose head, and that is the worst phase in their nature as respec=
ts
the conduct of War. But it would be contrary to experience to maintain that
very excitable spirits can never preserve a steady equilibrium=E2=80=94that=
 is to
say, that they cannot do so even under the strongest excitement. Why should
they not have the sentiment of self-respect, for, as a rule, they are men o=
f a
noble nature? This feeling is seldom wanting in them, but it has not time t=
o
produce an effect. After an outburst they suffer most from a feeling of inw=
ard
humiliation. If through education, self-observance, and experience of life,
they have learned, sooner or later, the means of being on their guard, so t=
hat
at the moment of powerful excitement they are conscious betimes of the
counteracting force within their own breasts, then even such men may have g=
reat
strength of mind.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, those who are difficult to move, but on that account susceptible of
very deep feelings, men who stand in the same relation to the preceding as =
red
heat to a flame, are the best adapted by means of their Titanic strength to
roll away the enormous masses by which we may figuratively represent the
difficulties which beset command in War. The effect of their feelings is li=
ke
the movement of a great body, slower, but more irresistible.
</p>

<p>
Although such men are not so likely to be suddenly surprised by their feeli=
ngs
and carried away so as to be afterwards ashamed of themselves, like the
preceding, still it would be contrary to experience to believe that they ca=
n
never lose their equanimity, or be overcome by blind passion; on the contra=
ry,
this must always happen whenever the noble pride of self-control is wanting=
, or
as often as it has not sufficient weight. We see examples of this most
frequently in men of noble minds belonging to savage nations, where the low
degree of mental cultivation favours always the dominance of the passions. =
But
even amongst the most civilised classes in civilised States, life is full o=
f
examples of this kind=E2=80=94of men carried away by the violence of their
passions, like the poacher of old chained to the stag in the forest.
</p>

<p>
We therefore say once more a strong mind is not one that is merely suscepti=
ble
of strong excitement, but one which can maintain its serenity under the mos=
t
powerful excitement, so that, in spite of the storm in the breast, the
perception and judgment can act with perfect freedom, like the needle of th=
e
compass in the storm-tossed ship.
</p>

<p>
By the term <i>strength of character</i>, or simply <i>character</i>, is de=
noted tenacity of
conviction, let it be the result of our own or of others=E2=80=99 views, an=
d
whether they are principles, opinions, momentary inspirations, or any kind =
of
emanations of the understanding; but this kind of firmness certainly cannot
manifest itself if the views themselves are subject to frequent change. Thi=
s
frequent change need not be the consequence of external influences; it may
proceed from the continuous activity of our own mind, in which case it
indicates a characteristic unsteadiness of mind. Evidently we should not sa=
y of
a man who changes his views every moment, however much the motives of chang=
e
may originate with himself, that he has character. Only those men, therefor=
e,
can be said to have this quality whose conviction is very constant, either
because it is deeply rooted and clear in itself, little liable to alteratio=
n,
or because, as in the case of indolent men, there is a want of mental activ=
ity,
and therefore a want of motives to change; or lastly, because an explicit a=
ct
of the will, derived from an imperative maxim of the understanding, refuses=
 any
change of opinion up to a certain point.
</p>

<p>
Now in War, owing to the many and powerful impressions to which the mind is
exposed, and in the uncertainty of all knowledge and of all science, more
things occur to distract a man from the road he has entered upon, to make h=
im
doubt himself and others, than in any other human activity.
</p>

<p>
The harrowing sight of danger and suffering easily leads to the feelings
gaining ascendency over the conviction of the understanding; and in the
twilight which surrounds everything a deep clear view is so difficult that =
a
change of opinion is more conceivable and more pardonable. It is, at all ti=
mes,
only conjecture or guesses at truth which we have to act upon. This is why
differences of opinion are nowhere so great as in War, and the stream of
impressions acting counter to one=E2=80=99s own convictions never ceases to=
 flow.
Even the greatest impassibility of mind is hardly proof against them, becau=
se
the impressions are powerful in their nature, and always act at the same ti=
me
upon the feelings.
</p>

<p>
When the discernment is clear and deep, none but general principles and vie=
ws
of action from a high standpoint can be the result; and on these principles=
 the
opinion in each particular case immediately under consideration lies, as it
were, at anchor. But to keep to these results of bygone reflection, in
opposition to the stream of opinions and phenomena which the present brings
with it, is just the difficulty. Between the particular case and the princi=
ple
there is often a wide space which cannot always be traversed on a visible c=
hain
of conclusions, and where a certain faith in self is necessary and a certai=
n
amount of scepticism is serviceable. Here often nothing else will help us b=
ut
an imperative maxim which, independent of reflection, at once controls it: =
that
maxim is, in all doubtful cases to adhere to the first opinion, and not to =
give
it up until a clear conviction forces us to do so. We must firmly believe i=
n
the superior authority of well-tried maxims, and under the dazzling influen=
ce
of momentary events not forget that their value is of an inferior stamp. By
this preference which in doubtful cases we give to first convictions, by
adherence to the same our actions acquire that stability and consistency wh=
ich
make up what is called character.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see how essential a well-balanced mind is to strength of
character; therefore men of strong minds generally have a great deal of
character.
</p>

<p>
Force of character leads us to a spurious variety of it=E2=80=94OBSTINACY.
</p>

<p>
It is often very difficult in concrete cases to say where the one ends and =
the
other begins; on the other hand, it does not seem difficult to determine th=
e
difference in idea.
</p>

<p>
Obstinacy is no fault of the understanding; we use the term as denoting a
resistance against our better judgment, and it would be inconsistent to cha=
rge
that to the understanding, as the understanding is the power of judgment.
Obstinacy is A FAULT OF THE FEELINGS or heart. This inflexibility of will, =
this
impatience of contradiction, have their origin only in a particular kind of
egotism, which sets above every other pleasure that of governing both self =
and
others by its own mind alone. We should call it a kind of vanity, were it n=
ot
decidedly something better. Vanity is satisfied with mere show, but obstina=
cy
rests upon the enjoyment of the thing.
</p>

<p>
We say, therefore, force of character degenerates into obstinacy whenever t=
he
resistance to opposing judgments proceeds not from better convictions or a
reliance upon a trustworthy maxim, but from a feeling of opposition. If thi=
s
definition, as we have already admitted, is of little assistance practicall=
y,
still it will prevent obstinacy from being considered merely force of chara=
cter
intensified, whilst it is something essentially different=E2=80=94something=
 which
certainly lies close to it and is cognate to it, but is at the same time so
little an intensification of it that there are very obstinate men who from =
want
of understanding have very little force of character.
</p>

<p>
Having in these high attributes of a great military Commander made ourselve=
s
acquainted with those qualities in which heart and head co-operate, we now =
come
to a speciality of military activity which perhaps may be looked upon as th=
e
most marked if it is not the most important, and which only makes a demand =
on
the power of the mind without regard to the forces of feelings. It is the
connection which exists between War and country or ground.
</p>

<p>
This connection is, in the first place, a permanent condition of War, for i=
t is
impossible to imagine our organised Armies effecting any operation otherwis=
e
than in some given space; it is, secondly, of the most decisive importance,
because it modifies, at times completely alters, the action of all forces;
thirdly, while on the one hand it often concerns the most minute features o=
f
locality, on the other it may apply to immense tracts of country.
</p>

<p>
In this manner a great peculiarity is given to the effect of this connectio=
n of
War with country and ground. If we think of other occupations of man which =
have
a relation to these objects, on horticulture, agriculture, on building hous=
es
and hydraulic works, on mining, on the chase, and forestry, they are all
confined within very limited spaces which may be soon explored with suffici=
ent
exactness. But the Commander in War must commit the business he has in hand=
 to
a corresponding space which his eye cannot survey, which the keenest zeal
cannot always explore, and with which, owing to the constant changes taking
place, he can also seldom become properly acquainted. Certainly the enemy
generally is in the same situation; still, in the first place, the difficul=
ty,
although common to both, is not the less a difficulty, and he who by talent=
 and
practice overcomes it will have a great advantage on his side; secondly, th=
is
equality of the difficulty on both sides is merely an abstract supposition
which is rarely realised in the particular case, as one of the two opponent=
s
(the defensive) usually knows much more of the locality than his adversary.
</p>

<p>
This very peculiar difficulty must be overcome by a natural mental gift of =
a
special kind which is known by the=E2=80=94too restricted=E2=80=94term of <=
i>Ortsinn</i>
sense of locality. It is the power of quickly forming a correct geometrical
idea of any portion of country, and consequently of being able to find
one=E2=80=99s place in it exactly at any time. This is plainly an act of th=
e
imagination. The perception no doubt is formed partly by means of the physi=
cal
eye, partly by the mind, which fills up what is wanting with ideas derived =
from
knowledge and experience, and out of the fragments visible to the physical =
eye
forms a whole; but that this whole should present itself vividly to the rea=
son,
should become a picture, a mentally drawn map, that this picture should be
fixed, that the details should never again separate themselves=E2=80=94all =
that
can only be effected by the mental faculty which we call imagination. If so=
me
great poet or painter should feel hurt that we require from his goddess suc=
h an
office; if he shrugs his shoulders at the notion that a sharp gamekeeper mu=
st
necessarily excel in imagination, we readily grant that we only speak here =
of
imagination in a limited sense, of its service in a really menial capacity.
But, however slight this service, still it must be the work of that natural
gift, for if that gift is wanting, it would be difficult to imagine things
plainly in all the completeness of the visible. That a good memory is a gre=
at
assistance we freely allow, but whether memory is to be considered as an
independent faculty of the mind in this case, or whether it is just that po=
wer
of imagination which here fixes these things better on the memory, we leave
undecided, as in many respects it seems difficult upon the whole to conceiv=
e
these two mental powers apart from each other.
</p>

<p>
That practice and mental acuteness have much to do with it is not to be den=
ied.
Puysegur, the celebrated Quartermaster-General of the famous Luxemburg, use=
d to
say that he had very little confidence in himself in this respect at first,
because if he had to fetch the <i>parole</i> from a distance he always lost=
 his way.
</p>

<p>
It is natural that scope for the exercise of this talent should increase al=
ong
with rank. If the hussar and rifleman in command of a patrol must know well=
 all
the highways and byways, and if for that a few marks, a few limited powers =
of
observation, are sufficient, the Chief of an Army must make himself familia=
r
with the general geographical features of a province and of a country; must
always have vividly before his eyes the direction of the roads, rivers, and
hills, without at the same time being able to dispense with the narrower
=E2=80=9Csense of locality=E2=80=9D (<i>Ortsinn</i>). No doubt, information=
 of various kinds
as to objects in general, maps, books, memoirs, and for details the assista=
nce
of his Staff, are a great help to him; but it is nevertheless certain that =
if
he has himself a talent for forming an ideal picture of a country quickly a=
nd
distinctly, it lends to his action an easier and firmer step, saves him fro=
m a
certain mental helplessness, and makes him less dependent on others.
</p>

<p>
If this talent then is to be ascribed to imagination, it is also almost the
only service which military activity requires from that erratic goddess, wh=
ose
influence is more hurtful than useful in other respects.
</p>

<p>
We think we have now passed in review those manifestations of the powers of
mind and soul which military activity requires from human nature. Everywher=
e
intellect appears as an essential co-operative force; and thus we can
understand how the work of War, although so plain and simple in its effects=
,
can never be conducted with distinguished success by people without
distinguished powers of the understanding.
</p>

<p>
When we have reached this view, then we need no longer look upon such a nat=
ural
idea as the turning an enemy=E2=80=99s position, which has been done a thou=
sand
times, and a hundred other similar conceptions, as the result of a great ef=
fort
of genius.
</p>

<p>
Certainly one is accustomed to regard the plain honest soldier as the very
opposite of the man of reflection, full of inventions and ideas, or of the
brilliant spirit shining in the ornaments of refined education of every kin=
d.
This antithesis is also by no means devoid of truth; but it does not show t=
hat
the efficiency of the soldier consists only in his courage, and that there =
is
no particular energy and capacity of the brain required in addition to make=
 a
man merely what is called a true soldier. We must again repeat that there i=
s
nothing more common than to hear of men losing their energy on being raised=
 to
a higher position, to which they do not feel themselves equal; but we must =
also
remind our readers that we are speaking of pre-eminent services, of such as
give renown in the branch of activity to which they belong. Each grade of
command in War therefore forms its own stratum of requisite capacity of fam=
e
and honour.
</p>

<p>
An immense space lies between a General=E2=80=94that is, one at the head of=
 a
whole War, or of a theatre of War=E2=80=94and his Second in Command, for th=
e
simple reason that the latter is in more immediate subordination to a super=
ior
authority and supervision, consequently is restricted to a more limited sph=
ere
of independent thought. This is why common opinion sees no room for the
exercise of high talent except in high places, and looks upon an ordinary
capacity as sufficient for all beneath: this is why people are rather incli=
ned
to look upon a subordinate General grown grey in the service, and in whom
constant discharge of routine duties has produced a decided poverty of mind=
, as
a man of failing intellect, and, with all respect for his bravery, to laugh=
 at
his simplicity. It is not our object to gain for these brave men a better
lot=E2=80=94that would contribute nothing to their efficiency, and little t=
o
their happiness; we only wish to represent things as they are, and to expos=
e
the error of believing that a mere bravo without intellect can make himself
distinguished in War.
</p>

<p>
As we consider distinguished talents requisite for those who are to attain
distinction, even in inferior positions, it naturally follows that we think
highly of those who fill with renown the place of Second in Command of an A=
rmy;
and their seeming simplicity of character as compared with a polyhistor, wi=
th
ready men of business, or with councillors of state, must not lead us astra=
y as
to the superior nature of their intellectual activity. It happens sometimes
that men import the fame gained in an inferior position into a higher one,
without in reality deserving it in the new position; and then if they are n=
ot
much employed, and therefore not much exposed to the risk of showing their =
weak
points, the judgment does not distinguish very exactly what degree of fame =
is
really due to them; and thus such men are often the occasion of too low an
estimate being formed of the characteristics required to shine in certain
situations.
</p>

<p>
For each station, from the lowest upwards, to render distinguished services=
 in
War, there must be a particular genius. But the title of genius, history an=
d
the judgment of posterity only confer, in general, on those minds which hav=
e
shone in the highest rank, that of Commanders-in-Chief. The reason is that
here, in point of fact, the demand on the reasoning and intellectual powers
generally is much greater.
</p>

<p>
To conduct a whole War, or its great acts, which we call campaigns, to a
successful termination, there must be an intimate knowledge of State policy=
 in
its higher relations. The conduct of the War and the policy of the State he=
re
coincide, and the General becomes at the same time the Statesman.
</p>

<p>
We do not give Charles XII. the name of a great genius, because he could no=
t
make the power of his sword subservient to a higher judgment and
philosophy=E2=80=94could not attain by it to a glorious object. We do not g=
ive
that title to Henry IV. (of France), because he did not live long enough to=
 set
at rest the relations of different States by his military activity, and to
occupy himself in that higher field where noble feelings and a chivalrous
disposition have less to do in mastering the enemy than in overcoming inter=
nal
dissension.
</p>

<p>
In order that the reader may appreciate all that must be comprehended and
judged of correctly at a glance by a General, we refer to the first chapter=
. We
say the General becomes a Statesman, but he must not cease to be the Genera=
l.
He takes into view all the relations of the State on the one hand; on the
other, he must know exactly what he can do with the means at his disposal.
</p>

<p>
As the diversity, and undefined limits, of all the circumstances bring a gr=
eat
number of factors into consideration in War, as the most of these factors c=
an
only be estimated according to probability, therefore, if the Chief of an A=
rmy
does not bring to bear upon them a mind with an intuitive perception of the
truth, a confusion of ideas and views must take place, in the midst of whic=
h
the judgment will become bewildered. In this sense, Buonaparte was right wh=
en
he said that many of the questions which come before a General for decision
would make problems for a mathematical calculation not unworthy of the powe=
rs
of Newton or Euler.
</p>

<p>
What is here required from the higher powers of the mind is a sense of unit=
y,
and a judgment raised to such a compass as to give the mind an extraordinar=
y
faculty of vision which in its range allays and sets aside a thousand dim
notions which an ordinary understanding could only bring to light with grea=
t
effort, and over which it would exhaust itself. But this higher activity of=
 the
mind, this glance of genius, would still not become matter of history if th=
e
qualities of temperament and character of which we have treated did not giv=
e it
their support.
</p>

<p>
Truth alone is but a weak motive of action with men, and hence there is alw=
ays
a great difference between knowing and action, between science and art. The=
 man
receives the strongest impulse to action through the feelings, and the most
powerful succour, if we may use the expression, through those faculties of
heart and mind which we have considered under the terms of resolution,
firmness, perseverance, and force of character.
</p>

<p>
If, however, this elevated condition of heart and mind in the General did n=
ot
manifest itself in the general effects resulting from it, and could only be
accepted on trust and faith, then it would rarely become matter of history.
</p>

<p>
All that becomes known of the course of events in War is usually very simpl=
e,
and has a great sameness in appearance; no one on the mere relation of such
events perceives the difficulties connected with them which had to be overc=
ome.
It is only now and again, in the memoirs of Generals or of those in their
confidence, or by reason of some special historical inquiry directed to a
particular circumstance, that a portion of the many threads composing the w=
hole
web is brought to light. The reflections, mental doubts, and conflicts whic=
h
precede the execution of great acts are purposely concealed because they af=
fect
political interests, or the recollection of them is accidentally lost becau=
se
they have been looked upon as mere scaffolding which had to be removed on t=
he
completion of the building.
</p>

<p>
If, now, in conclusion, without venturing upon a closer definition of the
higher powers of the soul, we should admit a distinction in the intelligent
faculties themselves according to the common ideas established by language,=
 and
ask ourselves what kind of mind comes closest to military genius, then a lo=
ok
at the subject as well as at experience will tell us that searching rather =
than
inventive minds, comprehensive minds rather than such as have a special ben=
t,
cool rather than fiery heads, are those to which in time of War we should
prefer to trust the welfare of our women and children, the honour and the
safety of our fatherland.

<h3><a name=3D"chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>Of Danger in War</h3>

<p>
Usually before we have learnt what danger really is, we form an idea of it
which is rather attractive than repulsive. In the intoxication of enthusias=
m,
to fall upon the enemy at the charge=E2=80=94who cares then about bullets a=
nd men
falling? To throw oneself, blinded by excitement for a moment, against cold
death, uncertain whether we or another shall escape him, and all this close=
 to
the golden gate of victory, close to the rich fruit which ambition thirsts
for=E2=80=94can this be difficult? It will not be difficult, and still less=
 will
it appear so. But such moments, which, however, are not the work of a singl=
e
pulse-beat, as is supposed, but rather like doctors=E2=80=99 draughts, must=
 be
taken diluted and spoilt by mixture with time=E2=80=94such moments, we say,=
 are
but few.
</p>

<p>
Let us accompany the novice to the battle-field. As we approach, the thunde=
r of
the cannon becoming plainer and plainer is soon followed by the howling of
shot, which attracts the attention of the inexperienced. Balls begin to str=
ike
the ground close to us, before and behind. We hasten to the hill where stan=
ds
the General and his numerous Staff. Here the close striking of the cannon b=
alls
and the bursting of shells is so frequent that the seriousness of life make=
s
itself visible through the youthful picture of imagination. Suddenly some o=
ne
known to us falls=E2=80=94a shell strikes amongst the crowd and causes some
involuntary movements=E2=80=94we begin to feel that we are no longer perfec=
tly at
ease and collected; even the bravest is at least to some degree confused. N=
ow,
a step farther into the battle which is raging before us like a scene in a
theatre, we get to the nearest General of Division; here ball follows ball,=
 and
the noise of our own guns increases the confusion. From the General of Divi=
sion
to the Brigadier. He, a man of acknowledged bravery, keeps carefully behind=
 a
rising ground, a house, or a tree=E2=80=94a sure sign of increasing danger.=
 Grape
rattles on the roofs of the houses and in the fields; cannon balls howl ove=
r
us, and plough the air in all directions, and soon there is a frequent
whistling of musket balls. A step farther towards the troops, to that sturd=
y
infantry which for hours has maintained its firmness under this heavy fire;
here the air is filled with the hissing of balls which announce their proxi=
mity
by a short sharp noise as they pass within an inch of the ear, the head, or=
 the
breast.
</p>

<p>
To add to all this, compassion strikes the beating heart with pity at the s=
ight
of the maimed and fallen. The young soldier cannot reach any of these diffe=
rent
strata of danger without feeling that the light of reason does not move her=
e in
the same medium, that it is not refracted in the same manner as in speculat=
ive
contemplation. Indeed, he must be a very extraordinary man who, under these
impressions for the first time, does not lose the power of making any
instantaneous decisions. It is true that habit soon blunts such impressions=
; in
half in hour we begin to be more or less indifferent to all that is going o=
n
around us: but an ordinary character never attains to complete coolness and=
 the
natural elasticity of mind; and so we perceive that here again ordinary
qualities will not suffice=E2=80=94a thing which gains truth, the wider the
sphere of activity which is to be filled. Enthusiastic, stoical, natural
bravery, great ambition, or also long familiarity with danger=E2=80=94much =
of all
this there must be if all the effects produced in this resistant medium are=
 not
to fall far short of that which in the student=E2=80=99s chamber may appear=
 only
the ordinary standard.
</p>

<p>
Danger in War belongs to its friction; a correct idea of its influence is
necessary for truth of perception, and therefore it is brought under notice
here.

<h3><a name=3D"chap05"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Of Bodily Exertion in War</h3>

<p>
If no one were allowed to pass an opinion on the events of War, except at a
moment when he is benumbed by frost, sinking from heat and thirst, or dying
with hunger and fatigue, we should certainly have fewer judgments correct
<i>objectively;</i> but they would be so, <i>subjectively</i>, at least; th=
at is, they would
contain in themselves the exact relation between the person giving the judg=
ment
and the object. We can perceive this by observing how modestly subdued, eve=
n
spiritless and desponding, is the opinion passed upon the results of untowa=
rd
events by those who have been eye-witnesses, but especially if they have be=
en
parties concerned. This is, according to our view, a criterion of the influ=
ence
which bodily fatigue exercises, and of the allowance to be made for it in
matters of opinion.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the many things in War for which no tariff can be fixed, bodily eff=
ort
may be specially reckoned. Provided there is no waste, it is a coefficient =
of
all the forces, and no one can tell exactly to what extent it may be carrie=
d.
But what is remarkable is, that just as only a strong arm enables the arche=
r to
stretch the bowstring to the utmost extent, so also in War it is only by me=
ans
of a great directing spirit that we can expect the full power latent in the
troops to be developed. For it is one thing if an Army, in consequence of g=
reat
misfortunes, surrounded with danger, falls all to pieces like a wall that h=
as
been thrown down, and can only find safety in the utmost exertion of its bo=
dily
strength; it is another thing entirely when a victorious Army, drawn on by
proud feelings only, is conducted at the will of its Chief. The same effort
which in the one case might at most excite our pity must in the other call
forth our admiration, because it is much more difficult to sustain.
</p>

<p>
By this comes to light for the inexperienced eye one of those things which =
put
fetters in the dark, as it were, on the action of the mind, and wear out in
secret the powers of the soul.
</p>

<p>
Although here the question is strictly only respecting the extreme effort
required by a Commander from his Army, by a leader from his followers,
therefore of the spirit to demand it and of the art of getting it, still th=
e
personal physical exertion of Generals and of the Chief Commander must not =
be
overlooked. Having brought the analysis of War conscientiously up to this
point, we could not but take account also of the weight of this small remai=
ning
residue.
</p>

<p>
We have spoken here of bodily effort, chiefly because, like danger, it belo=
ngs
to the fundamental causes of friction, and because its indefinite quantity
makes it like an elastic body, the friction of which is well known to be
difficult to calculate.
</p>

<p>
To check the abuse of these considerations, of such a survey of things whic=
h
aggravate the difficulties of War, nature has given our judgment a guide in=
 our
sensibilities, just as an individual cannot with advantage refer to his
personal deficiencies if he is insulted and ill-treated, but may well do so=
 if
he has successfully repelled the affront, or has fully revenged it, so no
Commander or Army will lessen the impression of a disgraceful defeat by
depicting the danger, the distress, the exertions, things which would immen=
sely
enhance the glory of a victory. Thus our feeling, which after all is only a
higher kind of judgment, forbids us to do what seems an act of justice to w=
hich
our judgment would be inclined.

<h3><a name=3D"chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>Information in War</h3>

<p>
By the word =E2=80=9Cinformation=E2=80=9D we denote all the knowledge which=
 we have
of the enemy and his country; therefore, in fact, the foundation of all our
ideas and actions. Let us just consider the nature of this foundation, its =
want
of trustworthiness, its changefulness, and we shall soon feel what a danger=
ous
edifice War is, how easily it may fall to pieces and bury us in its ruins. =
For
although it is a maxim in all books that we should trust only certain
information, that we must be always suspicious, that is only a miserable bo=
ok
comfort, belonging to that description of knowledge in which writers of sys=
tems
and compendiums take refuge for want of anything better to say.
</p>

<p>
Great part of the information obtained in War is contradictory, a still gre=
ater
part is false, and by far the greatest part is of a doubtful character. Wha=
t is
required of an officer is a certain power of discrimination, which only
knowledge of men and things and good judgment can give. The law of probabil=
ity
must be his guide. This is not a trifling difficulty even in respect of the
first plans, which can be formed in the chamber outside the real sphere of =
War,
but it is enormously increased when in the thick of War itself one report
follows hard upon the heels of another; it is then fortunate if these repor=
ts
in contradicting each other show a certain balance of probability, and thus
themselves call forth a scrutiny. It is much worse for the inexperienced wh=
en
accident does not render him this service, but one report supports another,
confirms it, magnifies it, finishes off the picture with fresh touches of
colour, until necessity in urgent haste forces from us a resolution which w=
ill
soon be discovered to be folly, all those reports having been lies,
exaggerations, errors, &amp;c. &amp;c. In a few words, most reports are fal=
se,
and the timidity of men acts as a multiplier of lies and untruths. As a gen=
eral
rule, every one is more inclined to lend credence to the bad than the good.
Every one is inclined to magnify the bad in some measure, and although the
alarms which are thus propagated like the waves of the sea subside into
themselves, still, like them, without any apparent cause they rise again. F=
irm
in reliance on his own better convictions, the Chief must stand like a rock
against which the sea breaks its fury in vain. The <i>r=C3=B4le</i> is not =
easy; he who is
not by nature of a buoyant disposition, or trained by experience in War, an=
d
matured in judgment, may let it be his rule to do violence to his own natur=
al
conviction by inclining from the side of fear to that of hope; only by that
means will he be able to preserve his balance. This difficulty of seeing th=
ings
correctly, which is one of the greatest sources of friction in War, makes
things appear quite different from what was expected. The impression of the
senses is stronger than the force of the ideas resulting from methodical
reflection, and this goes so far that no important undertaking was ever yet
carried out without the Commander having to subdue new doubts in himself at=
 the
time of commencing the execution of his work. Ordinary men who follow the
suggestions of others become, therefore, generally undecided on the spot; t=
hey
think that they have found circumstances different from what they had expec=
ted,
and this view gains strength by their again yielding to the suggestions of
others. But even the man who has made his own plans, when he comes to see
things with his own eyes will often think he has done wrong. Firm reliance =
on
self must make him proof against the seeming pressure of the moment; his fi=
rst
conviction will in the end prove true, when the foreground scenery which fa=
te
has pushed on to the stage of War, with its accompaniments of terrific obje=
cts,
is drawn aside and the horizon extended. This is one of the great chasms wh=
ich
separate <i>conception</i> from <i>execution</i>.

<h3><a name=3D"chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>Friction in War</h3>

<p>
As long as we have no personal knowledge of War, we cannot conceive where t=
hose
difficulties lie of which so much is said, and what that genius and those
extraordinary mental powers required in a General have really to do. All
appears so simple, all the requisite branches of knowledge appear so plain,=
 all
the combinations so unimportant, that in comparison with them the easiest
problem in higher mathematics impresses us with a certain scientific dignit=
y.
But if we have seen War, all becomes intelligible; and still, after all, it=
 is
extremely difficult to describe what it is which brings about this change, =
to
specify this invisible and completely efficient factor.
</p>

<p>
Everything is very simple in War, but the simplest thing is difficult. Thes=
e
difficulties accumulate and produce a friction which no man can imagine exa=
ctly
who has not seen War, Suppose now a traveller, who towards evening expects =
to
accomplish the two stages at the end of his day=E2=80=99s journey, four or =
five
leagues, with post-horses, on the high road=E2=80=94it is nothing. He arriv=
es now
at the last station but one, finds no horses, or very bad ones; then a hill=
y
country, bad roads; it is a dark night, and he is glad when, after a great =
deal
of trouble, he reaches the next station, and finds there some miserable
accommodation. So in War, through the influence of an infinity of petty
circumstances, which cannot properly be described on paper, things disappoi=
nt
us, and we fall short of the mark. A powerful iron will overcomes this
friction; it crushes the obstacles, but certainly the machine along with th=
em.
We shall often meet with this result. Like an obelisk towards which the
principal streets of a town converge, the strong will of a proud spirit sta=
nds
prominent and commanding in the middle of the Art of War.
</p>

<p>
Friction is the only conception which in a general way corresponds to that
which distinguishes real War from War on paper. The military machine, the A=
rmy
and all belonging to it, is in fact simple, and appears on this account eas=
y to
manage. But let us reflect that no part of it is in one piece, that it is
composed entirely of individuals, each of which keeps up its own friction i=
n
all directions. Theoretically all sounds very well: the commander of a
battalion is responsible for the execution of the order given; and as the
battalion by its discipline is glued together into one piece, and the chief
must be a man of acknowledged zeal, the beam turns on an iron pin with litt=
le
friction. But it is not so in reality, and all that is exaggerated and fals=
e in
such a conception manifests itself at once in War. The battalion always rem=
ains
composed of a number of men, of whom, if chance so wills, the most
insignificant is able to occasion delay and even irregularity. The danger w=
hich
War brings with it, the bodily exertions which it requires, augment this ev=
il
so much that they may be regarded as the greatest causes of it.
</p>

<p>
This enormous friction, which is not concentrated, as in mechanics, at a fe=
w
points, is therefore everywhere brought into contact with chance, and thus
incidents take place upon which it was impossible to calculate, their chief
origin being chance. As an instance of one such chance: the weather. Here t=
he
fog prevents the enemy from being discovered in time, a battery from firing=
 at
the right moment, a report from reaching the General; there the rain preven=
ts a
battalion from arriving at the right time, because instead of for three it =
had
to march perhaps eight hours; the cavalry from charging effectively because=
 it
is stuck fast in heavy ground.
</p>

<p>
These are only a few incidents of detail by way of elucidation, that the re=
ader
may be able to follow the author, for whole volumes might be written on the=
se
difficulties. To avoid this, and still to give a clear conception of the ho=
st
of small difficulties to be contended with in War, we might go on heaping u=
p
illustrations, if we were not afraid of being tiresome. But those who have
already comprehended us will permit us to add a few more.
</p>

<p>
Activity in War is movement in a resistant medium. Just as a man immersed i=
n
water is unable to perform with ease and regularity the most natural and
simplest movement, that of walking, so in War, with ordinary powers, one ca=
nnot
keep even the line of mediocrity. This is the reason that the correct theor=
ist
is like a swimming master, who teaches on dry land movements which are requ=
ired
in the water, which must appear grotesque and ludicrous to those who forget
about the water. This is also why theorists, who have never plunged in
themselves, or who cannot deduce any generalities from their experience, ar=
e
unpractical and even absurd, because they only teach what every one
knows=E2=80=94how to walk.
</p>

<p>
Further, every War is rich in particular facts, while at the same time each=
 is
an unexplored sea, full of rocks which the General may have a suspicion of,=
 but
which he has never seen with his eye, and round which, moreover, he must st=
eer
in the night. If a contrary wind also springs up, that is, if any great
accidental event declares itself adverse to him, then the most consummate
skill, presence of mind, and energy are required, whilst to those who only =
look
on from a distance all seems to proceed with the utmost ease. The knowledge=
 of
this friction is a chief part of that so often talked of, experience in War=
,
which is required in a good General. Certainly he is not the best General i=
n
whose mind it assumes the greatest dimensions, who is the most over-awed by=
 it
(this includes that class of over-anxious Generals, of whom there are so ma=
ny
amongst the experienced); but a General must be aware of it that he may
overcome it, where that is possible, and that he may not expect a degree of
precision in results which is impossible on account of this very friction.
Besides, it can never be learnt theoretically; and if it could, there would
still be wanting that experience of judgment which is called tact, and whic=
h is
always more necessary in a field full of innumerable small and diversified
objects than in great and decisive cases, when one=E2=80=99s own judgment m=
ay be
aided by consultation with others. Just as the man of the world, through ta=
ct
of judgment which has become habit, speaks, acts, and moves only as suits t=
he
occasion, so the officer experienced in War will always, in great and small
matters, at every pulsation of War as we may say, decide and determine suit=
ably
to the occasion. Through this experience and practice the idea comes to his
mind of itself that so and so will not suit. And thus he will not easily pl=
ace
himself in a position by which he is compromised, which, if it often occurs=
 in
War, shakes all the foundations of confidence and becomes extremely dangero=
us.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore this friction, or what is so termed here, which makes that
which appears easy in War difficult in reality. As we proceed, we shall oft=
en
meet with this subject again, and it will hereafter become plain that besid=
es
experience and a strong will, there are still many other rare qualities of =
the
mind required to make a man a consummate General.

<h3><a name=3D"chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Concluding Remarks, Book I</h3>

<p>
Those things which as elements meet together in the atmosphere of War and m=
ake
it a resistant medium for every activity we have designated under the terms
danger, bodily effort (exertion), information, and friction. In their imped=
ient
effects they may therefore be comprehended again in the collective notion o=
f a
general friction. Now is there, then, no kind of oil which is capable of
diminishing this friction? Only one, and that one is not always available a=
t
the will of the Commander or his Army. It is the habituation of an Army to =
War.
</p>

<p>
Habit gives strength to the body in great exertion, to the mind in great
danger, to the judgment against first impressions. By it a valuable
circumspection is generally gained throughout every rank, from the hussar a=
nd
rifleman up to the General of Division, which facilitates the work of the C=
hief
Commander.
</p>

<p>
As the human eye in a dark room dilates its pupil, draws in the little ligh=
t
that there is, partially distinguishes objects by degrees, and at last know=
s
them quite well, so it is in War with the experienced soldier, whilst the
novice is only met by pitch dark night.
</p>

<p>
Habituation to War no General can give his Army at once, and the camps of
man=C5=93uvre (peace exercises) furnish but a weak substitute for it, weak =
in
comparison with real experience in War, but not weak in relation to other
Armies in which the training is limited to mere mechanical exercises of
routine. So to regulate the exercises in peace time as to include some of t=
hese
causes of friction, that the judgment, circumspection, even resolution of t=
he
separate leaders may be brought into exercise, is of much greater consequen=
ce
than those believe who do not know the thing by experience. It is of immens=
e
importance that the soldier, high or low, whatever rank he has, should not =
have
to encounter in War those things which, when seen for the first time, set h=
im
in astonishment and perplexity; if he has only met with them one single tim=
e
before, even by that he is half acquainted with them. This relates even to
bodily fatigues. They should be practised less to accustom the body to them
than the mind. In War the young soldier is very apt to regard unusual fatig=
ues
as the consequence of faults, mistakes, and embarrassment in the conduct of=
 the
whole, and to become distressed and despondent as a consequence. This would=
 not
happen if he had been prepared for this beforehand by exercises in peace.
</p>

<p>
Another less comprehensive but still very important means of gaining
habituation to War in time of peace is to invite into the service officers =
of
foreign armies who have had experience in War. Peace seldom reigns over all
Europe, and never in all quarters of the world. A State which has been long=
 at
peace should, therefore, always seek to procure some officers who have done
good service at the different scenes of Warfare, or to send there some of i=
ts
own, that they may get a lesson in War.
</p>

<p>
However small the number of officers of this description may appear in
proportion to the mass, still their influence is very sensibly felt.(*) The=
ir
experience, the bent of their genius, the stamp of their character, influen=
ce
their subordinates and comrades; and besides that, if they cannot be placed=
 in
positions of superior command, they may always be regarded as men acquainte=
d
with the country, who may be questioned on many special occasions.
</p>

War in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the efficient
principle in the manifold activity which in a wide sense is called War. But
fighting is a trial of strength of the moral and physical forces by means o=
f
the latter. That the moral cannot be omitted is evident of itself, for the
condition of the mind has always the most decisive influence on the forces
employed in War.
</p>

<p>
The necessity of fighting very soon led men to special inventions to turn t=
he
advantage in it in their own favour: in consequence of these the mode of
fighting has undergone great alterations; but in whatever way it is conduct=
ed
its conception remains unaltered, and fighting is that which constitutes Wa=
r.
</p>

<p>
The inventions have been from the first weapons and equipments for the
individual combatants. These have to be provided and the use of them learnt
before the War begins. They are made suitable to the nature of the fighting=
,
consequently are ruled by it; but plainly the activity engaged in these
appliances is a different thing from the fight itself; it is only the
preparation for the combat, not the conduct of the same. That arming and
equipping are not essential to the conception of fighting is plain, because
mere wrestling is also fighting.
</p>

<p>
Fighting has determined everything appertaining to arms and equipment, and
these in turn modify the mode of fighting; there is, therefore, a reciproci=
ty
of action between the two.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the fight itself remains still an entirely special activity, =
more
particularly because it moves in an entirely special element, namely, in th=
e
element of danger.
</p>

<p>
If, then, there is anywhere a necessity for drawing a line between two
different activities, it is here; and in order to see clearly the importanc=
e of
this idea, we need only just to call to mind how often eminent personal fit=
ness
in one field has turned out nothing but the most useless pedantry in the ot=
her.
</p>

<p>
It is also in no way difficult to separate in idea the one activity from th=
e
other, if we look at the combatant forces fully armed and equipped as a giv=
en
means, the profitable use of which requires nothing more than a knowledge o=
f
their general results.
</p>

<p>
The Art of War is therefore, in its proper sense, the art of making use of =
the
given means in fighting, and we cannot give it a better name than the
=E2=80=9C<i>Conduct of War</i>.=E2=80=9D On the other hand, in a wider sens=
e all
activities which have their existence on account of War, therefore the whol=
e
creation of troops, that is levying them, arming, equipping, and exercising
them, belong to the Art of War.
</p>

<p>
To make a sound theory it is most essential to separate these two activitie=
s,
for it is easy to see that if every act of War is to begin with the prepara=
tion
of military forces, and to presuppose forces so organised as a primary
condition for conducting War, that theory will only be applicable in the fe=
w
cases to which the force available happens to be exactly suited. If, on the
other hand, we wish to have a theory which shall suit most cases, and will =
not
be wholly useless in any case, it must be founded on those means which are =
in
most general use, and in respect to these only on the actual results spring=
ing
from them.
</p>

<p>
The conduct of War is, therefore, the formation and conduct of the fighting=
. If
this fighting was a single act, there would be no necessity for any further
subdivision, but the fight is composed of a greater or less number of singl=
e
acts, complete in themselves, which we call combats, as we have shown in th=
e
first chapter of the first book, and which form new units. From this arises=
 the
totally different activities, that of the <i>formation</i> and <i>conduct</=
i> of these single
combats in themselves, and the <i>combination</i> of them with one another,=
 with a
view to the ultimate object of the War. The first is called <i>tactics</i>,=
 the other
<i>strategy</i>.
</p>

<p>
This division into tactics and strategy is now in almost general use, and e=
very
one knows tolerably well under which head to place any single fact, without
knowing very distinctly the grounds on which the classification is founded.=
 But
when such divisions are blindly adhered to in practice, they must have some
deep root. We have searched for this root, and we might say that it is just=
 the
usage of the majority which has brought us to it. On the other hand, we loo=
k
upon the arbitrary, unnatural definitions of these conceptions sought to be
established by some writers as not in accordance with the general usage of =
the
terms.
</p>

<p>
According to our classification, therefore, tactics <i>is the theory of the=
 use of
military forces in combat</i>. Strategy <i>is the theory of the use of comb=
ats for the
object of the War</i>.
</p>

<p>
The way in which the conception of a single, or independent combat, is more
closely determined, the conditions to which this unit is attached, we shall
only be able to explain clearly when we consider the combat; we must conten=
t
ourselves for the present with saying that in relation to space, therefore =
in
combats taking place at the same time, the unit reaches just as far as <i>p=
ersonal
command</i> reaches; but in regard to time, and therefore in relation to co=
mbats
which follow each other in close succession, it reaches to the moment when =
the
crisis which takes place in every combat is entirely passed.
</p>

<p>
That doubtful cases may occur, cases, for instance, in which several combat=
s
may perhaps be regarded also as a single one, will not overthrow the ground=
 of
distinction we have adopted, for the same is the case with all grounds of
distinction of real things which are differentiated by a gradually diminish=
ing
scale. There may, therefore, certainly be acts of activity in War which,
without any alteration in the point of view, may just as well be counted
strategic as tactical; for example, very extended positions resembling a ch=
ain
of posts, the preparations for the passage of a river at several points,
&amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Our classification reaches and covers only the <i>use of the military force=
</i>. But
now there are in War a number of activities which are subservient to it, an=
d
still are quite different from it; sometimes closely allied, sometimes less
near in their affinity. All these activities relate to the <i>maintenance o=
f the
military force</i>. In the same way as its creation and training precede it=
s use,
so its maintenance is always a necessary condition. But, strictly viewed, a=
ll
activities thus connected with it are always to be regarded only as
preparations for fighting; they are certainly nothing more than activities
which are very close to the action, so that they run through the hostile ac=
t
alternate in importance with the use of the forces. We have therefore a rig=
ht
to exclude them as well as the other preparatory activities from the Art of=
 War
in its restricted sense, from the conduct of War properly so called; and we=
 are
obliged to do so if we would comply with the first principle of all theory,=
 the
elimination of all heterogeneous elements. Who would include in the real
=E2=80=9Cconduct of War=E2=80=9D the whole litany of subsistence and
administration, because it is admitted to stand in constant reciprocal acti=
on
with the use of the troops, but is something essentially different from it?
</p>

<p>
We have said, in the third chapter of our first book, that as the fight or
combat is the only directly effective activity, therefore the threads of al=
l
others, as they end in it, are included in it. By this we meant to say that=
 to
all others an object was thereby appointed which, in accordance with the la=
ws
peculiar to themselves, they must seek to attain. Here we must go a little
closer into this subject.
</p>

<p>
The subjects which constitute the activities outside of the combat are of
various kinds.
</p>

<p>
The one part belongs, in one respect, to the combat itself, is identical wi=
th
it, whilst it serves in another respect for the maintenance of the military
force. The other part belongs purely to the subsistence, and has only, in
consequence of the reciprocal action, a limited influence on the combats by=
 its
results. The subjects which in one respect belong to the fighting itself ar=
e
<i>marches, camps</i>, and <i>cantonments</i>, for they suppose so many dif=
ferent situations
of troops, and where troops are supposed there the idea of the combat must
always be present.
</p>

<p>
The other subjects, which only belong to the maintenance, are <i>subsistenc=
e, care
of the sick</i>, the <i>supply and repair of arms and equipment</i>.
</p>

<p>
Marches are quite identical with the use of the troops. The act of marching=
 in
the combat, generally called manoeuvring, certainly does not necessarily
include the use of weapons, but it is so completely and necessarily combine=
d
with it that it forms an integral part of that which we call a combat. But =
the
march outside the combat is nothing but the execution of a strategic measur=
e.
By the strategic plan is settled <i>when, where, and with what forces</i> a=
 battle is
to be delivered=E2=80=94and to carry that into execution the march is the o=
nly
means.
</p>

<p>
The march outside of the combat is therefore an instrument of strategy, but=
 not
on that account exclusively a subject of strategy, for as the armed force w=
hich
executes it may be involved in a possible combat at any moment, therefore i=
ts
execution stands also under tactical as well as strategic rules. If we
prescribe to a column its route on a particular side of a river or of a bra=
nch
of a mountain, then that is a strategic measure, for it contains the intent=
ion
of fighting on that particular side of the hill or river in preference to t=
he
other, in case a combat should be necessary during the march.
</p>

<p>
But if a column, instead of following the road through a valley, marches al=
ong
the parallel ridge of heights, or for the convenience of marching divides
itself into several columns, then these are tactical arrangements, for they
relate to the manner in which we shall use the troops in the anticipated
combat.
</p>

<p>
The particular order of march is in constant relation with readiness for
combat, is therefore tactical in its nature, for it is nothing more than th=
e
first or preliminary disposition for the battle which may possibly take pla=
ce.
</p>

<p>
As the march is the instrument by which strategy apportions its active
elements, the combats, but these last often only appear by their results an=
d
not in the details of their real course, it could not fail to happen that i=
n
theory the instrument has often been substituted for the efficient principl=
e.
Thus we hear of a decisive skilful march, allusion being thereby made to th=
ose
combat-combinations to which these marches led. This substitution of ideas =
is
too natural and conciseness of expression too desirable to call for alterat=
ion,
but still it is only a condensed chain of ideas in regard to which we must
never omit to bear in mind the full meaning, if we would avoid falling into
error.
</p>

<p>
We fall into an error of this description if we attribute to strategical
combinations a power independent of tactical results. We read of marches an=
d
man=C5=93uvres combined, the object attained, and at the same time not a wo=
rd about
combat, from which the conclusion is drawn that there are means in War of
conquering an enemy without fighting. The prolific nature of this error we
cannot show until hereafter.
</p>

<p>
But although a march can be regarded absolutely as an integral part of the
combat, still there are in it certain relations which do not belong to the
combat, and therefore are neither tactical nor strategic. To these belong a=
ll
arrangements which concern only the accommodation of the troops, the
construction of bridges, roads, &amp;c. These are only conditions; under ma=
ny
circumstances they are in very close connection, and may almost identify
themselves with the troops, as in building a bridge in presence of the enem=
y;
but in themselves they are always activities, the theory of which does not =
form
part of the theory of the conduct of War.
</p>

<p>
Camps, by which we mean every disposition of troops in concentrated, theref=
ore
in battle order, in contradistinction to cantonments or quarters, are a sta=
te
of rest, therefore of restoration; but they are at the same time also the
strategic appointment of a battle on the spot, chosen; and by the manner in
which they are taken up they contain the fundamental lines of the battle, a
condition from which every defensive battle starts; they are therefore
essential parts of both strategy and tactics.
</p>

<p>
Cantonments take the place of camps for the better refreshment of the troop=
s.
They are therefore, like camps, strategic subjects as regards position and
extent; tactical subjects as regards internal organisation, with a view to
readiness to fight.
</p>

<p>
The occupation of camps and cantonments no doubt usually combines with the
recuperation of the troops another object also, for example, the covering a
district of country, the holding a position; but it can very well be only t=
he
first. We remind our readers that strategy may follow a great diversity of
objects, for everything which appears an advantage may be the object of a
combat, and the preservation of the instrument with which War is made must
necessarily very often become the object of its partial combinations.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, in such a case strategy ministers only to the maintenance of=
 the
troops, we are not on that account out of the field of strategy, for we are
still engaged with the use of the military force, because every disposition=
 of
that force upon any point Whatever of the theatre of War is such a use.
</p>

<p>
But if the maintenance of the troops in camp or quarters calls forth activi=
ties
which are no employment of the armed force, such as the construction of hut=
s,
pitching of tents, subsistence and sanitary services in camps or quarters, =
then
such belong neither to strategy nor tactics.
</p>

<p>
Even entrenchments, the site and preparation of which are plainly part of t=
he
order of battle, therefore tactical subjects, do not belong to the theory o=
f
the conduct of War so far as respects the <i>execution of their constructio=
n</i> the
knowledge and skill required for such work being, in point of fact, qualiti=
es
inherent in the nature of an organised Army; the theory of the combat takes
them for granted.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the subjects which belong to the mere keeping up of an armed force,
because none of the parts are identified with the combat, the victualling o=
f
the troops themselves comes first, as it must be done almost daily and for =
each
individual. Thus it is that it completely permeates military action in the
parts constituting strategy=E2=80=94we say parts constituting strategy, bec=
ause
during a battle the subsistence of troops will rarely have any influence in
modifying the plan, although the thing is conceivable enough. The care for =
the
subsistence of the troops comes therefore into reciprocal action chiefly wi=
th
strategy, and there is nothing more common than for the leading strategic
features of a campaign and War to be traced out in connection with a view t=
o
this supply. But however frequent and however important these views of supp=
ly
may be, the subsistence of the troops always remains a completely different
activity from the use of the troops, and the former has only an influence o=
n
the latter by its results.
</p>

<p>
The other branches of administrative activity which we have mentioned stand
much farther apart from the use of the troops. The care of sick and wounded=
,
highly important as it is for the good of an Army, directly affects it only=
 in
a small portion of the individuals composing it, and therefore has only a w=
eak
and indirect influence upon the use of the rest. The completing and replaci=
ng
articles of arms and equipment, except so far as by the organism of the for=
ces
it constitutes a continuous activity inherent in them=E2=80=94takes place o=
nly
periodically, and therefore seldom affects strategic plans.
</p>

<p>
We must, however, here guard ourselves against a mistake. In certain cases
these subjects may be really of decisive importance. The distance of hospit=
als
and dep=C3=B4ts of munitions may very easily be imagined as the sole cause =
of very
important strategic decisions. We do not wish either to contest that point =
or
to throw it into the shade. But we are at present occupied not with the
particular facts of a concrete case, but with abstract theory; and our
assertion therefore is that such an influence is too rare to give the theor=
y of
sanitary measures and the supply of munitions and arms an importance in the=
ory
of the conduct of War such as to make it worth while to include in the theo=
ry
of the conduct of War the consideration of the different ways and systems w=
hich
the above theories may furnish, in the same way as is certainly necessary i=
n
regard to victualling troops.
</p>

<p>
If we have clearly understood the results of our reflections, then the
activities belonging to War divide themselves into two principal classes, i=
nto
such as are only =E2=80=9C<i>preparations for War</i>=E2=80=9D and into the=
 =E2=80=9C<i>War
itself.</i>=E2=80=9D This division must therefore also be made in theory.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge and applications of skill in the preparations for War are eng=
aged
in the creation, discipline, and maintenance of all the military forces; wh=
at
general names should be given to them we do not enter into, but we see that
artillery, fortification, elementary tactics, as they are called, the whole
organisation and administration of the various armed forces, and all such
things are included. But the theory of War itself occupies itself with the =
use
of these prepared means for the object of the war. It needs of the first on=
ly
the results, that is, the knowledge of the principal properties of the mean=
s
taken in hand for use. This we call =E2=80=9CThe Art of War=E2=80=9D in a l=
imited
sense, or =E2=80=9CTheory of the Conduct of War,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CTheor=
y of the
Employment of Armed Forces,=E2=80=9D all of them denoting for us the same t=
hing.
</p>

<p>
The present theory will therefore treat the combat as the real contest,
marches, camps, and cantonments as circumstances which are more or less
identical with it. The subsistence of the troops will only come into
consideration like <i>other given circumstances</i> in respect of its resul=
ts, not as
an activity belonging to the combat.
</p>

<p>
The Art of War thus viewed in its limited sense divides itself again into
tactics and strategy. The former occupies itself with the form of the separ=
ate
combat, the latter with its use. Both connect themselves with the circumsta=
nces
of marches, camps, cantonments only through the combat, and these circumsta=
nces
are tactical or strategic according as they relate to the form or to the
signification of the battle.
</p>

<p>
No doubt there will be many readers who will consider superfluous this care=
ful
separation of two things lying so close together as tactics and strategy,
because it has no direct effect on the conduct itself of War. We admit,
certainly that it would be pedantry to look for direct effects on the field=
 of
battle from a theoretical distinction.
</p>

<p>
But the first business of every theory is to clear up conceptions and ideas
which have been jumbled together, and, we may say, entangled and confused; =
and
only when a right understanding is established, as to names and conceptions=
,
can we hope to progress with clearness and facility, and be certain that au=
thor
and reader will always see things from the same point of view. Tactics and
strategy are two activities mutually permeating each other in time and spac=
e,
at the same time essentially different activities, the inner laws and mutua=
l
relations of which cannot be intelligible at all to the mind until a clear
conception of the nature of each activity is established.
</p>

<p>
He to whom all this is nothing, must either repudiate all theoretical
consideration, <i>or his understanding has not as yet been pained</i> by th=
e confused
and perplexing ideas resting on no fixed point of view, leading to no
satisfactory result, sometimes dull, sometimes fantastic, sometimes floatin=
g in
vague generalities, which we are often obliged to hear and read on the cond=
uct
of War, owing to the spirit of scientific investigation having hitherto bee=
n
little directed to these subjects.

<h3><a name=3D"chap10"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>On the Theory of War</h3>

<h4>
1. THE FIRST CONCEPTION OF THE =E2=80=9CART OF WAR=E2=80=9D WAS MERELY THE
PREPARATION OF THE ARMED FORCES.
</h4>

<p>
Formerly by the term =E2=80=9CArt of War,=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CScience of W=
ar,=E2=80=9D
nothing was understood but the totality of those branches of knowledge and
those appliances of skill occupied with material things. The pattern and
preparation and the mode of using arms, the construction of fortifications =
and
entrenchments, the organism of an army and the mechanism of its movements, =
were
the subject; these branches of knowledge and skill above referred to, and t=
he
end and aim of them all was the establishment of an armed force fit for use=
 in
War. All this concerned merely things belonging to the material world and a
one-sided activity only, and it was in fact nothing but an activity advanci=
ng
by gradations from the lower occupations to a finer kind of mechanical art.=
 The
relation of all this to War itself was very much the same as the relation o=
f
the art of the sword cutler to the art of using the sword. The employment i=
n
the moment of danger and in a state of constant reciprocal action of the
particular energies of mind and spirit in the direction proposed to them wa=
s
not yet even mooted.
</p>

<h4>
2. TRUE WAR FIRST APPEARS IN THE ART OF SIEGES.
</h4>

<p>
In the art of sieges we first perceive a certain degree of guidance of the
combat, something of the action of the intellectual faculties upon the mate=
rial
forces placed under their control, but generally only so far that it very s=
oon
embodied itself again in new material forms, such as approaches, trenches,
counter-approaches, batteries, &amp;c., and every step which this action of=
 the
higher faculties took was marked by some such result; it was only the threa=
d
that was required on which to string these material inventions in order. As=
 the
intellect can hardly manifest itself in this kind of War, except in such
things, so therefore nearly all that was necessary was done in that way.
</p>

<h4>
3. THEN TACTICS TRIED TO FIND ITS WAY IN THE SAME DIRECTION.
</h4>

<p>
Afterwards tactics attempted to give to the mechanism of its joints the
character of a general disposition, built upon the peculiar properties of t=
he
instrument, which character leads indeed to the battle-field, but instead o=
f
leading to the free activity of mind, leads to an Army made like an automat=
on
by its rigid formations and orders of battle, which, movable only by the wo=
rd
of command, is intended to unwind its activities like a piece of clockwork.
</p>

<h4>
4. THE REAL CONDUCT OF WAR ONLY MADE ITS APPEARANCE INCIDENTALLY AND INCOGN=
ITO.
</h4>

<p>
The conduct of War properly so called, that is, a use of the prepared means
adapted to the most special requirements, was not considered as any suitabl=
e
subject for theory, but one which should be left to natural talents alone. =
By
degrees, as War passed from the hand-to-hand encounters of the middle ages =
into
a more regular and systematic form, stray reflections on this point also fo=
rced
themselves into men=E2=80=99s minds, but they mostly appeared only incident=
ally
in memoirs and narratives, and in a certain measure incognito.
</p>

<h4>
5. REFLECTIONS ON MILITARY EVENTS BROUGHT ABOUT THE WANT OF A THEORY.
</h4>

<p>
As contemplation on War continually increased, and its history every day
assumed more of a critical character, the urgent want appeared of the suppo=
rt
of fixed maxims and rules, in order that in the controversies naturally ari=
sing
about military events the war of opinions might be brought to some one poin=
t.
This whirl of opinions, which neither revolved on any central pivot nor
according to any appreciable laws, could not but be very distasteful to
people=E2=80=99s minds.
</p>

<h4>
6. ENDEAVOURS TO ESTABLISH A POSITIVE THEORY.
</h4>

<p>
There arose, therefore, an endeavour to establish maxims, rules, and even
systems for the conduct of War. By this the attainment of a positive object=
 was
proposed, without taking into view the endless difficulties which the condu=
ct
of War presents in that respect. The conduct of War, as we have shown, has =
no
definite limits in any direction, while every system has the circumscribing
nature of a synthesis, from which results an irreconcileable opposition bet=
ween
such a theory and practice.
</p>

<h4>
7. LIMITATION TO MATERIAL OBJECTS.
</h4>

<p>
Writers on theory felt the difficulty of the subject soon enough, and thoug=
ht
themselves entitled to get rid of it by directing their maxims and systems =
only
upon material things and a one-sided activity. Their aim was to reach resul=
ts,
as in the science for the preparation for War, entirely certain and positiv=
e,
and therefore only to take into consideration that which could be made matt=
er
of calculation.
</p>

<h4>
8. SUPERIORITY OF NUMBERS.
</h4>

<p>
The superiority in numbers being a material condition, it was chosen from
amongst all the factors required to produce victory, because it could be
brought under mathematical laws through combinations of time and space. It =
was
thought possible to leave out of sight all other circumstances, by supposin=
g
them to be equal on each side, and therefore to neutralise one another. Thi=
s
would have been very well if it had been done to gain a preliminary knowled=
ge
of this one factor, according to its relations, but to make it a rule for e=
ver
to consider superiority of numbers as the sole law; to see the whole secret=
 of
the Art of War in the formula, <i>in a certain time, at a certain point, to=
 bring
up superior masses</i>=E2=80=94was a restriction overruled by the force of =
realities.
</p>

<h4>
9. VICTUALLING OF TROOPS.
</h4>

<p>
By one theoretical school an attempt was made to systematise another materi=
al
element also, by making the subsistence of troops, according to a previousl=
y
established organism of the Army, the supreme legislator in the higher cond=
uct
of War. In this way certainly they arrived at definite figures, but at figu=
res
which rested on a number of arbitrary calculations, and which therefore cou=
ld
not stand the test of practical application.
</p>

<h4>
10. BASE.
</h4>

<p>
An ingenious author tried to concentrate in a single conception, that of a
BASE, a whole host of objects amongst which sundry relations even with
immaterial forces found their way in as well. The list comprised the
subsistence of the troops, the keeping them complete in numbers and equipme=
nt,
the security of communications with the home country, lastly, the security =
of
retreat in case it became necessary; and, first of all, he proposed to
substitute this conception of a base for all these things; then for the bas=
e
itself to substitute its own length (extent); and, last of all, to substitu=
te
the angle formed by the army with this base: all this was done to obtain a =
pure
geometrical result utterly useless. This last is, in fact, unavoidable, if =
we
reflect that none of these substitutions could be made without violating tr=
uth
and leaving out some of the things contained in the original conception. Th=
e
idea of a base is a real necessity for strategy, and to have conceived it i=
s
meritorious; but to make such a use of it as we have depicted is completely
inadmissible, and could not but lead to partial conclusions which have forc=
ed
these theorists into a direction opposed to common sense, namely, to a beli=
ef
in the decisive effect of the enveloping form of attack.
</p>

<h4>
11. INTERIOR LINES.
</h4>

<p>
As a reaction against this false direction, another geometrical principle, =
that
of the so-called interior lines, was then elevated to the throne. Although =
this
principle rests on a sound foundation, on the truth that the combat is the =
only
effectual means in War, still it is, just on account of its purely geometri=
cal
nature, nothing but another case of one-sided theory which can never gain
ascendency in the real world.
</p>

<h4>
12. ALL THESE ATTEMPTS ARE OPEN TO OBJECTION.
</h4>

<p>
All these attempts at theory are only to be considered in their analytical =
part
as progress in the province of truth, but in their synthetical part, in the=
ir
precepts and rules, they are quite unserviceable.
</p>

<p>
They strive after determinate quantities, whilst in War all is undetermined=
,
and the calculation has always to be made with varying quantities.
</p>

<p>
They direct the attention only upon material forces, while the whole milita=
ry
action is penetrated throughout by intelligent forces and their effects.
</p>

<p>
They only pay regard to activity on one side, whilst War is a constant stat=
e of
reciprocal action, the effects of which are mutual.
</p>

<h4>
13. AS A RULE THEY EXCLUDE GENIUS.
</h4>

<p>
All that was not attainable by such miserable philosophy, the offspring of
partial views, lay outside the precincts of science=E2=80=94and was the fie=
ld of
genius, which RAISES ITSELF ABOVE RULES.
</p>

<p>
Pity the warrior who is contented to crawl about in this beggardom of rules=
,
which are too bad for genius, over which it can set itself superior, over w=
hich
it can perchance make merry! What genius does must be the best of all rules=
,
and theory cannot do better than to show how and why it is so.
</p>

<p>
Pity the theory which sets itself in opposition to the mind! It cannot repa=
ir
this contradiction by any humility, and the humbler it is so much the soone=
r
will ridicule and contempt drive it out of real life.
</p>

<h4>
14. THE DIFFICULTY OF THEORY AS SOON AS MORAL QUANTITIES COME INTO
CONSIDERATION.
</h4>

<p>
Every theory becomes infinitely more difficult from the moment that it touc=
hes
on the province of moral quantities. Architecture and painting know quite w=
ell
what they are about as long as they have only to do with matter; there is n=
o
dispute about mechanical or optical construction. But as soon as the moral
activities begin their work, as soon as moral impressions and feelings are
produced, the whole set of rules dissolves into vague ideas.
</p>

<p>
The science of medicine is chiefly engaged with bodily phenomena only; its
business is with the animal organism, which, liable to perpetual change, is
never exactly the same for two moments. This makes its practice very diffic=
ult,
and places the judgment of the physician above his science; but how much mo=
re
difficult is the case if a moral effect is added, and how much higher must =
we
place the physician of the mind?
</p>

<h4>
15. THE MORAL QUANTITIES MUST NOT BE EXCLUDED IN WAR.
</h4>

<p>
But now the activity in War is never directed solely against matter; it is
always at the same time directed against the intelligent force which gives =
life
to this matter, and to separate the two from each other is impossible.
</p>

<p>
But the intelligent forces are only visible to the inner eye, and this is
different in each person, and often different in the same person at differe=
nt
times.
</p>

<p>
As danger is the general element in which everything moves in War, it is al=
so
chiefly by courage, the feeling of one=E2=80=99s own power, that the judgme=
nt is
differently influenced. It is to a certain extent the crystalline lens thro=
ugh
which all appearances pass before reaching the understanding.
</p>

<p>
And yet we cannot doubt that these things acquire a certain objective value
simply through experience.
</p>

<p>
Every one knows the moral effect of a surprise, of an attack in flank or re=
ar.
Every one thinks less of the enemy=E2=80=99s courage as soon as he turns hi=
s
back, and ventures much more in pursuit than when pursued. Every one judges=
 of
the enemy=E2=80=99s General by his reputed talents, by his age and experien=
ce,
and shapes his course accordingly. Every one casts a scrutinising glance at=
 the
spirit and feeling of his own and the enemy=E2=80=99s troops. All these and
similar effects in the province of the moral nature of man have established
themselves by experience, are perpetually recurring, and therefore warrant =
our
reckoning them as real quantities of their kind. What could we do with any
theory which should leave them out of consideration?
</p>

<p>
Certainly experience is an indispensable title for these truths. With
psychological and philosophical sophistries no theory, no General, should
meddle.
</p>

<h4>
16. PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY OF A THEORY FOR THE CONDUCT OF WAR.
</h4>

<p>
In order to comprehend clearly the difficulty of the proposition which is
contained in a theory for the conduct of War, and thence to deduce the
necessary characteristics of such a theory, we must take a closer view of t=
he
chief particulars which make up the nature of activity in War.
</p>

<h4>
17. FIRST SPECIALITY.=E2=80=94MORAL FORCES AND THEIR EFFECTS. (HOSTILE FEEL=
ING.)
</h4>

<p>
The first of these specialities consists in the moral forces and effects.
</p>

<p>
The combat is, in its origin, the expression of <i>hostile feeling</i>, but=
 in our
great combats, which we call Wars, the hostile feeling frequently resolves
itself into merely a hostile <i>view</i>, and there is usually no innate ho=
stile
feeling residing in individual against individual. Nevertheless, the combat
never passes off without such feelings being brought into activity. Nationa=
l
hatred, which is seldom wanting in our Wars, is a substitute for personal
hostility in the breast of individual opposed to individual. But where this
also is wanting, and at first no animosity of feeling subsists, a hostile
feeling is kindled by the combat itself; for an act of violence which any o=
ne
commits upon us by order of his superior, will excite in us a desire to
retaliate and be revenged on him, sooner than on the superior power at whos=
e
command the act was done. This is human, or animal if we will; still it is =
so.
We are very apt to regard the combat in theory as an abstract trial of
strength, without any participation on the part of the feelings, and that i=
s
one of the thousand errors which theorists deliberately commit, because the=
y do
not see its consequences.
</p>

<p>
Besides that excitation of feelings naturally arising from the combat itsel=
f,
there are others also which do not essentially belong to it, but which, on
account of their relationship, easily unite with it=E2=80=94ambition, love =
of
power, enthusiasm of every kind, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<h4>
18. THE IMPRESSIONS OF DANGER. (COURAGE.)
</h4>

<p>
Finally, the combat begets the element of danger, in which all the activiti=
es
of War must live and move, like the bird in the air or the fish in the wate=
r.
But the influences of danger all pass into the feelings, either
directly=E2=80=94that is, instinctively=E2=80=94or through the medium of th=
e
understanding. The effect in the first case would be a desire to escape fro=
m
the danger, and, if that cannot be done, fright and anxiety. If this effect
does not take place, then it is <i>courage</i>, which is a counterpoise to =
that
instinct. Courage is, however, by no means an act of the understanding, but
likewise a feeling, like fear; the latter looks to the physical preservatio=
n,
courage to the moral preservation. Courage, then, is a nobler instinct. But
because it is so, it will not allow itself to be used as a lifeless instrum=
ent,
which produces its effects exactly according to prescribed measure. Courage=
 is
therefore no mere counterpoise to danger in order to neutralise the latter =
in
its effects, but a peculiar power in itself.
</p>

<h4>
19. EXTENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF DANGER.
</h4>

<p>
But to estimate exactly the influence of danger upon the principal actors i=
n
War, we must not limit its sphere to the physical danger of the moment. It
dominates over the actor, not only by threatening him, but also by threaten=
ing
all entrusted to him, not only at the moment in which it is actually presen=
t,
but also through the imagination at all other moments, which have a connect=
ion
with the present; lastly, not only directly by itself, but also indirectly =
by
the responsibility which makes it bear with tenfold weight on the mind of t=
he
chief actor. Who could advise, or resolve upon a great battle, without feel=
ing
his mind more or less wrought up, or perplexed by, the danger and
responsibility which such a great act of decision carries in itself? We may=
 say
that action in War, in so far as it is real action, not a mere condition, i=
s
never out of the sphere of danger.
</p>

<h4>
20. OTHER POWERS OF FEELING.
</h4>

<p>
If we look upon these affections which are excited by hostility and danger =
as
peculiarly belonging to War, we do not, therefore, exclude from it all othe=
rs
accompanying man in his life=E2=80=99s journey. They will also find room he=
re
frequently enough. Certainly we may say that many a petty action of the
passions is silenced in this serious business of life; but that holds good =
only
in respect to those acting in a lower sphere, who, hurried on from one stat=
e of
danger and exertion to another, lose sight of the rest of the things of lif=
e,
<i>become unused to deceit</i>, because it is of no avail with death, and s=
o attain to
that soldierly simplicity of character which has always been the best
representative of the military profession. In higher regions it is otherwis=
e,
for the higher a man=E2=80=99s rank, the more he must look around him; then=
 arise
interests on every side, and a manifold activity of the passions of good an=
d
bad. Envy and generosity, pride and humility, fierceness and tenderness, al=
l
may appear as active powers in this great drama.
</p>

<h4>
21. PECULIARITY OF MIND.
</h4>

<p>
The peculiar characteristics of mind in the chief actor have, as well as th=
ose
of the feelings, a high importance. From an imaginative, flighty, inexperie=
nced
head, and from a calm, sagacious understanding, different things are to be
expected.
</p>

<h4>
22. FROM THE DIVERSITY IN MENTAL INDIVIDUALITIES ARISES THE DIVERSITY OF WA=
YS
LEADING TO THE END.
</h4>

<p>
It is this great diversity in mental individuality, the influence of which =
is
to be supposed as chiefly felt in the higher ranks, because it increases as=
 we
progress upwards, which chiefly produces the diversity of ways leading to t=
he
end noticed by us in the first book, and which gives, to the play of
probabilities and chance, such an unequal share in determining the course o=
f
events.
</p>

<h4>
23. SECOND PECULIARITY.=E2=80=94LIVING REACTION.
</h4>

<p>
The second peculiarity in War is the living reaction, and the reciprocal ac=
tion
resulting therefrom. We do not here speak of the difficulty of estimating t=
hat
reaction, for that is included in the difficulty before mentioned, of treat=
ing
the moral powers as quantities; but of this, that reciprocal action, by its
nature, opposes anything like a regular plan. The effect which any measure
produces upon the enemy is the most distinct of all the data which action
affords; but every theory must keep to classes (or groups) of phenomena, an=
d
can never take up the really individual case in itself: that must everywher=
e be
left to judgment and talent. It is therefore natural that in a business suc=
h as
War, which in its plan=E2=80=94built upon general circumstances=E2=80=94is =
so often
thwarted by unexpected and singular accidents, more must generally be left =
to
talent; and less use can be made of a <i>theoretical guide</i> than in any =
other.
</p>

<h4>
24. THIRD PECULIARITY.=E2=80=94UNCERTAINTY OF ALL DATA.
</h4>

<p>
Lastly, the great uncertainty of all data in War is a peculiar difficulty,
because all action must, to a certain extent, be planned in a mere twilight=
,
which in addition not unfrequently=E2=80=94like the effect of a fog or
moonshine=E2=80=94gives to things exaggerated dimensions and an unnatural
appearance.
</p>

<p>
What this feeble light leaves indistinct to the sight talent must discover,=
 or
must be left to chance. It is therefore again talent, or the favour of fort=
une,
on which reliance must be placed, for want of objective knowledge.
</p>

<h4>
25. POSITIVE THEORY IS IMPOSSIBLE.
</h4>

<p>
With materials of this kind we can only say to ourselves that it is a sheer
impossibility to construct for the Art of War a theory which, like a
scaffolding, shall ensure to the chief actor an external support on all sid=
es.
In all those cases in which he is thrown upon his talent he would find hims=
elf
away from this scaffolding of theory and in opposition to it, and, however
many-sided it might be framed, the same result would ensue of which we spok=
e
when we said that talent and genius act beyond the law, and theory is in
opposition to reality.
</p>

<h4>
26. MEANS LEFT BY WHICH A THEORY IS POSSIBLE (THE DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT
EVERYWHERE EQUALLY GREAT).
</h4>

<p>
Two means present themselves of getting out of this difficulty. In the firs=
t
place, what we have said of the nature of military action in general does n=
ot
apply in the same manner to the action of every one, whatever may be his
standing. In the lower ranks the spirit of self-sacrifice is called more in=
to
request, but the difficulties which the understanding and judgment meet wit=
h
are infinitely less. The field of occurrences is more confined. Ends and me=
ans
are fewer in number. Data more distinct; mostly also contained in the actua=
lly
visible. But the higher we ascend the more the difficulties increase, until=
 in
the Commander-in-Chief they reach their climax, so that with him almost
everything must be left to genius.
</p>

<p>
Further, according to a division of the subject in <i>agreement with its na=
ture</i>,
the difficulties are not everywhere the same, but diminish the more results
manifest themselves in the material world, and increase the more they pass =
into
the moral, and become motives which influence the will. Therefore it is eas=
ier
to determine, by theoretical rules, the order and conduct of a battle, than=
 the
use to be made of the battle itself. Yonder physical weapons clash with eac=
h
other, and although mind is not wanting therein, matter must have its right=
s.
But in the effects to be produced by battles when the material results beco=
me
motives, we have only to do with the moral nature. In a word, it is easier =
to
make a theory for <i>tactics</i> than for <i>strategy</i>.
</p>

<h4>
27. THEORY MUST BE OF THE NATURE OF OBSERVATIONS NOT OF DOCTRINE.
</h4>

<p>
The second opening for the possibility of a theory lies in the point of vie=
w
that it does not necessarily require to be a <i>direction</i> for action. A=
s a general
rule, whenever an <i>activity</i> is for the most part occupied with the sa=
me objects
over and over again, with the same ends and means, although there may be
trifling alterations and a corresponding number of varieties of combination=
,
such things are capable of becoming a subject of study for the reasoning
faculties. But such study is just the most essential part of every <i>theor=
y</i>, and
has a peculiar title to that name. It is an analytical investigation of the
subject that leads to an exact knowledge; and if brought to bear on the res=
ults
of experience, which in our case would be military history, to a thorough
familiarity with it. The nearer theory attains the latter object, so much t=
he
more it passes over from the objective form of knowledge into the subjectiv=
e
one of skill in action; and so much the more, therefore, it will prove itse=
lf
effective when circumstances allow of no other decision but that of persona=
l
talents; it will show its effects in that talent itself. If theory investig=
ates
the subjects which constitute War; if it separates more distinctly that whi=
ch
at first sight seems amalgamated; if it explains fully the properties of th=
e
means; if it shows their probable effects; if it makes evident the nature o=
f
objects; if it brings to bear all over the field of War the light of
essentially critical investigation=E2=80=94then it has fulfilled the chief =
duties
of its province. It becomes then a guide to him who wishes to make himself
acquainted with War from books; it lights up the whole road for him,
facilitates his progress, educates his judgment, and shields him from error=
.
</p>

<p>
If a man of expertness spends half his life in the endeavour to clear up an
obscure subject thoroughly, he will probably know more about it than a pers=
on
who seeks to master it in a short time. Theory is instituted that each pers=
on
in succession may not have to go through the same labour of clearing the gr=
ound
and toiling through his subject, but may find the thing in order, and light
admitted on it. It should educate the mind of the future leader in War, or
rather guide him in his self-instruction, but not accompany him to the fiel=
d of
battle; just as a sensible tutor forms and enlightens the opening mind of a
youth without, therefore, keeping him in leading strings all through his li=
fe.
</p>

<p>
If maxims and rules result of themselves from the considerations which theo=
ry
institutes, if the truth accretes itself into that form of crystal, then th=
eory
will not oppose this natural law of the mind; it will rather, if the arch e=
nds
in such a keystone, bring it prominently out; but so does this, only in ord=
er
to satisfy the philosophical law of reason, in order to show distinctly the
point to which the lines all converge, not in order to form out of it an
algebraical formula for use upon the battle-field; for even these maxims an=
d
rules serve more to determine in the reflecting mind the leading outline of=
 its
habitual movements than as landmarks indicating to it the way in the act of
execution.
</p>

<h4>
28. BY THIS POINT OF VIEW THEORY BECOMES POSSIBLE, AND CEASES TO BE IN
CONTRADICTION TO PRACTICE.
</h4>

<p>
Taking this point of view, there is a possibility afforded of a satisfactor=
y,
that is, of a useful, theory of the conduct of War, never coming into
opposition with the reality, and it will only depend on rational treatment =
to
bring it so far into harmony with action that between theory and practice t=
here
shall no longer be that absurd difference which an unreasonable theory, in
defiance of common sense, has often produced, but which, just as often,
narrow-mindedness and ignorance have used as a pretext for giving way to th=
eir
natural incapacity.
</p>

<h4>
29. THEORY THEREFORE CONSIDERS THE NATURE OF ENDS AND MEANS=E2=80=94ENDS AN=
D
MEANS IN TACTICS.
</h4>

<p>
Theory has therefore to consider the nature of the means and ends.
</p>

<p>
In tactics the means are the disciplined armed forces which are to carry on=
 the
contest. The object is victory. The precise definition of this conception c=
an
be better explained hereafter in the consideration of the combat. Here we
content ourselves by denoting the retirement of the enemy from the field of
battle as the sign of victory. By means of this victory strategy gains the
object for which it appointed the combat, and which constitutes its special
signification. This signification has certainly some influence on the natur=
e of
the victory. A victory which is intended to weaken the enemy=E2=80=99s arme=
d
forces is a different thing from one which is designed only to put us in
possession of a position. The signification of a combat may therefore have =
a
sensible influence on the preparation and conduct of it, consequently will =
be
also a subject of consideration in tactics.
</p>

<h4>
30. CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND THE APPLICATION OF THE MEANS.
</h4>

<p>
As there are certain circumstances which attend the combat throughout, and =
have
more or less influence upon its result, therefore these must be taken into
consideration in the application of the armed forces.
</p>

<p>
These circumstances are the locality of the combat (ground), the time of da=
y,
and the weather.
</p>

<h4>
31. LOCALITY.
</h4>

<p>
The locality, which we prefer leaving for solution, under the head of
=E2=80=9CCountry and Ground,=E2=80=9D might, strictly speaking, be without =
any
influence at all if the combat took place on a completely level and
uncultivated plain.
</p>

<p>
In a country of steppes such a case may occur, but in the cultivated countr=
ies
of Europe it is almost an imaginary idea. Therefore a combat between civili=
sed
nations, in which country and ground have no influence, is hardly conceivab=
le.
</p>

<h4>
32. TIME OF DAY.
</h4>

<p>
The time of day influences the combat by the difference between day and nig=
ht;
but the influence naturally extends further than merely to the limits of th=
ese
divisions, as every combat has a certain duration, and great battles last f=
or
several hours. In the preparations for a great battle, it makes an essentia=
l
difference whether it begins in the morning or the evening. At the same tim=
e,
certainly many battles may be fought in which the question of the time of d=
ay
is quite immaterial, and in the generality of cases its influence is only
trifling.
</p>

<h4>
33. WEATHER.
</h4>

<p>
Still more rarely has the weather any decisive influence, and it is mostly =
only
by fogs that it plays a part.
</p>

<h4>
34. END AND MEANS IN STRATEGY.
</h4>

<p>
Strategy has in the first instance only the victory, that is, the tactical
result, as a means to its object, and ultimately those things which lead
directly to peace. The application of its means to this object is at the sa=
me
time attended by circumstances which have an influence thereon more or less=
.
</p>

<h4>
35. CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTEND THE APPLICATION OF THE MEANS OF STRATEGY.
</h4>

<p>
These circumstances are country and ground, the former including the territ=
ory
and inhabitants of the whole theatre of war; next the time of the day, and =
the
time of the year as well; lastly, the weather, particularly any unusual sta=
te
of the same, severe frost, &amp;c.
</p>

<h4>
36. THESE FORM NEW MEANS.
</h4>

<p>
By bringing these things into combination with the results of a combat,
strategy gives this result=E2=80=94and therefore the combat=E2=80=94a speci=
al
signification, places before it a particular object. But when this object i=
s
not that which leads directly to peace, therefore a subordinate one, it is =
only
to be looked upon as a means; and therefore in strategy we may look upon th=
e
results of combats or victories, in all their different significations, as
means. The conquest of a position is such a result of a combat applied to
ground. But not only are the different combats with special objects to be
considered as means, but also every higher aim which we may have in view in=
 the
combination of battles directed on a common object is to be regarded as a
means. A winter campaign is a combination of this kind applied to the seaso=
n.
</p>

<p>
There remain, therefore, as objects, only those things which may be suppose=
d as
leading <i>directly</i> to peace, Theory investigates all these ends and me=
ans
according to the nature of their effects and their mutual relations.
</p>

<h4>
37. STRATEGY DEDUCES ONLY FROM EXPERIENCE THE ENDS AND MEANS TO BE EXAMINED=
.
</h4>

<p>
The first question is, How does strategy arrive at a complete list of these
things? If there is to be a philosophical inquiry leading to an absolute
result, it would become entangled in all those difficulties which the logic=
al
necessity of the conduct of War and its theory exclude. It therefore turns =
to
experience, and directs its attention on those combinations which military
history can furnish. In this manner, no doubt, nothing more than a limited
theory can be obtained, which only suits circumstances such as are presente=
d in
history. But this incompleteness is unavoidable, because in any case theory
must either have deduced from, or have compared with, history what it advan=
ces
with respect to things. Besides, this incompleteness in every case is more
theoretical than real.
</p>

<p>
One great advantage of this method is that theory cannot lose itself in
abstruse disquisitions, subtleties, and chimeras, but must always remain
practical.
</p>

<h4>
38. HOW FAR THE ANALYSIS OF THE MEANS SHOULD BE CARRIED.
</h4>

<p>
Another question is, How far should theory go in its analysis of the means?
Evidently only so far as the elements in a separate form present themselves=
 for
consideration in practice. The range and effect of different weapons is ver=
y
important to tactics; their construction, although these effects result fro=
m
it, is a matter of indifference; for the conduct of War is not making powde=
r
and cannon out of a given quantity of charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre, of
copper and tin: the given quantities for the conduct of War are arms in a
finished state and their effects. Strategy makes use of maps without troubl=
ing
itself about triangulations; it does not inquire how the country is subdivi=
ded
into departments and provinces, and how the people are educated and governe=
d,
in order to attain the best military results; but it takes things as it fin=
ds
them in the community of European States, and observes where very different
conditions have a notable influence on War.
</p>

<h4>
39. GREAT SIMPLIFICATION OF THE KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED.
</h4>

<p>
That in this manner the number of subjects for theory is much simplified, a=
nd
the knowledge requisite for the conduct of War much reduced, is easy to
perceive. The very great mass of knowledge and appliances of skill which
minister to the action of War in general, and which are necessary before an
army fully equipped can take the field, unite in a few great results before
they are able to reach, in actual War, the final goal of their activity; ju=
st
as the streams of a country unite themselves in rivers before they fall int=
o
the sea. Only those activities emptying themselves directly into the sea of=
 War
have to be studied by him who is to conduct its operations.
</p>

<h4>
40. THIS EXPLAINS THE RAPID GROWTH OF GREAT GENERALS, AND WHY A GENERAL IS =
NOT
A MAN OF LEARNING.
</h4>

<p>
This result of our considerations is in fact so necessary, any other would =
have
made us distrustful of their accuracy. Only thus is explained how so often =
men
have made their appearance with great success in War, and indeed in the hig=
her
ranks even in supreme Command, whose pursuits had been previously of a tota=
lly
different nature; indeed how, as a rule, the most distinguished Generals ha=
ve
never risen from the very learned or really erudite class of officers, but =
have
been mostly men who, from the circumstances of their position, could not ha=
ve
attained to any great amount of knowledge. On that account those who have
considered it necessary or even beneficial to commence the education of a
future General by instruction in all details have always been ridiculed as
absurd pedants. It would be easy to show the injurious tendency of such a
course, because the human mind is trained by the knowledge imparted to it a=
nd
the direction given to its ideas. Only what is great can make it great; the
little can only make it little, if the mind itself does not reject it as
something repugnant.
</p>

<h4>
41. FORMER CONTRADICTIONS.
</h4>

<p>
Because this simplicity of knowledge requisite in War was not attended to, =
but
that knowledge was always jumbled up with the whole impedimenta of subordin=
ate
sciences and arts, therefore the palpable opposition to the events of real =
life
which resulted could not be solved otherwise than by ascribing it all to
genius, which requires no theory and for which no theory could be prescribe=
d.
</p>

<h4>
42. ON THIS ACCOUNT ALL USE OF KNOWLEDGE WAS DENIED, AND EVERYTHING ASCRIBE=
D TO
NATURAL TALENTS.
</h4>

<p>
People with whom common sense had the upper hand felt sensible of the immen=
se
distance remaining to be filled up between a genius of the highest order an=
d a
learned pedant; and they became in a manner free-thinkers, rejected all bel=
ief
in theory, and affirmed the conduct of War to be a natural function of man,
which he performs more or less well according as he has brought with him in=
to
the world more or less talent in that direction. It cannot be denied that t=
hese
were nearer to the truth than those who placed a value on false knowledge: =
at
the same time it may easily be seen that such a view is itself but an
exaggeration. No activity of the human understanding is possible without a
certain stock of ideas; but these are, for the greater part at least, not
innate but acquired, and constitute his knowledge. The only question theref=
ore
is, of what kind should these ideas be; and we think we have answered it if=
 we
say that they should be directed on those things which man has directly to =
deal
with in War.
</p>

<h4>
43. THE KNOWLEDGE MUST BE MADE SUITABLE TO THE POSITION.
</h4>

<p>
Inside this field itself of military activity, the knowledge required must =
be
different according to the station of the Commander. It will be directed on
smaller and more circumscribed objects if he holds an inferior, upon greate=
r
and more comprehensive ones if he holds a higher situation. There are Field
Marshals who would not have shone at the head of a cavalry regiment, and <i=
>vice
versa</i>.
</p>

<h4>
44. THE KNOWLEDGE IN WAR IS VERY SIMPLE, BUT NOT, AT THE SAME TIME, VERY EA=
SY.
</h4>

<p>
But although the knowledge in War is simple, that is to say directed to so =
few
subjects, and taking up those only in their final results, the art of execu=
tion
is not, on that account, easy. Of the difficulties to which activity in War=
 is
subject generally, we have already spoken in the first book; we here omit t=
hose
things which can only be overcome by courage, and maintain also that the
activity of mind, is only simple, and easy in inferior stations, but increa=
ses
in difficulty with increase of rank, and in the highest position, in that o=
f
Commander-in-Chief, is to be reckoned among the most difficult which there =
is
for the human mind.
</p>

<h4>
45. OF THE NATURE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE.
</h4>

<p>
The Commander of an Army neither requires to be a learned explorer of histo=
ry
nor a publicist, but he must be well versed in the higher affairs of State;=
 he
must know, and be able to judge correctly of traditional tendencies, intere=
sts
at stake, the immediate questions at issue, and the characters of leading
persons; he need not be a close observer of men, a sharp dissector of human
character, but he must know the character, the feelings, the habits, the
peculiar faults and inclinations of those whom he is to command. He need no=
t
understand anything about the make of a carriage, or the harness of a batte=
ry
horse, but he must know how to calculate exactly the march of a column, und=
er
different circumstances, according to the time it requires. These are matte=
rs
the knowledge of which cannot be forced out by an apparatus of scientific
formula and machinery: they are only to be gained by the exercise of an
accurate judgment in the observation of things and of men, aided by a speci=
al
talent for the apprehension of both.
</p>

<p>
The necessary knowledge for a high position in military action is therefore
distinguished by this, that by observation, therefore by study and reflecti=
on,
it is only to be attained through a special talent which as an intellectual
instinct understands how to extract from the phenomena of life only the ess=
ence
or spirit, as bees do the honey from the flowers; and that it is also to be
gained by experience of life as well as by study and reflection. Life will
never bring forth a Newton or an Euler by its rich teachings, but it may br=
ing
forth great calculators in War, such as Cond=C3=A9 or Frederick.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore not necessary that, in order to vindicate the intellectual
dignity of military activity, we should resort to untruth and silly pedantr=
y.
There never has been a great and distinguished Commander of contracted mind=
,
but very numerous are the instances of men who, after serving with the grea=
test
distinction in inferior positions, remained below mediocrity in the highest=
,
from insufficiency of intellectual capacity. That even amongst those holdin=
g
the post of Commander-in-Chief there may be a difference according to the
degree of their plenitude of power is a matter of course.
</p>

<h4>
46. SCIENCE MUST BECOME ART.
</h4>

<p>
Now we have yet to consider one condition which is more necessary for the
knowledge of the conduct of War than for any other, which is, that it must =
pass
completely into the mind and almost completely cease to be something object=
ive.
In almost all other arts and occupations of life the active agent can make =
use
of truths which he has only learnt once, and in the spirit and sense of whi=
ch
he no longer lives, and which he extracts from dusty books. Even truths whi=
ch
he has in hand and uses daily may continue something external to himself, I=
f
the architect takes up a pen to settle the strength of a pier by a complica=
ted
calculation, the truth found as a result is no emanation from his own mind.=
 He
had first to find the data with labour, and then to submit these to an
operation of the mind, the rule for which he did not discover, the necessit=
y of
which he is perhaps at the moment only partly conscious of, but which he
applies, for the most part, as if by mechanical dexterity. But it is never =
so
in War. The moral reaction, the ever-changeful form of things, makes it
necessary for the chief actor to carry in himself the whole mental apparatu=
s of
his knowledge, that anywhere and at every pulse-beat he may be capable of
giving the requisite decision from himself. Knowledge must, by this complet=
e
assimilation with his own mind and life, be converted into real power. This=
 is
the reason why everything seems so easy with men distinguished in War, and =
why
everything is ascribed to natural talent. We say natural talent, in order
thereby to distinguish it from that which is formed and matured by observat=
ion
and study.
</p>

<p>
We think that by these reflections we have explained the problem of a theor=
y of
the conduct of War; and pointed out the way to its solution.
</p>

<p>
Of the two fields into which we have divided the conduct of War, tactics an=
d
strategy, the theory of the latter contains unquestionably, as before obser=
ved,
the greatest difficulties, because the first is almost limited to a
circumscribed field of objects, but the latter, in the direction of objects
leading directly to peace, opens to itself an unlimited field of possibilit=
ies.
Since for the most part the Commander-in-Chief has only to keep these objec=
ts
steadily in view, therefore the part of strategy in which he moves is also =
that
which is particularly subject to this difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Theory, therefore, especially where it comprehends the highest services, wi=
ll
stop much sooner in strategy than in tactics at the simple consideration of
things, and content itself to assist the Commander to that insight into thi=
ngs
which, blended with his whole thought, makes his course easier and surer, n=
ever
forces him into opposition with himself in order to obey an objective truth=
.

<h3><a name=3D"chap11"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>Art or Science of War</h3>

<h4>1.=E2=80=94USAGE STILL UNSETTLED<br>
(POWER AND KNOWLEDGE. SCIENCE WHEN MERE KNOWING; ART, WHEN DOING, IS THE
OBJECT.)
</h4>

<p>
The choice between these terms seems to be still unsettled, and no one seem=
s to
know rightly on what grounds it should be decided, and yet the thing is sim=
ple.
We have already said elsewhere that =E2=80=9Cknowing=E2=80=9D is something
different from =E2=80=9Cdoing.=E2=80=9D The two are so different that they =
should
not easily be mistaken the one for the other. The =E2=80=9Cdoing=E2=80=9D c=
annot
properly stand in any book, and therefore also Art should never be the titl=
e of
a book. But because we have once accustomed ourselves to combine in concept=
ion,
under the name of theory of Art, or simply Art, the branches of knowledge
(which may be separately pure sciences) necessary for the practice of an Ar=
t,
therefore it is consistent to continue this ground of distinction, and to c=
all
everything Art when the object is to carry out the =E2=80=9Cdoing=E2=80=9D =
(being
able), as for example, Art of building; Science, when merely knowledge is t=
he
object; as Science of mathematics, of astronomy. That in every Art certain
complete sciences may be included is intelligible of itself, and should not
perplex us. But still it is worth observing that there is also no science
without a mixture of Art. In mathematics, for instance, the use of figures =
and
of algebra is an Art, but that is only one amongst many instances. The reas=
on
is, that however plain and palpable the difference is between knowledge and
power in the composite results of human knowledge, yet it is difficult to t=
race
out their line of separation in man himself.
</p>

<h4>
2. DIFFICULTY OF SEPARATING PERCEPTION FROM JUDGMENT.<br>
(ART OF WAR.)
</h4>

<p>
All thinking is indeed Art. Where the logician draws the line, where the
premises stop which are the result of cognition=E2=80=94where judgment begi=
ns,
there Art begins. But more than this even the perception of the mind is
judgment again, and consequently Art; and at last, even the perception by t=
he
senses as well. In a word, if it is impossible to imagine a human being
possessing merely the faculty of cognition, devoid of judgment or the rever=
se,
so also Art and Science can never be completely separated from each other. =
The
more these subtle elements of light embody themselves in the outward forms =
of
the world, so much the more separate appear their domains; and now once mor=
e,
where the object is creation and production, there is the province of Art;
where the object is investigation and knowledge Science holds sway.=E2=80=
=94After
all this it results of itself that it is more fitting to say Art of War tha=
n
Science of War.
</p>

<p>
So much for this, because we cannot do without these conceptions. But now w=
e
come forward with the assertion that War is neither an Art nor a Science in=
 the
real signification, and that it is just the setting out from that
starting-point of ideas which has led to a wrong direction being taken, whi=
ch
has caused War to be put on a par with other arts and sciences, and has led=
 to
a number of erroneous analogies.
</p>

<p>
This has indeed been felt before now, and on that it was maintained that Wa=
r is
a handicraft; but there was more lost than gained by that, for a handicraft=
 is
only an inferior art, and as such is also subject to definite and rigid law=
s.
In reality the Art of War did go on for some time in the spirit of a
handicraft=E2=80=94we allude to the times of the Condottieri=E2=80=94but th=
en it
received that direction, not from intrinsic but from external causes; and
military history shows how little it was at that time in accordance with th=
e
nature of the thing.
</p>

<h4>
3. WAR IS PART OF THE INTERCOURSE OF THE HUMAN RACE.
</h4>

<p>
We say therefore War belongs not to the province of Arts and Sciences, but =
to
the province of social life. It is a conflict of great interests which is
settled by bloodshed, and only in that is it different from others. It woul=
d be
better, instead of comparing it with any Art, to liken it to business
competition, which is also a conflict of human interests and activities; an=
d it
is still more like State policy, which again, on its part, may be looked up=
on
as a kind of business competition on a great scale. Besides, State policy i=
s
the womb in which War is developed, in which its outlines lie hidden in a
rudimentary state, like the qualities of living creatures in their germs.(*=
)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) The analogy has become much closer since Clausewitz=E2=80=99s time. Now=
 that
the first business of the State is regarded as the development of facilitie=
s
for trade, War between great nations is only a question of time. No Hague
Conferences can avert it=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<h4>
4. DIFFERENCE.
</h4>

<p>
The essential difference consists in this, that War is no activity of the w=
ill,
which exerts itself upon inanimate matter like the mechanical Arts; or upon=
 a
living but still passive and yielding subject, like the human mind and the
human feelings in the ideal Arts, but against a living and reacting force. =
How
little the categories of Arts and Sciences are applicable to such an activi=
ty
strikes us at once; and we can understand at the same time how that constan=
t
seeking and striving after laws like those which may be developed out of th=
e
dead material world could not but lead to constant errors. And yet it is ju=
st
the mechanical Arts that some people would imitate in the Art of War. The
imitation of the ideal Arts was quite out of the question, because these
themselves dispense too much with laws and rules, and those hitherto tried,
always acknowledged as insufficient and one-sided, are perpetually undermin=
ed
and washed away by the current of opinions, feelings, and customs.
</p>

<p>
Whether such a conflict of the living, as takes place and is settled in War=
, is
subject to general laws, and whether these are capable of indicating a usef=
ul
line of action, will be partly investigated in this book; but so much is
evident in itself, that this, like every other subject which does not surpa=
ss
our powers of understanding, may be lighted up, and be made more or less pl=
ain
in its inner relations by an inquiring mind, and that alone is sufficient t=
o
realise the idea of a THEORY.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap12"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>Methodicism</h3>

<p>
In order to explain ourselves clearly as to the conception of method, and
method of action, which play such an important part in War, we must be allo=
wed
to cast a hasty glance at the logical hierarchy through which, as through
regularly constituted official functionaries, the world of action is govern=
ed.
</p>

<p>
<i>Law</i>, in the widest sense strictly applying to perception as well as =
action, has
plainly something subjective and arbitrary in its literal meaning, and
expresses just that on which we and those things external to us are depende=
nt.
As a subject of cognition, <i>Law</i> is the relation of things and their e=
ffects to
one another; as a subject of the will, it is a motive of action, and is the=
n
equivalent to <i>command</i> or <i>prohibition</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Principle</i> is likewise such a law for action, except that it has not =
the formal
definite meaning, but is only the spirit and sense of law in order to leave=
 the
judgment more freedom of application when the diversity of the real world
cannot be laid hold of under the definite form of a law. As the judgment mu=
st
of itself suggest the cases in which the principle is not applicable, the
latter therefore becomes in that way a real aid or guiding star for the per=
son
acting.
</p>

<p>
Principle is <i>objective</i> when it is the result of objective truth, and
consequently of equal value for all men; it is <i>subjective</i>, and then =
generally
called <i>maxim</i> if there are subjective relations in it, and if it ther=
efore has a
certain value only for the person himself who makes it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rule</i> is frequently taken in the sense of <i>Law</i>, and then means =
the same as
<i>Principle</i>, for we say =E2=80=9Cno rule without exceptions,=E2=80=9D =
but we do not
say =E2=80=9Cno law without exceptions,=E2=80=9D a sign that with <i>Rule</=
i> we retain to
ourselves more freedom of application.
</p>

<p>
In another meaning <i>Rule</i> is the means used of discerning a recondite =
truth in a
particular sign lying close at hand, in order to attach to this particular =
sign
the law of action directed upon the whole truth. Of this kind are all the r=
ules
of games of play, all abridged processes in mathematics, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
<i>Directions</i> and <i>instructions</i> are determinations of action whic=
h have an
influence upon a number of minor circumstances too numerous and unimportant=
 for
general laws.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, <i>Method, mode of acting</i>, is an always recurring proceeding se=
lected out
of several possible ones; and <i>Methodicism</i> (M<small>ETHODISMUS</small=
>) is that which is
determined by methods instead of by general principles or particular
prescriptions. By this the cases which are placed under such methods must
necessarily be supposed alike in their essential parts. As they cannot all =
be
this, then the point is that at least as many as possible should be; in oth=
er
words, that Method should be calculated on the most probable cases. Methodi=
cism
is therefore not founded on determined particular premises, but on the aver=
age
probability of cases one with another; and its ultimate tendency is to set =
up
an average truth, the constant and uniform, application of which soon acqui=
res
something of the nature of a mechanical appliance, which in the end does th=
at
which is right almost unwittingly.
</p>

<p>
The conception of law in relation to perception is not necessary for the
conduct of War, because the complex phenomena of War are not so regular, an=
d
the regular are not so complex, that we should gain anything more by this
conception than by the simple truth. And where a simple conception and lang=
uage
is sufficient, to resort to the complex becomes affected and pedantic. The
conception of law in relation to action cannot be used in the theory of the
conduct of War, because owing to the variableness and diversity of the
phenomena there is in it no determination of such a general nature as to
deserve the name of law.
</p>

<p>
But principles, rules, prescriptions, and methods are conceptions indispens=
able
to a theory of the conduct of War, in so far as that theory leads to positi=
ve
doctrines, because in doctrines the truth can only crystallise itself in su=
ch
forms.
</p>

<p>
As tactics is the branch of the conduct of War in which theory can attain t=
he
nearest to positive doctrine, therefore these conceptions will appear in it
most frequently.
</p>

<p>
Not to use cavalry against unbroken infantry except in some case of special
emergency, only to use firearms within effective range in the combat, to sp=
are
the forces as much as possible for the final struggle=E2=80=94these are tac=
tical
principles. None of them can be applied absolutely in every case, but they =
must
always be present to the mind of the Chief, in order that the benefit of th=
e
truth contained in them may not be lost in cases where that truth can be of
advantage.
</p>

<p>
If from the unusual cooking by an enemy=E2=80=99s camp his movement is infe=
rred,
if the intentional exposure of troops in a combat indicates a false attack,
then this way of discerning the truth is called rule, because from a single
visible circumstance that conclusion is drawn which corresponds with the sa=
me.
</p>

<p>
If it is a rule to attack the enemy with renewed vigour, as soon as he begi=
ns
to limber up his artillery in the combat, then on this particular fact depe=
nds
a course of action which is aimed at the general situation of the enemy as
inferred from the above fact, namely, that he is about to give up the fight=
,
that he is commencing to draw off his troops, and is neither capable of mak=
ing
a serious stand while thus drawing off nor of making his retreat gradually =
in
good order.
</p>

<p>
<i>Regulations</i> and <i>methods</i> bring preparatory theories into the c=
onduct of War, in
so far as disciplined troops are inoculated with them as active principles.=
 The
whole body of instructions for formations, drill, and field service are
regulations and methods: in the drill instructions the first predominate, i=
n
the field service instructions the latter. To these things the real conduct=
 of
War attaches itself; it takes them over, therefore, as given modes of
proceeding, and as such they must appear in the theory of the conduct of Wa=
r.
</p>

<p>
But for those activities retaining freedom in the employment of these force=
s
there cannot be regulations, that is, definite instructions, because they w=
ould
do away with freedom of action. Methods, on the other hand, as a general wa=
y of
executing duties as they arise, calculated, as we have said, on an average =
of
probability, or as a dominating influence of principles and rules carried
through to application, may certainly appear in the theory of the conduct o=
f
War, provided only they are not represented as something different from wha=
t
they are, not as the absolute and necessary modes of action (systems), but =
as
the best of general forms which may be used as shorter ways in place of a
particular disposition for the occasion, at discretion.
</p>

<p>
But the frequent application of methods will be seen to be most essential a=
nd
unavoidable in the conduct of War, if we reflect how much action proceeds o=
n
mere conjecture, or in complete uncertainty, because one side is prevented =
from
learning all the circumstances which influence the dispositions of the othe=
r,
or because, even if these circumstances which influence the decisions of th=
e
one were really known, there is not, owing to their extent and the disposit=
ions
they would entail, sufficient time for the other to carry out all necessary
counteracting measures=E2=80=94that therefore measures in War must always b=
e
calculated on a certain number of possibilities; if we reflect how numberle=
ss
are the trifling things belonging to any single event, and which therefore
should be taken into account along with it, and that therefore there is no
other means to suppose the one counteracted by the other, and to base our
arrangements only upon what is of a general nature and probable; if we refl=
ect
lastly that, owing to the increasing number of officers as we descend the s=
cale
of rank, less must be left to the true discernment and ripe judgment of
individuals the lower the sphere of action, and that when we reach those ra=
nks
where we can look for no other notions but those which the regulations of t=
he
service and experience afford, we must help them with the methodic forms
bordering on those regulations. This will serve both as a support to their
judgment and a barrier against those extravagant and erroneous views which =
are
so especially to be dreaded in a sphere where experience is so costly.
</p>

<p>
Besides this absolute need of method in action, we must also acknowledge th=
at
it has a positive advantage, which is that, through the constant repetition=
 of
a formal exercise, a readiness, precision, and firmness is attained in the
movement of troops which diminishes the natural friction, and makes the mac=
hine
move easier.
</p>

<p>
Method will therefore be the more generally used, become the more
indispensable, the farther down the scale of rank the position of the activ=
e
agent; and on the other hand, its use will diminish upwards, until in the
highest position it quite disappears. For this reason it is more in its pla=
ce
in tactics than in strategy.
</p>

<p>
War in its highest aspects consists not of an infinite number of little eve=
nts,
the diversities in which compensate each other, and which therefore by a be=
tter
or worse method are better or worse governed, but of separate great decisiv=
e
events which must be dealt with separately. It is not like a field of stalk=
s,
which, without any regard to the particular form of each stalk, will be mow=
ed
better or worse, according as the mowing instrument is good or bad, but rat=
her
as a group of large trees, to which the axe must be laid with judgment,
according to the particular form and inclination of each separate trunk.
</p>

<p>
How high up in military activity the admissibility of method in action reac=
hes
naturally determines itself, not according to actual rank, but according to
things; and it affects the highest positions in a less degree, only because
these positions have the most comprehensive subjects of activity. A constan=
t
order of battle, a constant formation of advance guards and outposts, are
methods by which a General ties not only his subordinates=E2=80=99 hands, b=
ut
also his own in certain cases. Certainly they may have been devised by hims=
elf,
and may be applied by him according to circumstances, but they may also be =
a
subject of theory, in so far as they are based on the general properties of
troops and weapons. On the other hand, any method by which definite plans f=
or
wars or campaigns are to be given out all ready made as if from a machine a=
re
absolutely worthless.
</p>

<p>
As long as there exists no theory which can be sustained, that is, no
enlightened treatise on the conduct of War, method in action cannot but
encroach beyond its proper limits in high places, for men employed in these
spheres of activity have not always had the opportunity of educating
themselves, through study and through contact with the higher interests. In=
 the
impracticable and inconsistent disquisitions of theorists and critics they
cannot find their way, their sound common sense rejects them, and as they b=
ring
with them no knowledge but that derived from experience, therefore in those
cases which admit of, and require, a free individual treatment they readily
make use of the means which experience gives them=E2=80=94that is, an imita=
tion
of the particular methods practised by great Generals, by which a method of
action then arises of itself. If we see Frederick the Great=E2=80=99s Gener=
als
always making their appearance in the so-called oblique order of battle, th=
e
Generals of the French Revolution always using turning movements with a lon=
g,
extended line of battle, and Buonaparte=E2=80=99s lieutenants rushing to th=
e
attack with the bloody energy of concentrated masses, then we recognise in =
the
recurrence of the mode of proceeding evidently an adopted method, and see
therefore that method of action can reach up to regions bordering on the
highest. Should an improved theory facilitate the study of the conduct of W=
ar,
form the mind and judgment of men who are rising to the highest commands, t=
hen
also method in action will no longer reach so far, and so much of it as is =
to
be considered indispensable will then at least be formed from theory itself=
,
and not take place out of mere imitation. However pre-eminently a great
Commander does things, there is always something subjective in the way he d=
oes
them; and if he has a certain manner, a large share of his individuality is
contained in it which does not always accord with the individuality of the
person who copies his manner.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, it would neither be possible nor right to banish subjecti=
ve
methodicism or manner completely from the conduct of War: it is rather to b=
e
regarded as a manifestation of that influence which the general character o=
f a
War has upon its separate events, and to which satisfaction can only be don=
e in
that way if theory is not able to foresee this general character and includ=
e it
in its considerations. What is more natural than that the War of the French
Revolution had its own way of doing things? and what theory could ever have
included that peculiar method? The evil is only that such a manner originat=
ing
in a special case easily outlives itself, because it continues whilst
circumstances imperceptibly change. This is what theory should prevent by l=
ucid
and rational criticism. When in the year 1806 the Prussian Generals, Prince
Louis at Saalfeld, Tauentzien on the Dornberg near Jena, Grawert before and
Ruechel behind Kappellendorf, all threw themselves into the open jaws of
destruction in the oblique order of Frederick the Great, and managed to rui=
n
Hohenlohe=E2=80=99s Army in a way that no Army was ever ruined, even on the=
 field
of battle, all this was done through a manner which had outlived its day,
together with the most downright stupidity to which methodicism ever led.

<h3><a name=3D"chap13"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Criticism</h3>

<p>
The influence of theoretical principles upon real life is produced more thr=
ough
criticism than through doctrine, for as criticism is an application of abst=
ract
truth to real events, therefore it not only brings truth of this descriptio=
n
nearer to life, but also accustoms the understanding more to such truths by=
 the
constant repetition of their application. We therefore think it necessary t=
o
fix the point of view for criticism next to that for theory.
</p>

<p>
From the simple narration of an historical occurrence which places events i=
n
chronological order, or at most only touches on their more immediate causes=
, we
separate the CRITICAL.
</p>

<p>
In this CRITICAL three different operations of the mind may be observed.
</p>

<p>
First, the historical investigation and determining of doubtful facts. This=
 is
properly historical research, and has nothing in common with theory.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the tracing of effects to causes. This is the REAL CRITICAL INQUI=
RY;
it is indispensable to theory, for everything which in theory is to be
established, supported, or even merely explained, by experience can only be
settled in this way.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the testing of the means employed. This is criticism, properly
speaking, in which praise and censure is contained. This is where theory he=
lps
history, or rather, the teaching to be derived from it.
</p>

<p>
In these two last strictly critical parts of historical study, all depends =
on
tracing things to their primary elements, that is to say, up to undoubted
truths, and not, as is so often done, resting half-way, that is, on some
arbitrary assumption or supposition.
</p>

<p>
As respects the tracing of effect to cause, that is often attended with the
insuperable difficulty that the real causes are not known. In none of the
relations of life does this so frequently happen as in War, where events ar=
e
seldom fully known, and still less motives, as the latter have been, perhap=
s
purposely, concealed by the chief actor, or have been of such a transient a=
nd
accidental character that they have been lost for history. For this reason
critical narration must generally proceed hand in hand with historical
investigation, and still such a want of connection between cause and effect
will often present itself, that it does not seem justifiable to consider
effects as the necessary results of known causes. Here, therefore must occu=
r,
that is, historical results which cannot be made use of for teaching. All t=
hat
theory can demand is that the investigation should be rigidly conducted up =
to
that point, and there leave off without drawing conclusions. A real evil
springs up only if the known is made perforce to suffice as an explanation =
of
effects, and thus a false importance is ascribed to it.
</p>

<p>
Besides this difficulty, critical inquiry also meets with another great and
intrinsic one, which is that the progress of events in War seldom proceeds =
from
one simple cause, but from several in common, and that it therefore is not
sufficient to follow up a series of events to their origin in a candid and
impartial spirit, but that it is then also necessary to apportion to each
contributing cause its due weight. This leads, therefore, to a closer
investigation of their nature, and thus a critical investigation may lead i=
nto
what is the proper field of theory.
</p>

<p>
The critical CONSIDERATION, that is, the testing of the means, leads to the
question, Which are the effects peculiar to the means applied, and whether
these effects were comprehended in the plans of the person directing?
</p>

<p>
The effects peculiar to the means lead to the investigation of their nature=
,
and thus again into the field of theory.
</p>

<p>
We have already seen that in criticism all depends upon attaining to positi=
ve
truth; therefore, that we must not stop at arbitrary propositions which are=
 not
allowed by others, and to which other perhaps equally arbitrary assertions =
may
again be opposed, so that there is no end to pros and cons; the whole is
without result, and therefore without instruction.
</p>

<p>
We have seen that both the search for causes and the examination of means l=
ead
into the field of theory; that is, into the field of universal truth, which
does not proceed solely from the case immediately under examination. If the=
re
is a theory which can be used, then the critical consideration will appeal =
to
the proofs there afforded, and the examination may there stop. But where no
such theoretical truth is to be found, the inquiry must be pushed up to the
original elements. If this necessity occurs often, it must lead the histori=
an
(according to a common expression) into a labyrinth of details. He then has=
 his
hands full, and it is impossible for him to stop to give the requisite
attention everywhere; the consequence is, that in order to set bounds to hi=
s
investigation, he adopts some arbitrary assumptions which, if they do not
appear so to him, do so to others, as they are not evident in themselves or
capable of proof.
</p>

<p>
A sound theory is therefore an essential foundation for criticism, and it i=
s
impossible for it, without the assistance of a sensible theory, to attain t=
o
that point at which it commences chiefly to be instructive, that is, where =
it
becomes demonstration, both convincing and sans r=C3=A9plique.
</p>

<p>
But it would be a visionary hope to believe in the possibility of a theory
applicable to every abstract truth, leaving nothing for criticism to do but=
 to
place the case under its appropriate law: it would be ridiculous pedantry t=
o
lay down as a rule for criticism that it must always halt and turn round on
reaching the boundaries of sacred theory. The same spirit of analytical inq=
uiry
which is the origin of theory must also guide the critic in his work; and i=
t
can and must therefore happen that he strays beyond the boundaries of the
province of theory and elucidates those points with which he is more
particularly concerned. It is more likely, on the contrary, that criticism
would completely fail in its object if it degenerated into a mechanical
application of theory. All positive results of theoretical inquiry, all
principles, rules, and methods, are the more wanting in generality and posi=
tive
truth the more they become positive doctrine. They exist to offer themselve=
s
for use as required, and it must always be left for judgment to decide whet=
her
they are suitable or not. Such results of theory must never be used in
criticism as rules or norms for a standard, but in the same way as the pers=
on
acting should use them, that is, merely as aids to judgment. If it is an
acknowledged principle in tactics that in the usual order of battle cavalry
should be placed behind infantry, not in line with it, still it would be fo=
lly
on this account to condemn every deviation from this principle. Criticism m=
ust
investigate the grounds of the deviation, and it is only in case these are
insufficient that it has a right to appeal to principles laid down in theor=
y.
If it is further established in theory that a divided attack diminishes the
probability of success, still it would be just as unreasonable, whenever th=
ere
is a divided attack and an unsuccessful issue, to regard the latter as the
result of the former, without further investigation into the connection bet=
ween
the two, as where a divided attack is successful to infer from it the falla=
cy
of that theoretical principle. The spirit of investigation which belongs to
criticism cannot allow either. Criticism therefore supports itself chiefly =
on
the results of the analytical investigation of theory; what has been made o=
ut
and determined by theory does not require to be demonstrated over again by
criticism, and it is so determined by theory that criticism may find it rea=
dy
demonstrated.
</p>

<p>
This office of criticism, of examining the effect produced by certain cause=
s,
and whether a means applied has answered its object, will be easy enough if
cause and effect, means and end, are all near together.
</p>

<p>
If an Army is surprised, and therefore cannot make a regular and intelligen=
t
use of its powers and resources, then the effect of the surprise is not
doubtful.=E2=80=94If theory has determined that in a battle the convergent =
form
of attack is calculated to produce greater but less certain results, then t=
he
question is whether he who employs that convergent form had in view chiefly
that greatness of result as his object; if so, the proper means were chosen=
.
But if by this form he intended to make the result more certain, and that
expectation was founded not on some exceptional circumstances (in this case=
),
but on the general nature of the convergent form, as has happened a hundred
times, then he mistook the nature of the means and committed an error.
</p>

<p>
Here the work of military investigation and criticism is easy, and it will
always be so when confined to the immediate effects and objects. This can b=
e
done quite at option, if we abstract the connection of the parts with the
whole, and only look at things in that relation.
</p>

<p>
But in War, as generally in the world, there is a connection between everyt=
hing
which belongs to a whole; and therefore, however small a cause may be in
itself, its effects reach to the end of the act of warfare, and modify or
influence the final result in some degree, let that degree be ever so small=
. In
the same manner every means must be felt up to the ultimate object.
</p>

<p>
We can therefore trace the effects of a cause as long as events are worth
noticing, and in the same way we must not stop at the testing of a means fo=
r
the immediate object, but test also this object as a means to a higher one,=
 and
thus ascend the series of facts in succession, until we come to one so
absolutely necessary in its nature as to require no examination or proof. I=
n
many cases, particularly in what concerns great and decisive measures, the
investigation must be carried to the final aim, to that which leads immedia=
tely
to peace.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that in thus ascending, at every new station which we reach a=
 new
point of view for the judgment is attained, so that the same means which
appeared advisable at one station, when looked at from the next above it ma=
y
have to be rejected.
</p>

<p>
The search for the causes of events and the comparison of means with ends m=
ust
always go hand in hand in the critical review of an act, for the investigat=
ion
of causes leads us first to the discovery of those things which are worth
examining.
</p>

<p>
This following of the clue up and down is attended with considerable
difficulty, for the farther from an event the cause lies which we are looki=
ng
for, the greater must be the number of other causes which must at the same =
time
be kept in view and allowed for in reference to the share which they have i=
n
the course of events, and then eliminated, because the higher the importanc=
e of
a fact the greater will be the number of separate forces and circumstances =
by
which it is conditioned. If we have unravelled the causes of a battle being
lost, we have certainly also ascertained a part of the causes of the
consequences which this defeat has upon the whole War, but only a part, bec=
ause
the effects of other causes, more or less according to circumstances, will =
flow
into the final result.
</p>

<p>
The same multiplicity of circumstances is presented also in the examination=
 of
the means the higher our point of view, for the higher the object is situat=
ed,
the greater must be the number of means employed to reach it. The ultimate
object of the War is the object aimed at by all the Armies simultaneously, =
and
it is therefore necessary that the consideration should embrace all that ea=
ch
has done or could have done.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that this may sometimes lead to a wide field of inquiry, in w=
hich
it is easy to wander and lose the way, and in which this difficulty
prevails=E2=80=94that a number of assumptions or suppositions must be made =
about
a variety of things which do not actually appear, but which in all probabil=
ity
did take place, and therefore cannot possibly be left out of consideration.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte, in 1797,(*) at the head of the Army of Italy, advanced fro=
m
the Tagliamento against the Archduke Charles, he did so with a view to forc=
e
that General to a decisive action before the reinforcements expected from t=
he
Rhine had reached him. If we look, only at the immediate object, the means =
were
well chosen and justified by the result, for the Archduke was so inferior i=
n
numbers that he only made a show of resistance on the Tagliamento, and when=
 he
saw his adversary so strong and resolute, yielded ground, and left open the
passages, of the Norican Alps. Now to what use could Buonaparte turn this
fortunate event? To penetrate into the heart of the Austrian empire itself,=
 to
facilitate the advance of the Rhine Armies under Moreau and Hoche, and open
communication with them? This was the view taken by Buonaparte, and from th=
is
point of view he was right. But now, if criticism places itself at a higher
point of view=E2=80=94namely, that of the French Directory, which body coul=
d see
and know that the Armies on the Rhine could not commence the campaign for s=
ix
weeks, then the advance of Buonaparte over the Norican Alps can only be
regarded as an extremely hazardous measure; for if the Austrians had drawn
largely on their Rhine Armies to reinforce their Army in Styria, so as to
enable the Archduke to fall upon the Army of Italy, not only would that Arm=
y
have been routed, but the whole campaign lost. This consideration, which
attracted the serious attention of Buonaparte at Villach, no doubt induced =
him
to sign the armistice of Leoben with so much readiness.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Compare <i>Hinterlassene Werke</i>, 2nd edition, vol. iv. p. 276 <i>et =
seq.</i>
</p>

<p>
If criticism takes a still higher position, and if it knows that the Austri=
ans
had no reserves between the Army of the Archduke Charles and Vienna, then w=
e
see that Vienna became threatened by the advance of the Army of Italy.
</p>

<p>
Supposing that Buonaparte knew that the capital was thus uncovered, and kne=
w
that he still retained the same superiority in numbers over the Archduke as=
 he
had in Styria, then his advance against the heart of the Austrian States wa=
s no
longer without purpose, and its value depended on the value which the Austr=
ians
might place on preserving their capital. If that was so great that, rather =
than
lose it, they would accept the conditions of peace which Buonaparte was rea=
dy
to offer them, it became an object of the first importance to threaten Vien=
na.
If Buonaparte had any reason to know this, then criticism may stop there, b=
ut
if this point was only problematical, then criticism must take a still high=
er
position, and ask what would have followed if the Austrians had resolved to
abandon Vienna and retire farther into the vast dominions still left to the=
m.
But it is easy to see that this question cannot be answered without bringin=
g
into the consideration the probable movements of the Rhine Armies on both
sides. Through the decided superiority of numbers on the side of the
French=E2=80=94130,000 to 80,000=E2=80=94there could be little doubt of the=
 result;
but then next arises the question, What use would the Directory make of a
victory; whether they would follow up their success to the opposite frontie=
rs
of the Austrian monarchy, therefore to the complete breaking up or overthro=
w of
that power, or whether they would be satisfied with the conquest of a
considerable portion to serve as a security for peace? The probable result =
in
each case must be estimated, in order to come to a conclusion as to the
probable determination of the Directory. Supposing the result of these
considerations to be that the French forces were much too weak for the comp=
lete
subjugation of the Austrian monarchy, so that the attempt might completely
reverse the respective positions of the contending Armies, and that even th=
e
conquest and occupation of a considerable district of country would place t=
he
French Army in strategic relations to which they were not equal, then that
result must naturally influence the estimate of the position of the Army of
Italy, and compel it to lower its expectations. And this, it was no doubt w=
hich
influenced Buonaparte, although fully aware of the helpless condition of th=
e
Archduke, still to sign the peace of Campo Formio, which imposed no greater
sacrifices on the Austrians than the loss of provinces which, even if the
campaign took the most favourable turn for them, they could not have
reconquered. But the French could not have reckoned on even the moderate tr=
eaty
of Campo Formio, and therefore it could not have been their object in makin=
g
their bold advance if two considerations had not presented themselves to th=
eir
view, the first of which consisted in the question, what degree of value th=
e
Austrians would attach to each of the above-mentioned results; whether,
notwithstanding the probability of a satisfactory result in either of these
cases, would it be worth while to make the sacrifices inseparable from a
continuance of the War, when they could be spared those sacrifices by a pea=
ce
on terms not too humiliating? The second consideration is the question whet=
her
the Austrian Government, instead of seriously weighing the possible results=
 of
a resistance pushed to extremities, would not prove completely disheartened=
 by
the impression of their present reverses.
</p>

<p>
The consideration which forms the subject of the first is no idle piece of
subtle argument, but a consideration of such decidedly practical importance
that it comes up whenever the plan of pushing War to the utmost extremity i=
s
mooted, and by its weight in most cases restrains the execution of such pla=
ns.
</p>

<p>
The second consideration is of equal importance, for we do not make War wit=
h an
abstraction but with a reality, which we must always keep in view, and we m=
ay
be sure that it was not overlooked by the bold Buonaparte=E2=80=94that is, =
that
he was keenly alive to the terror which the appearance of his sword inspire=
d.
It was reliance on that which led him to Moscow. There it led him into a
scrape. The terror of him had been weakened by the gigantic struggles in wh=
ich
he had been engaged; in the year 1797 it was still fresh, and the secret of=
 a
resistance pushed to extremities had not been discovered; nevertheless even=
 in
1797 his boldness might have led to a negative result if, as already said, =
he
had not with a sort of presentiment avoided it by signing the moderate peac=
e of
Campo Formio.
</p>

<p>
We must now bring these considerations to a close=E2=80=94they will suffice=
 to
show the wide sphere, the diversity and embarrassing nature of the subjects
embraced in a critical examination carried to the fullest extent, that is, =
to
those measures of a great and decisive class which must necessarily be
included. It follows from them that besides a theoretical acquaintance with=
 the
subject, natural talent must also have a great influence on the value of
critical examinations, for it rests chiefly with the latter to throw the
requisite light on the interrelations of things, and to distinguish from
amongst the endless connections of events those which are really essential.
</p>

<p>
But talent is also called into requisition in another way. Critical examina=
tion
is not merely the appreciation of those means which have been actually
employed, but also of all possible means, which therefore must be suggested=
 in
the first place=E2=80=94that is, must be discovered; and the use of any
particular means is not fairly open to censure until a better is pointed ou=
t.
Now, however small the number of possible combinations may be in most cases=
,
still it must be admitted that to point out those which have not been used =
is
not a mere analysis of actual things, but a spontaneous creation which cann=
ot
be prescribed, and depends on the fertility of genius.
</p>

<p>
We are far from seeing a field for great genius in a case which admits only=
 of
the application of a few simple combinations, and we think it exceedingly
ridiculous to hold up, as is often done, the turning of a position as an
invention showing the highest genius; still nevertheless this creative
self-activity on the part of the critic is necessary, and it is one of the
points which essentially determine the value of critical examination.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte on 30th July, 1796,(*) determined to raise the siege of Man=
tua,
in order to march with his whole force against the enemy, advancing in sepa=
rate
columns to the relief of the place, and to beat them in detail, this appear=
ed
the surest way to the attainment of brilliant victories. These victories
actually followed, and were afterwards again repeated on a still more brill=
iant
scale on the attempt to relieve the fortress being again renewed. We hear o=
nly
one opinion on these achievements, that of unmixed admiration.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Compare <i>Hinterlassene Werke</i>, 2nd edition, vol. iv. p. 107 <i>et =
seq</i>.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, Buonaparte could not have adopted this course on the 30th
July without quite giving up the idea of the siege of Mantua, because it wa=
s
impossible to save the siege train, and it could not be replaced by another=
 in
this campaign. In fact, the siege was converted into a blockade, and the to=
wn,
which if the siege had continued must have very shortly fallen, held out fo=
r
six months in spite of Buonaparte=E2=80=99s victories in the open field.
</p>

<p>
Criticism has generally regarded this as an evil that was unavoidable, beca=
use
critics have not been able to suggest any better course. Resistance to a
relieving Army within lines of circumvallation had fallen into such disrepu=
te
and contempt that it appears to have entirely escaped consideration as a me=
ans.
And yet in the reign of Louis XIV. that measure was so often used with succ=
ess
that we can only attribute to the force of fashion the fact that a hundred
years later it never occurred to any one even to propose such a measure. If=
 the
practicability of such a plan had ever been entertained for a moment, a clo=
ser
consideration of circumstances would have shown that 40,000 of the best
infantry in the world under Buonaparte, behind strong lines of circumvallat=
ion
round Mantua, had so little to fear from the 50,000 men coming to the relie=
f
under Wurmser, that it was very unlikely that any attempt even would be mad=
e
upon their lines. We shall not seek here to establish this point, but we
believe enough has been said to show that this means was one which had a ri=
ght
to a share of consideration. Whether Buonaparte himself ever thought of suc=
h a
plan we leave undecided; neither in his memoirs nor in other sources is the=
re
any trace to be found of his having done so; in no critical works has it be=
en
touched upon, the measure being one which the mind had lost sight of. The m=
erit
of resuscitating the idea of this means is not great, for it suggests itsel=
f at
once to any one who breaks loose from the trammels of fashion. Still it is
necessary that it should suggest itself for us to bring it into considerati=
on
and compare it with the means which Buonaparte employed. Whatever may be th=
e
result of the comparison, it is one which should not be omitted by criticis=
m.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte, in February, 1814,(*) after gaining the battles at Etoges,
Champ-Aubert, and Montmirail, left Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s Army, and turning=
 upon
Schwartzenberg, beat his troops at Montereau and Mormant, every one was fil=
led
with admiration, because Buonaparte, by thus throwing his concentrated forc=
e
first upon one opponent, then upon another, made a brilliant use of the
mistakes which his adversaries had committed in dividing their forces. If t=
hese
brilliant strokes in different directions failed to save him, it was genera=
lly
considered to be no fault of his, at least. No one has yet asked the questi=
on,
What would have been the result if, instead of turning from Bl=C3=BCcher up=
on
Schwartzenberg, he had tried another blow at Bl=C3=BCcher, and pursued him =
to the
Rhine? We are convinced that it would have completely changed the course of=
 the
campaign, and that the Army of the Allies, instead of marching to Paris, wo=
uld
have retired behind the Rhine. We do not ask others to share our conviction=
,
but no one who understands the thing will doubt, at the mere mention of thi=
s
alternative course, that it is one which should not be overlooked in critic=
ism.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Compare <i>Hinterlassene Werke</i>, 2nd edition. vol. vii. p. 193 <i>et=
 seq</i>.
</p>

<p>
In this case the means of comparison lie much more on the surface than in t=
he
foregoing, but they have been equally overlooked, because one-sided views h=
ave
prevailed, and there has been no freedom of judgment.
</p>

<p>
From the necessity of pointing out a better means which might have been use=
d in
place of those which are condemned has arisen the form of criticism almost
exclusively in use, which contents itself with pointing out the better mean=
s
without demonstrating in what the superiority consists. The consequence is =
that
some are not convinced, that others start up and do the same thing, and tha=
t
thus discussion arises which is without any fixed basis for the argument.
Military literature abounds with matter of this sort.
</p>

<p>
The demonstration we require is always necessary when the superiority of th=
e
means propounded is not so evident as to leave no room for doubt, and it
consists in the examination of each of the means on its own merits, and the=
n of
its comparison with the object desired. When once the thing is traced back =
to a
simple truth, controversy must cease, or at all events a new result is
obtained, whilst by the other plan the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> go on fo=
r ever consuming
each other.
</p>

<p>
Should we, for example, not rest content with assertion in the case before
mentioned, and wish to prove that the persistent pursuit of Bl=C3=BCcher wo=
uld have
been more advantageous than the turning on Schwartzenberg, we should suppor=
t
the arguments on the following simple truths:
</p>

<p>
1. In general it is more advantageous to continue our blows in one and the =
same
direction, because there is a loss of time in striking in different directi=
ons;
and at a point where the moral power is already shaken by considerable loss=
es
there is the more reason to expect fresh successes, therefore in that way n=
o
part of the preponderance already gained is left idle.
</p>

<p>
2. Because Bl=C3=BCcher, although weaker than Schwartzenberg, was, on accou=
nt of
his enterprising spirit, the more important adversary; in him, therefore, l=
ay
the centre of attraction which drew the others along in the same direction.
</p>

<p>
3. Because the losses which Bl=C3=BCcher had sustained almost amounted to a=
 defeat,
which gave Buonaparte such a preponderance over him as to make his retreat =
to
the Rhine almost certain, and at the same time no reserves of any consequen=
ce
awaited him there.
</p>

<p>
4. Because there was no other result which would be so terrific in its aspe=
cts,
would appear to the imagination in such gigantic proportions, an immense
advantage in dealing with a Staff so weak and irresolute as that of
Schwartzenberg notoriously was at this time. What had happened to the Crown
Prince of Wartemberg at Montereau, and to Count Wittgenstein at Mormant, Pr=
ince
Schwartzenberg must have known well enough; but all the untoward events on
Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s distant and separate line from the Marne to the Rhin=
e would
only reach him by the avalanche of rumour. The desperate movements which
Buonaparte made upon Vitry at the end of March, to see what the Allies woul=
d do
if he threatened to turn them strategically, were evidently done on the
principle of working on their fears; but it was done under far different
circumstances, in consequence of his defeat at Laon and Arcis, and because
Bl=C3=BCcher, with 100,000 men, was then in communication with Schwartzenbe=
rg.
</p>

<p>
There are people, no doubt, who will not be convinced on these arguments, b=
ut
at all events they cannot retort by saying, that =E2=80=9Cwhilst Buonaparte
threatened Schwartzenberg=E2=80=99s base by advancing to the Rhine,
Schwartzenberg at the same time threatened Buonaparte=E2=80=99s communicati=
ons
with Paris,=E2=80=9D because we have shown by the reasons above given that
Schwartzenberg would never have thought of marching on Paris.
</p>

<p>
With respect to the example quoted by us from the campaign of 1796, we shou=
ld
say: Buonaparte looked upon the plan he adopted as the surest means of beat=
ing
the Austrians; but admitting that it was so, still the object to be attaine=
d
was only an empty victory, which could have hardly any sensible influence o=
n
the fall of Mantua. The way which we should have chosen would, in our opini=
on,
have been much more certain to prevent the relief of Mantua; but even if we
place ourselves in the position of the French General and assume that it wa=
s
not so, and look upon the certainty of success to have been less, the quest=
ion
then amounts to a choice between a more certain but less useful, and theref=
ore
less important, victory on the one hand, and a somewhat less probable but f=
ar
more decisive and important victory, on the other hand. Presented in this f=
orm,
boldness must have declared for the second solution, which is the reverse o=
f
what took place, when the thing was only superficially viewed. Buonaparte
certainly was anything but deficient in boldness, and we may be sure that h=
e
did not see the whole case and its consequences as fully and clearly as we =
can
at the present time.
</p>

<p>
Naturally the critic, in treating of the means, must often appeal to milita=
ry
history, as experience is of more value in the Art of War than all
philosophical truth. But this exemplification from history is subject to
certain conditions, of which we shall treat in a special chapter and
unfortunately these conditions are so seldom regarded that reference to his=
tory
generally only serves to increase the confusion of ideas.
</p>

<p>
We have still a most important subject to consider, which is, How far criti=
cism
in passing judgments on particular events is permitted, or in duty bound, t=
o
make use of its wider view of things, and therefore also of that which is s=
hown
by results; or when and where it should leave out of sight these things in
order to place itself, as far as possible, in the exact position of the chi=
ef
actor?
</p>

<p>
If criticism dispenses praise or censure, it should seek to place itself as
nearly as possible at the same point of view as the person acting, that is =
to
say, to collect all he knew and all the motives on which he acted, and, on =
the
other hand, to leave out of the consideration all that the person acting co=
uld
not or did not know, and above all, the result. But this is only an object =
to
aim at, which can never be reached because the state of circumstances from
which an event proceeded can never be placed before the eye of the critic
exactly as it lay before the eye of the person acting. A number of inferior
circumstances, which must have influenced the result, are completely lost t=
o
sight, and many a subjective motive has never come to light.
</p>

<p>
The latter can only be learnt from the memoirs of the chief actor, or from =
his
intimate friends; and in such things of this kind are often treated of in a
very desultory manner, or purposely misrepresented. Criticism must, therefo=
re,
always forego much which was present in the minds of those whose acts are
criticised.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it is much more difficult to leave out of sight that whi=
ch
criticism knows in excess. This is only easy as regards accidental
circumstances, that is, circumstances which have been mixed up, but are in =
no
way necessarily related. But it is very difficult, and, in fact, can never =
be
completely done with regard to things really essential.
</p>

<p>
Let us take first, the result. If it has not proceeded from accidental
circumstances, it is almost impossible that the knowledge of it should not =
have
an effect on the judgment passed on events which have preceded it, for we s=
ee
these things in the light of this result, and it is to a certain extent by =
it
that we first become acquainted with them and appreciate them. Military
history, with all its events, is a source of instruction for criticism itse=
lf,
and it is only natural that criticism should throw that light on things whi=
ch
it has itself obtained from the consideration of the whole. If therefore it
might wish in some cases to leave the result out of the consideration, it w=
ould
be impossible to do so completely.
</p>

<p>
But it is not only in relation to the result, that is, with what takes plac=
e at
the last, that this embarrassment arises; the same occurs in relation to
preceding events, therefore with the data which furnished the motives to
action. Criticism has before it, in most cases, more information on this po=
int
than the principal in the transaction. Now it may seem easy to dismiss from=
 the
consideration everything of this nature, but it is not so easy as we may th=
ink.
The knowledge of preceding and concurrent events is founded not only on cer=
tain
information, but on a number of conjectures and suppositions; indeed, there=
 is
hardly any of the information respecting things not purely accidental which=
 has
not been preceded by suppositions or conjectures destined to take the place=
 of
certain information in case such should never be supplied. Now is it
conceivable that criticism in after times, which has before it as facts all=
 the
preceding and concurrent circumstances, should not allow itself to be there=
by
influenced when it asks itself the question, What portion of the circumstan=
ces,
which at the moment of action were unknown, would it have held to be probab=
le?
We maintain that in this case, as in the case of the results, and for the s=
ame
reason, it is impossible to disregard all these things completely.
</p>

<p>
If therefore the critic wishes to bestow praise or blame upon any single ac=
t,
he can only succeed to a certain degree in placing himself in the position =
of
the person whose act he has under review. In many cases he can do so
sufficiently near for any practical purpose, but in many instances it is th=
e
very reverse, and this fact should never be overlooked.
</p>

<p>
But it is neither necessary nor desirable that criticism should completely
identify itself with the person acting. In War, as in all matters of skill,
there is a certain natural aptitude required which is called talent. This m=
ay
be great or small. In the first case it may easily be superior to that of t=
he
critic, for what critic can pretend to the skill of a Frederick or a
Buonaparte? Therefore, if criticism is not to abstain altogether from offer=
ing
an opinion where eminent talent is concerned, it must be allowed to make us=
e of
the advantage which its enlarged horizon affords. Criticism must not,
therefore, treat the solution of a problem by a great General like a sum in
arithmetic; it is only through the results and through the exact coincidenc=
es
of events that it can recognise with admiration how much is due to the exer=
cise
of genius, and that it first learns the essential combination which the gla=
nce
of that genius devised.
</p>

<p>
But for every, even the smallest, act of genius it is necessary that critic=
ism
should take a higher point of view, so that, having at command many objecti=
ve
grounds of decision, it may be as little subjective as possible, and that t=
he
critic may not take the limited scope of his own mind as a standard.
</p>

<p>
This elevated position of criticism, its praise and blame pronounced with a
full knowledge of all the circumstances, has in itself nothing which hurts =
our
feelings; it only does so if the critic pushes himself forward, and speaks =
in a
tone as if all the wisdom which he has obtained by an exhaustive examinatio=
n of
the event under consideration were really his own talent. Palpable as is th=
is
deception, it is one which people may easily fall into through vanity, and =
one
which is naturally distasteful to others. It very often happens that althou=
gh
the critic has no such arrogant pretensions, they are imputed to him by the
reader because he has not expressly disclaimed them, and then follows
immediately a charge of a want of the power of critical judgment.
</p>

<p>
If therefore a critic points out an error made by a Frederick or a Buonapar=
te,
that does not mean that he who makes the criticism would not have committed=
 the
same error; he may even be ready to grant that had he been in the place of
these great Generals he might have made much greater mistakes; he merely se=
es
this error from the chain of events, and he thinks that it should not have
escaped the sagacity of the General.
</p>

<p>
This is, therefore, an opinion formed through the connection of events, and
therefore through the RESULT. But there is another quite different effect o=
f
the result itself upon the judgment, that is if it is used quite alone as a=
n
example for or against the soundness of a measure. This may be called JUDGM=
ENT
ACCORDING TO THE RESULT. Such a judgment appears at first sight inadmissibl=
e,
and yet it is not.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte marched to Moscow in 1812, all depended upon whether the ta=
king
of the capital, and the events which preceded the capture, would force the
Emperor Alexander to make peace, as he had been compelled to do after the
battle of Friedland in 1807, and the Emperor Francis in 1805 and 1809 after
Austerlitz and Wagram; for if Buonaparte did not obtain a peace at Moscow,
there was no alternative but to return=E2=80=94that is, there was nothing f=
or him
but a strategic defeat. We shall leave out of the question what he did to g=
et
to Moscow, and whether in his advance he did not miss many opportunities of
bringing the Emperor Alexander to peace; we shall also exclude all
consideration of the disastrous circumstances which attended his retreat, a=
nd
which perhaps had their origin in the general conduct of the campaign. Stil=
l
the question remains the same, for however much more brilliant the course o=
f
the campaign up to Moscow might have been, still there was always an
uncertainty whether the Emperor Alexander would be intimidated into making
peace; and then, even if a retreat did not contain in itself the seeds of s=
uch
disasters as did in fact occur, still it could never be anything else than =
a
great strategic defeat. If the Emperor Alexander agreed to a peace which wa=
s
disadvantageous to him, the campaign of 1812 would have ranked with those o=
f
Austerlitz, Friedland, and Wagram. But these campaigns also, if they had no=
t
led to peace, would in all probability have ended in similar catastrophes.
Whatever, therefore, of genius, skill, and energy the Conqueror of the Worl=
d
applied to the task, this last question addressed to fate(*) remained alway=
s
the same. Shall we then discard the campaigns of 1805, 1807, 1809, and say =
on
account of the campaign of 1812 that they were acts of imprudence; that the
results were against the nature of things, and that in 1812 strategic justi=
ce
at last found vent for itself in opposition to blind chance? That would be =
an
unwarrantable conclusion, a most arbitrary judgment, a case only half prove=
d,
because no human, eye can trace the thread of the necessary connection of
events up to the determination of the conquered Princes.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) =E2=80=9CFrage an der Schicksal,=E2=80=9D a familiar quotation from
Schiller.=E2=80=94TR.
</p>

<p>
Still less can we say the campaign of 1812 merited the same success as the
others, and that the reason why it turned out otherwise lies in something
unnatural, for we cannot regard the firmness of Alexander as something
unpredictable.
</p>

<p>
What can be more natural than to say that in the years 1805, 1807, 1809,
Buonaparte judged his opponents correctly, and that in 1812 he erred in tha=
t
point? On the former occasions, therefore, he was right, in the latter wron=
g,
and in both cases we judge by the <i>result</i>.
</p>

<p>
All action in War, as we have already said, is directed on probable, not on
certain, results. Whatever is wanting in certainty must always be left to f=
ate,
or chance, call it which you will. We may demand that what is so left shoul=
d be
as little as possible, but only in relation to the particular case=E2=80=94=
that
is, as little as is possible in this one case, but not that the case in whi=
ch
the least is left to chance is always to be preferred. That would be an
enormous error, as follows from all our theoretical views. There are cases =
in
which the greatest daring is the greatest wisdom.
</p>

<p>
Now in everything which is left to chance by the chief actor, his personal
merit, and therefore his responsibility as well, seems to be completely set
aside; nevertheless we cannot suppress an inward feeling of satisfaction
whenever expectation realises itself, and if it disappoints us our mind is
dissatisfied; and more than this of right and wrong should not be meant by =
the
judgment which we form from the mere result, or rather that we find there.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the satisfaction which our mind
experiences at success, the pain caused by failure, proceed from a sort of
mysterious feeling; we suppose between that success ascribed to good fortun=
e
and the genius of the chief a fine connecting thread, invisible to the
mind=E2=80=99s eye, and the supposition gives pleasure. What tends to confi=
rm
this idea is that our sympathy increases, becomes more decided, if the
successes and defeats of the principal actor are often repeated. Thus it
becomes intelligible how good luck in War assumes a much nobler nature than
good luck at play. In general, when a fortunate warrior does not otherwise
lessen our interest in his behalf, we have a pleasure in accompanying him i=
n
his career.
</p>

<p>
Criticism, therefore, after having weighed all that comes within the sphere=
 of
human reason and conviction, will let the result speak for that part where =
the
deep mysterious relations are not disclosed in any visible form, and will
protect this silent sentence of a higher authority from the noise of crude
opinions on the one hand, while on the other it prevents the gross abuse wh=
ich
might be made of this last tribunal.
</p>

<p>
This verdict of the result must therefore always bring forth that which hum=
an
sagacity cannot discover; and it will be chiefly as regards the intellectua=
l
powers and operations that it will be called into requisition, partly becau=
se
they can be estimated with the least certainty, partly because their close
connection with the will is favourable to their exercising over it an impor=
tant
influence. When fear or bravery precipitates the decision, there is nothing
objective intervening between them for our consideration, and consequently
nothing by which sagacity and calculation might have met the probable resul=
t.
</p>

<p>
We must now be allowed to make a few observations on the instrument of
criticism, that is, the language which it uses, because that is to a certai=
n
extent connected with the action in War; for the critical examination is
nothing more than the deliberation which should precede action in War. We
therefore think it very essential that the language used in criticism shoul=
d
have the same character as that which deliberation in War must have, for
otherwise it would cease to be practical, and criticism could gain no
admittance in actual life.
</p>

<p>
We have said in our observations on the theory of the conduct of War that i=
t
should educate the mind of the Commander for War, or that its teaching shou=
ld
guide his education; also that it is not intended to furnish him with posit=
ive
doctrines and systems which he can use like mental appliances. But if the
construction of scientific formulae is never required, or even allowable, i=
n
War to aid the decision on the case presented, if truth does not appear the=
re
in a systematic shape, if it is not found in an indirect way, but directly =
by
the natural perception of the mind, then it must be the same also in a crit=
ical
review.
</p>

<p>
It is true as we have seen that, wherever complete demonstration of the nat=
ure
of things would be too tedious, criticism must support itself on those trut=
hs
which theory has established on the point. But, just as in War the actor ob=
eys
these theoretical truths rather because his mind is imbued with them than
because he regards them as objective inflexible laws, so criticism must als=
o
make use of them, not as an external law or an algebraic formula, of which
fresh proof is not required each time they are applied, but it must always
throw a light on this proof itself, leaving only to theory the more minute =
and
circumstantial proof. Thus it avoids a mysterious, unintelligible phraseolo=
gy,
and makes its progress in plain language, that is, with a clear and always
visible chain of ideas.
</p>

<p>
Certainly this cannot always be completely attained, but it must always be =
the
aim in critical expositions. Such expositions must use complicated forms of
science as sparingly as possible, and never resort to the construction of
scientific aids as of a truth apparatus of its own, but always be guided by=
 the
natural and unbiassed impressions of the mind.
</p>

<p>
But this pious endeavour, if we may use the expression, has unfortunately
seldom hitherto presided over critical examinations: the most of them have
rather been emanations of a species of vanity=E2=80=94a wish to make a disp=
lay of
ideas.
</p>

<p>
The first evil which we constantly stumble upon is a lame, totally inadmiss=
ible
application of certain one-sided systems as of a formal code of laws. But i=
t is
never difficult to show the one-sidedness of such systems, and this only
requires to be done once to throw discredit for ever on critical judgments
which are based on them. We have here to deal with a definite subject, and =
as
the number of possible systems after all can be but small, therefore also t=
hey
are themselves the lesser evil.
</p>

<p>
Much greater is the evil which lies in the pompous retinue of technical
terms=E2=80=94scientific expressions and metaphors, which these systems car=
ry in
their train, and which like a rabble-like the baggage of an Army broken awa=
y
from its Chief=E2=80=94hang about in all directions. Any critic who has not
adopted a system, either because he has not found one to please him, or bec=
ause
he has not yet been able to make himself master of one, will at least
occasionally make use of a piece of one, as one would use a ruler, to show =
the
blunders committed by a General. The most of them are incapable of reasonin=
g
without using as a help here and there some shreds of scientific military
theory. The smallest of these fragments, consisting in mere scientific word=
s
and metaphors, are often nothing more than ornamental flourishes of critica=
l
narration. Now it is in the nature of things that all technical and scienti=
fic
expressions which belong to a system lose their propriety, if they ever had
any, as soon as they are distorted, and used as general axioms, or as small
crystalline talismans, which have more power of demonstration than simple
speech.
</p>

<p>
Thus it has come to pass that our theoretical and critical books, instead o=
f
being straightforward, intelligible dissertations, in which the author alwa=
ys
knows at least what he says and the reader what he reads, are brimful of th=
ese
technical terms, which form dark points of interference where author and re=
ader
part company. But frequently they are something worse, being nothing but ho=
llow
shells without any kernel. The author himself has no clear perception of wh=
at
he means, contents himself with vague ideas, which if expressed in plain
language would be unsatisfactory even to himself.
</p>

<p>
A third fault in criticism is the <i>misuse</i> of <i>historical examples</=
i>, and a display
of great reading or learning. What the history of the Art of War is we have
already said, and we shall further explain our views on examples and on
military history in general in special chapters. One fact merely touched up=
on
in a very cursory manner may be used to support the most opposite views, an=
d
three or four such facts of the most heterogeneous description, brought
together out of the most distant lands and remote times and heaped up,
generally distract and bewilder the judgment and understanding without
demonstrating anything; for when exposed to the light they turn out to be o=
nly
trumpery rubbish, made use of to show off the author=E2=80=99s learning.
</p>

<p>
But what can be gained for practical life by such obscure, partly false,
confused arbitrary conceptions? So little is gained that theory on account =
of
them has always been a true antithesis of practice, and frequently a subjec=
t of
ridicule to those whose soldierly qualities in the field are above question=
.
</p>

<p>
But it is impossible that this could have been the case, if theory in simpl=
e
language, and by natural treatment of those things which constitute the Art=
 of
making War, had merely sought to establish just so much as admits of being
established; if, avoiding all false pretensions and irrelevant display of
scientific forms and historical parallels, it had kept close to the subject=
,
and gone hand in hand with those who must conduct affairs in the field by t=
heir
own natural genius.

<h3><a name=3D"chap14"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>On Examples</h3>

<p>
Examples from history make everything clear, and furnish the best descripti=
on
of proof in the empirical sciences. This applies with more force to the Art=
 of
War than to any other. General Scharnhorst, whose handbook is the best ever
written on actual War, pronounces historical examples to be of the first
importance, and makes an admirable use of them himself. Had he survived the=
 War
in which he fell,(*) the fourth part of his revised treatise on artillery w=
ould
have given a still greater proof of the observing and enlightened spirit in
which he sifted matters of experience.
</p>

<p>
But such use of historical examples is rarely made by theoretical writers; =
the
way in which they more commonly make use of them is rather calculated to le=
ave
the mind unsatisfied, as well as to offend the understanding. We therefore
think it important to bring specially into view the use and abuse of histor=
ical
examples.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) General Scharnhorst died in 1813, of a wound received in the battle of
Bautzen or Grosz Gorchen=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<p>
Unquestionably the branches of knowledge which lie at the foundation of the=
 Art
of War come under the denomination of empirical sciences; for although they=
 are
derived in a great measure from the nature of things, still we can only lea=
rn
this very nature itself for the most part from experience; and besides that=
,
the practical application is modified by so many circumstances that the eff=
ects
can never be completely learnt from the mere nature of the means.
</p>

<p>
The effects of gunpowder, that great agent in our military activity, were o=
nly
learnt by experience, and up to this hour experiments are continually in
progress in order to investigate them more fully. That an iron ball to whic=
h
powder has given a velocity of 1000 feet in a second, smashes every living
thing which it touches in its course is intelligible in itself; experience =
is
not required to tell us that; but in producing this effect how many hundred
circumstances are concerned, some of which can only be learnt by experience=
!
And the physical is not the only effect which we have to study, it is the m=
oral
which we are in search of, and that can only be ascertained by experience; =
and
there is no other way of learning and appreciating it but by experience. In=
 the
middle ages, when firearms were first invented, their effect, owing to thei=
r
rude make, was materially but trifling compared to what it now is, but thei=
r
effect morally was much greater. One must have witnessed the firmness of on=
e of
those masses taught and led by Buonaparte, under the heaviest and most
unintermittent cannonade, in order to understand what troops, hardened by l=
ong
practice in the field of danger, can do, when by a career of victory they h=
ave
reached the noble principle of demanding from themselves their utmost effor=
ts.
In pure conception no one would believe it. On the other hand, it is well k=
nown
that there are troops in the service of European Powers at the present mome=
nt
who would easily be dispersed by a few cannon shots.
</p>

<p>
But no empirical science, consequently also no theory of the Art of War, ca=
n
always corroborate its truths by historical proof; it would also be, in som=
e
measure, difficult to support experience by single facts. If any means is o=
nce
found efficacious in War, it is repeated; one nation copies another, the th=
ing
becomes the fashion, and in this manner it comes into use, supported by
experience, and takes its place in theory, which contents itself with appea=
ling
to experience in general in order to show its origin, but not as a verifica=
tion
of its truth.
</p>

<p>
But it is quite otherwise if experience is to be used in order to overthrow
some means in use, to confirm what is doubtful, or introduce something new;
then particular examples from history must be quoted as proofs.
</p>

<p>
Now, if we consider closely the use of historical proofs, four points of vi=
ew
readily present themselves for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
First, they may be used merely as an <i>explanation</i> of an idea. In ever=
y abstract
consideration it is very easy to be misunderstood, or not to be intelligibl=
e at
all: when an author is afraid of this, an exemplification from history serv=
es
to throw the light which is wanted on his idea, and to ensure his being
intelligible to his reader.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, it may serve as an <i>application</i> of an idea, because by mean=
s of an
example there is an opportunity of showing the action of those minor
circumstances which cannot all be comprehended and explained in any general
expression of an idea; for in that consists, indeed, the difference between
theory and experience. Both these cases belong to examples properly speakin=
g,
the two following belong to historical proofs.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, a historical fact may be referred to particularly, in order to sup=
port
what one has advanced. This is in all cases sufficient, if we have <i>only<=
/i> to
prove the <i>possibility</i> of a fact or effect.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, in the fourth place, from the circumstantial detail of a historical
event, and by collecting together several of them, we may deduce some theor=
y,
which therefore has its true <i>proof</i> in this testimony itself.
</p>

<p>
For the first of these purposes all that is generally required is a cursory
notice of the case, as it is only used partially. Historical correctness is=
 a
secondary consideration; a case invented might also serve the purpose as we=
ll,
only historical ones are always to be preferred, because they bring the ide=
a
which they illustrate nearer to practical life.
</p>

<p>
The second use supposes a more circumstantial relation of events, but
historical authenticity is again of secondary importance, and in respect to
this point the same is to be said as in the first case.
</p>

<p>
For the third purpose the mere quotation of an undoubted fact is generally
sufficient. If it is asserted that fortified positions may fulfil their obj=
ect
under certain conditions, it is only necessary to mention the position of

<p>
But if, through the narrative of a case in history, an abstract truth is to=
 be
demonstrated, then everything in the case bearing on the demonstration must=
 be
analysed in the most searching and complete manner; it must, to a certain
extent, develop itself carefully before the eyes of the reader. The less
effectually this is done the weaker will be the proof, and the more necessa=
ry
it will be to supply the demonstrative proof which is wanting in the single
case by a number of cases, because we have a right to suppose that the more
minute details which we are unable to give neutralise each other in their
effects in a certain number of cases.
</p>

<p>
If we want to show by example derived from experience that cavalry are bett=
er
placed behind than in a line with infantry; that it is very hazardous witho=
ut a
decided preponderance of numbers to attempt an enveloping movement, with wi=
dely
separated columns, either on a field of battle or in the theatre of
war=E2=80=94that is, either tactically or strategically=E2=80=94then in the=
 first
of these cases it would not be sufficient to specify some lost battles in w=
hich
the cavalry was on the flanks and some gained in which the cavalry was in r=
ear
of the infantry; and in the tatter of these cases it is not sufficient to r=
efer
to the battles of Rivoli and Wagram, to the attack of the Austrians on the
theatre of war in Italy, in 1796, or of the French upon the German theatre =
of
war in the same year. The way in which these orders of battle or plans of
attack essentially contributed to disastrous issues in those particular cas=
es
must be shown by closely tracing out circumstances and occurrences. Then it
will appear how far such forms or measures are to be condemned, a point whi=
ch
it is very necessary to show, for a total condemnation would be inconsisten=
t
with truth.
</p>

<p>
It has been already said that when a circumstantial detail of facts is
impossible, the demonstrative power which is deficient may to a certain ext=
ent
be supplied by the number of cases quoted; but this is a very dangerous met=
hod
of getting out of the difficulty, and one which has been much abused. Inste=
ad
of one well-explained example, three or four are just touched upon, and thu=
s a
show is made of strong evidence. But there are matters where a whole dozen =
of
cases brought forward would prove nothing, if, for instance, they are facts=
 of
frequent occurrence, and therefore a dozen other cases with an opposite res=
ult
might just as easily be brought forward. If any one will instance a dozen l=
ost
battles in which the side beaten attacked in separate converging columns, w=
e
can instance a dozen that have been gained in which the same order was adop=
ted.
It is evident that in this way no result is to be obtained.
</p>

<p>
Upon carefully considering these different points, it will be seen how easi=
ly
examples may be misapplied.
</p>

<p>
An occurrence which, instead of being carefully analysed in all its parts, =
is
superficially noticed, is like an object seen at a great distance, presenti=
ng
the same appearance on each side, and in which the details of its parts can=
not
be distinguished. Such examples have, in reality, served to support the mos=
t
contradictory opinions. To some Daun=E2=80=99s campaigns are models of prud=
ence
and skill. To others, they are nothing but examples of timidity and want of
resolution. Buonaparte=E2=80=99s passage across the Noric Alps in 1797 may =
be
made to appear the noblest resolution, but also as an act of sheer temerity=
.
His strategic defeat in 1812 may be represented as the consequence either o=
f an
excess, or of a deficiency, of energy. All these opinions have been broache=
d,
and it is easy to see that they might very well arise, because each person
takes a different view of the connection of events. At the same time these
antagonistic opinions cannot be reconciled with each other, and therefore o=
ne
of the two must be wrong.
</p>

<p>
Much as we are obliged to the worthy Feuquieres for the numerous examples
introduced in his memoirs=E2=80=94partly because a number of historical inc=
idents
have thus been preserved which might otherwise have been lost, and partly
because he was one of the first to bring theoretical, that is, abstract, id=
eas
into connection with the practical in war, in so far that the cases brought
forward may be regarded as intended to exemplify and confirm what is
theoretically asserted=E2=80=94yet, in the opinion of an impartial reader, =
he
will hardly be allowed to have attained the object he proposed to himself, =
that
of proving theoretical principles by historical examples. For although he
sometimes relates occurrences with great minuteness, still he falls short v=
ery
often of showing that the deductions drawn necessarily proceed from the inn=
er
relations of these events.
</p>

<p>
Another evil which comes from the superficial notice of historical events, =
is
that some readers are either wholly ignorant of the events, or cannot call =
them
to remembrance sufficiently to be able to grasp the author=E2=80=99s meanin=
g, so
that there is no alternative between either accepting blindly what is said,=
 or
remaining unconvinced.
</p>

<p>
It is extremely difficult to put together or unfold historical events befor=
e
the eyes of a reader in such a way as is necessary, in order to be able to =
use
them as proofs; for the writer very often wants the means, and can neither
afford the time nor the requisite space; but we maintain that, when the obj=
ect
is to establish a new or doubtful opinion, one single example, thoroughly
analysed, is far more instructive than ten which are superficially treated.=
 The
great mischief of these superficial representations is not that the writer =
puts
his story forward as a proof when it has only a false title, but that he ha=
s
not made himself properly acquainted with the subject, and that from this s=
ort
of slovenly, shallow treatment of history, a hundred false views and attemp=
ts
at the construction of theories arise, which would never have made their
appearance if the writer had looked upon it as his duty to deduce from the
strict connection of events everything new which he brought to market, and
sought to prove from history.
</p>

<p>
When we are convinced of these difficulties in the use of historical exampl=
es,
and at the same time of the necessity (of making use of such examples), the=
n we
shall also come to the conclusion that the latest military history is natur=
ally
the best field from which to draw them, inasmuch as it alone is sufficientl=
y
authentic and detailed.
</p>

<p>
In ancient times, circumstances connected with War, as well as the method o=
f
carrying it on, were different; therefore its events are of less use to us
either theoretically or practically; in addition to which, military history=
,
like every other, naturally loses in the course of time a number of small
traits and lineaments originally to be seen, loses in colour and life, like=
 a
worn-out or darkened picture; so that perhaps at last only the large masses=
 and
leading features remain, which thus acquire undue proportions.
</p>

<p>
If we look at the present state of warfare, we should say that the Wars sin=
ce
that of the Austrian succession are almost the only ones which, at least as=
 far
as armament, have still a considerable similarity to the present, and which=
,
notwithstanding the many important changes which have taken place both grea=
t
and small, are still capable of affording much instruction. It is quite
otherwise with the War of the Spanish succession, as the use of fire-arms h=
ad
not then so far advanced towards perfection, and cavalry still continued th=
e
most important arm. The farther we go back, the less useful becomes militar=
y
history, as it gets so much the more meagre and barren of detail. The most
useless of all is that of the old world.
</p>

<p>
But this uselessness is not altogether absolute, it relates only to those
subjects which depend on a knowledge of minute details, or on those things =
in
which the method of conducting war has changed. Although we know very littl=
e
about the tactics in the battles between the Swiss and the Austrians, the
Burgundians and French, still we find in them unmistakable evidence that th=
ey
were the first in which the superiority of a good infantry over the best
cavalry was, displayed. A general glance at the time of the Condottieri tea=
ches
us how the whole method of conducting War is dependent on the instrument us=
ed;
for at no period have the forces used in War had so much the characteristic=
s of
a special instrument, and been a class so totally distinct from the rest of=
 the
national community. The memorable way in which the Romans in the second Pun=
ic
War attacked the Carthaginan possessions in Spain and Africa, while Hanniba=
l
still maintained himself in Italy, is a most instructive subject to study, =
as
the general relations of the States and Armies concerned in this indirect a=
ct
of defence are sufficiently well known.
</p>

<p>
But the more things descend into particulars and deviate in character from =
the
most general relations, the less we can look for examples and lessons of
experience from very remote periods, for we have neither the means of judgi=
ng
properly of corresponding events, nor can we apply them to our completely
different method of War.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, however, it has always been the fashion with historical writ=
ers
to talk about ancient times. We shall not say how far vanity and charlatani=
sm
may have had a share in this, but in general we fail to discover any honest
intention and earnest endeavour to instruct and convince, and we can theref=
ore
only look upon such quotations and references as embellishments to fill up =
gaps
and hide defects.
</p>

<p>
It would be an immense service to teach the Art of War entirely by historic=
al
examples, as Feuquieres proposed to do; but it would be full work for the w=
hole
life of a man, if we reflect that he who undertakes it must first qualify
himself for the task by a long personal experience in actual War.
</p>

<p>
Whoever, stirred by ambition, undertakes such a task, let him prepare himse=
lf
for his pious undertaking as for a long pilgrimage; let him give up his tim=
e,
spare no sacrifice, fear no temporal rank or power, and rise above all feel=
ings
of personal vanity, of false shame, in order, according to the French code,=
 to
speak <i>the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.</i>

<h3><a name=3D"part03"></a>BOOK III.<br>OF STRATEGY IN GENERAL</h3>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap15"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>Strategy</h3>

<p>
In the second chapter of the second book, Strategy has been defined as
=E2=80=9Cthe employment of the battle as the means towards the attainment o=
f the
object of the War.=E2=80=9D Properly speaking it has to do with nothing but=
 the
battle, but its theory must include in this consideration the instrument of
this real activity=E2=80=94the armed force=E2=80=94in itself and in its pri=
ncipal
relations, for the battle is fought by it, and shows its effects upon it in
turn. It must be well acquainted with the battle itself as far as relates t=
o
its possible results, and those mental and moral powers which are the most
important in the use of the same.
</p>

<p>
Strategy is the employment of the battle to gain the end of the War; it mus=
t
therefore give an aim to the whole military action, which must be in accord=
ance
with the object of the War; in other words, Strategy forms the plan of the =
War,
and to this end it links together the series of acts which are to lead to t=
he
final decision, that, is to say, it makes the plans for the separate campai=
gns
and regulates the combats to be fought in each. As these are all things whi=
ch
to a great extent can only be determined on conjectures some of which turn =
out
incorrect, while a number of other arrangements pertaining to details canno=
t be
made at all beforehand, it follows, as a matter of course, that Strategy mu=
st
go with the Army to the field in order to arrange particulars on the spot, =
and
to make the modifications in the general plan, which incessantly become
necessary in War. Strategy can therefore never take its hand from the work =
for
a moment.
</p>

<p>
That this, however, has not always been the view taken is evident from the
former custom of keeping Strategy in the cabinet and not with the Army, a t=
hing
only allowable if the cabinet is so near to the Army that it can be taken f=
or
the chief head-quarters of the Army.
</p>

<p>
Theory will therefore attend on Strategy in the determination of its plans,=
 or,
as we may more properly say, it will throw a light on things in themselves,=
 and
on their relations to each other, and bring out prominently the little that
there is of principle or rule.
</p>

<p>
If we recall to mind from the first chapter how many things of the highest
importance War touches upon, we may conceive that a consideration of all
requires a rare grasp of mind.
</p>

<p>
A Prince or General who knows exactly how to organise his War according to =
his
object and means, who does neither too little nor too much, gives by that t=
he
greatest proof of his genius. But the effects of this talent are exhibited =
not
so much by the invention of new modes of action, which might strike the eye
immediately, as in the successful final result of the whole. It is the exac=
t
fulfilment of silent suppositions, it is the noiseless harmony of the whole
action which we should admire, and which only makes itself known in the tot=
al
result. Inquirer who, tracing back from the final result, does not perceive=
 the
signs of that harmony is one who is apt to seek for genius where it is not,=
 and
where it cannot be found.
</p>

<p>
The means and forms which Strategy uses are in fact so extremely simple, so
well known by their constant repetition, that it only appears ridiculous to
sound common sense when it hears critics so frequently speaking of them wit=
h
high-flown emphasis. Turning a flank, which has been done a thousand times,=
 is
regarded here as a proof of the most brilliant genius, there as a proof of =
the
most profound penetration, indeed even of the most comprehensive knowledge.=
 Can
there be in the book-world more absurd productions?(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) This paragraph refers to the works of Lloyd, B=C3=BClow, indeed to all =
the
eighteenth-century writers, from whose influence we in England are not even=
 yet
free.=E2=80=94ED.
</p>

<p>
It is still more ridiculous if, in addition to this, we reflect that the sa=
me
critic, in accordance with prevalent opinion, excludes all moral forces fro=
m
theory, and will not allow it to be concerned with anything but the materia=
l
forces, so that all must be confined to a few mathematical relations of
equilibrium and preponderance, of time and space, and a few lines and angle=
s.
If it were nothing more than this, then out of such a miserable business th=
ere
would not be a scientific problem for even a schoolboy.
</p>

<p>
But let us admit: there is no question here about scientific formulas and
problems; the relations of material things are all very simple; the right
comprehension of the moral forces which come into play is more difficult.
Still, even in respect to them, it is only in the highest branches of Strat=
egy
that moral complications and a great diversity of quantities and relations =
are
to be looked for, only at that point where Strategy borders on political
science, or rather where the two become one, and there, as we have before
observed, they have more influence on the =E2=80=9Chow much=E2=80=9D and =
=E2=80=9Chow
little=E2=80=9D is to be done than on the form of execution. Where the latt=
er is
the principal question, as in the single acts both great and small in War, =
the
moral quantities are already reduced to a very small number.
</p>

<p>
Thus, then, in Strategy everything is very simple, but not on that account =
very
easy. Once it is determined from the relations of the State what should and=
 may
be done by War, then the way to it is easy to find; but to follow that way
straightforward, to carry out the plan without being obliged to deviate fro=
m it
a thousand times by a thousand varying influences, requires, besides great
strength of character, great clearness and steadiness of mind, and out of a
thousand men who are remarkable, some for mind, others for penetration, oth=
ers
again for boldness or strength of will, perhaps not one will combine in him=
self
all those qualities which are required to raise a man above mediocrity in t=
he
career of a general.
</p>

<p>
It may sound strange, but for all who know War in this respect it is a fact
beyond doubt, that much more strength of will is required to make an import=
ant
decision in Strategy than in tactics. In the latter we are hurried on with =
the
moment; a Commander feels himself borne along in a strong current, against
which he durst not contend without the most destructive consequences, he
suppresses the rising fears, and boldly ventures further. In Strategy, wher=
e
all goes on at a slower rate, there is more room allowed for our own
apprehensions and those of others, for objections and remonstrances,
consequently also for unseasonable regrets; and as we do not see things in
Strategy as we do at least half of them in tactics, with the living eye, bu=
t
everything must be conjectured and assumed, the convictions produced are le=
ss
powerful. The consequence is that most Generals, when they should act, rema=
in
stuck fast in bewildering doubts.
</p>

<p>
Now let us cast a glance at history=E2=80=94upon Frederick the Great=E2=80=
=99s
campaign of 1760, celebrated for its fine marches and man=C5=93uvres: a per=
fect
masterpiece of Strategic skill as critics tell us. Is there really anything=
 to
drive us out of our wits with admiration in the King=E2=80=99s first trying=
 to
turn Daun=E2=80=99s right flank, then his left, then again his right, &amp;=
c.?
Are we to see profound wisdom in this? No, that we cannot, if we are to dec=
ide
naturally and without affectation. What we rather admire above all is the
sagacity of the King in this respect, that while pursuing a great object wi=
th
very limited means, he undertook nothing beyond his powers, and <i>just eno=
ugh</i> to
gain his object. This sagacity of the General is visible not only in this
campaign, but throughout all the three Wars of the Great King!
</p>

<p>
To bring Silesia into the safe harbour of a well-guaranteed peace was his
object.
</p>

<p>
At the head of a small State, which was like other States in most things, a=
nd
only ahead of them in some branches of administration; he could not be an
Alexander, and, as Charles XII, he would only, like him, have broken his he=
ad.
We find, therefore, in the whole of his conduct of War, a controlled power,
always well balanced, and never wanting in energy, which in the most critic=
al
moments rises to astonishing deeds, and the next moment oscillates quietly =
on
again in subordination to the play of the most subtle political influences.
Neither vanity, thirst for glory, nor vengeance could make him deviate from=
 his
course, and this course alone it is which brought him to a fortunate
termination of the contest.
</p>

<p>
These few words do but scant justice to this phase of the genius of the gre=
at
General; the eyes must be fixed carefully on the extraordinary issue of the
struggle, and the causes which brought about that issue must be traced out,=
 in
order thoroughly to understand that nothing but the King=E2=80=99s penetrat=
ing
eye brought him safely out of all his dangers.
</p>

<p>
This is one feature in this great Commander which we admire in the campaign=
 of
1760=E2=80=94and in all others, but in this especially=E2=80=94because in n=
one did
he keep the balance even against such a superior hostile force, with such a
small sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Another feature relates to the difficulty of execution. Marches to turn a
flank, right or left, are easily combined; the idea of keeping a small forc=
e
always well concentrated to be able to meet the enemy on equal terms at any
point, to multiply a force by rapid movement, is as easily conceived as
expressed; the mere contrivance in these points, therefore, cannot excite o=
ur
admiration, and with respect to such simple things, there is nothing furthe=
r
than to admit that they are simple.
</p>

<p>
But let a General try to do these things like Frederick the Great. Long
afterwards authors, who were eyewitnesses, have spoken of the danger, indee=
d of
the imprudence, of the King=E2=80=99s camps, and doubtless, at the time he
pitched them, the danger appeared three times as great as afterwards.
</p>

<p>
It was the same with his marches, under the eyes, nay, often under the cann=
on
of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army; these camps were taken up, these marches made,=
 not
from want of prudence, but because in Daun=E2=80=99s system, in his mode of
drawing up his Army, in the responsibility which pressed upon him, and in h=
is
character, Frederick found that security which justified his camps and marc=
hes.
But it required the King=E2=80=99s boldness, determination, and strength of=
 will
to see things in this light, and not to be led astray and intimidated by th=
e
danger of which thirty years after people still wrote and spoke. Few Genera=
ls
in this situation would have believed these simple strategic means to be
practicable.
</p>

<p>
Again, another difficulty in execution lay in this, that the King=E2=80=99s=
 Army
in this campaign was constantly in motion. Twice it marched by wretched
cross-roads, from the Elbe into Silesia, in rear of Daun and pursued by Las=
cy
(beginning of July, beginning of August). It required to be always ready fo=
r
battle, and its marches had to be organised with a degree of skill which
necessarily called forth a proportionate amount of exertion. Although atten=
ded
and delayed by thousands of waggons, still its subsistence was extremely
difficult. In Silesia, for eight days before the battle of Leignitz, it had
constantly to march, defiling alternately right and left in front of the
enemy:=E2=80=94this costs great fatigue, and entails great privations.
</p>

<p>
Is it to be supposed that all this could have been done without producing g=
reat
friction in the machine? Can the mind of a Commander elaborate such movemen=
ts
with the same ease as the hand of a land surveyor uses the astrolabe? Does =
not
the sight of the sufferings of their hungry, thirsty comrades pierce the he=
arts
of the Commander and his Generals a thousand times? Must not the murmurs an=
d
doubts which these cause reach his ear? Has an ordinary man the courage to
demand such sacrifices, and would not such efforts most certainly demoralis=
e
the Army, break up the bands of discipline, and, in short, undermine its
military virtue, if firm reliance on the greatness and infallibility of the
Commander did not compensate for all? Here, therefore, it is that we should=
 pay
respect; it is these miracles of execution which we should admire. But it i=
s
impossible to realise all this in its full force without a foretaste of it =
by
experience. He who only knows War from books or the drill-ground cannot rea=
lise
the whole effect of this counterpoise in action; <i>we beg him, therefore, =
to
accept from us on faith and trust all that he is unable to supply from any
personal experiences of his own.</i>
</p>

<p>
This illustration is intended to give more clearness to the course of our
ideas, and in closing this chapter we will only briefly observe that in our
exposition of Strategy we shall describe those separate subjects which appe=
ar
to us the most important, whether of a moral or material nature; then proce=
ed
from the simple to the complex, and conclude with the inner connection of t=
he
whole act of War, in other words, with the plan for a War or campaign.
</p>

<h4>
OBSERVATION.
</h4>

<p class=3D"letter">
In an earlier manuscript of the second book are the following passages endo=
rsed
by the author himself <i>to be used for the first Chapter of the second Boo=
k:</i> the
projected revision of that chapter not having been made, the passages refer=
red
to are introduced here in full.
</p>

<p>
By the mere assemblage of armed forces at a particular point, a battle ther=
e
becomes possible, but does not always take place. Is that possibility now t=
o be
regarded as a reality and therefore an effective thing? Certainly, it is so=
 by
its results, and these effects, whatever they may be, can never fail.
</p>

<h4>
1. POSSIBLE COMBATS ARE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR RESULTS TO BE LOOKED UPON AS RE=
AL
ONES.
</h4>

<p>
If a detachment is sent away to cut off the retreat of a flying enemy, and =
the
enemy surrenders in consequence without further resistance, still it is thr=
ough
the combat which is offered to him by this detachment sent after him that h=
e is
brought to his decision.
</p>

<p>
If a part of our Army occupies an enemy=E2=80=99s province which was undefe=
nded,
and thus deprives the enemy of very considerable means of keeping up the
strength of his Army, it is entirely through the battle which our detached =
body
gives the enemy to expect, in case he seeks to recover the lost province, t=
hat
we remain in possession of the same.
</p>

<p>
In both cases, therefore, the mere possibility of a battle has produced
results, and is therefore to be classed amongst actual events. Suppose that=
 in
these cases the enemy has opposed our troops with others superior in force,=
 and
thus forced ours to give up their object without a combat, then certainly o=
ur
plan has failed, but the battle which we offered at (either of) those point=
s
has not on that account been without effect, for it attracted the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
forces to that point. And in case our whole undertaking has done us harm, i=
t
cannot be said that these positions, these possible battles, have been atte=
nded
with no results; their effects, then, are similar to those of a lost battle=
.
</p>

<p>
In this manner we see that the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s military
forces, the overthrow of the enemy=E2=80=99s power, is only to be done thro=
ugh
the effect of a battle, whether it be that it actually takes place, or that=
 it
is merely offered, and not accepted.
</p>

<h4>
2. TWOFOLD OBJECT OF THE COMBAT.
</h4>

<p>
But these effects are of two kinds, direct and indirect they are of the lat=
ter,
if other things intrude themselves and become the object of the
combat=E2=80=94things which cannot be regarded as the destruction of
enemy=E2=80=99s force, but only leading up to it, certainly by a circuitous=
 road,
but with so much the greater effect. The possession of provinces, towns,
fortresses, roads, bridges, magazines, &amp;c., may be the <i>immediate</i>=
 object of
a battle, but never the ultimate one. Things of this description can never =
be,
looked upon otherwise than as means of gaining greater superiority, so as a=
t
last to offer battle to the enemy in such a way that it will be impossible =
for
him to accept it. Therefore all these things must only be regarded as
intermediate links, steps, as it were, leading up to the effectual principl=
e,
but never as that principle itself.

3. EXAMPLE.
</h4>

<p>
In 1814, by the capture of Buonaparte=E2=80=99s capital the object of the W=
ar was
attained. The political divisions which had their roots in Paris came into
active operation, and an enormous split left the power of the Emperor to
collapse of itself. Nevertheless the point of view from which we must look =
at
all this is, that through these causes the forces and defensive means of
Buonaparte were suddenly very much diminished, the superiority of the Allie=
s,
therefore, just in the same measure increased, and any further resistance t=
hen
became <i>impossible</i>. It was this impossibility which produced the peac=
e with
France. If we suppose the forces of the Allies at that moment diminished to=
 a
like extent through external causes;=E2=80=94if the superiority vanishes, t=
hen at
the same time vanishes also all the effect and importance of the taking of
Paris.
</p>

<p>
We have gone through this chain of argument in order to show that this is t=
he
natural and only true view of the thing from which it derives its importanc=
e.
It leads always back to the question, What at any given moment of the War o=
r
campaign will be the probable result of the great or small combats which th=
e
two sides might offer to each other? In the consideration of a plan for a
campaign, this question only is decisive as to the measures which are to be
taken all through from the very commencement.
</p>

<h4>
4. WHEN THIS VIEW IS NOT TAKEN, THEN A FALSE VALUE IS GIVEN TO OTHER THINGS=
.
</h4>

<p>
If we do not accustom ourselves to look upon War, and the single campaigns =
in a
War, as a chain which is all composed of battles strung together, one of wh=
ich
always brings on another; if we adopt the idea that the taking of a certain
geographical point, the occupation of an undefended province, is in itself
anything; then we are very likely to regard it as an acquisition which we m=
ay
retain; and if we look at it so, and not as a term in the whole series of
events, we do not ask ourselves whether this possession may not lead to gre=
ater
disadvantages hereafter. How often we find this mistake recurring in milita=
ry
history.
</p>

<p>
We might say that, just as in commerce the merchant cannot set apart and pl=
ace
in security gains from one single transaction by itself, so in War a single
advantage cannot be separated from the result of the whole. Just as the for=
mer
must always operate with the whole bulk of his means, just so in War, only =
the
sum total will decide on the advantage or disadvantage of each item.
</p>

<p>
If the mind=E2=80=99s eye is always directed upon the series of combats, so=
 far
as they can be seen beforehand, then it is always looking in the right
direction, and thereby the motion of the force acquires that rapidity, that=
 is
to say, willing and doing acquire that energy which is suitable to the matt=
er,
and which is not to be thwarted or turned aside by extraneous influences.(*=

<h3><a name=3D"chap16"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>Elements of Strategy</h3>

<p>
The causes which condition the use of the combat in Strategy may be easily
divided into elements of different kinds, such as the moral, physical,
mathematical, geographical and statistical elements.
</p>

<p>
The first class includes all that can be called forth by moral qualities an=
d
effects; to the second belong the whole mass of the military force, its
organisation, the proportion of the three arms, &amp;c. &amp;c.; to the thi=
rd,
the angle of the lines of operation, the concentric and eccentric movements=
 in
as far as their geometrical nature has any value in the calculation; to the
fourth, the influences of country, such as commanding points, hills, rivers=
,
woods, roads, &amp;c. &amp;c.; lastly, to the fifth, all the means of suppl=
y.
The separation of these things once for all in the mind does good in giving
clearness and helping us to estimate at once, at a higher or lower value, t=
he
different classes as we pass onwards. For, in considering them separately, =
many
lose of themselves their borrowed importance; one feels, for instance, quit=
e
plainly that the value of a base of operations, even if we look at nothing =
in
it but its relative position to the line of operations, depends much less i=
n
that simple form on the geometrical element of the angle which they form wi=
th
one another, than on the nature of the roads and the country through which =
they
pass.
</p>

<p>
But to treat upon Strategy according to these elements would be the most
unfortunate idea that could be conceived, for these elements are generally
manifold, and intimately connected with each other in every single operatio=
n of
War. We should lose ourselves in the most soulless analysis, and as if in a
horrid dream, we should be for ever trying in vain to build up an arch to
connect this base of abstractions with facts belonging to the real world.
Heaven preserve every theorist from such an undertaking! We shall keep to t=
he
world of things in their totality, and not pursue our analysis further than=
 is
necessary from time to time to give distinctness to the idea which we wish =
to
impart, and which has come to us, not by a speculative investigation, but
through the impression made by the realities of War in their entirety.

<h3><a name=3D"chap17"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>Moral Forces</h3>

<p>
We must return again to this subject, which is touched upon in the third
chapter of the second book, because the moral forces are amongst the most
important subjects in War. They form the spirit which permeates the whole b=
eing
of War. These forces fasten themselves soonest and with the greatest affini=
ty
on to the Will which puts in motion and guides the whole mass of powers,
uniting with it as it were in one stream, because this is a moral force its=
elf.
Unfortunately they will escape from all book-analysis, for they will neithe=
r be
brought into numbers nor into classes, and require to be both seen and felt=
.
</p>

<p>
The spirit and other moral qualities which animate an Army, a General, or
Governments, public opinion in provinces in which a War is raging, the mora=
l
effect of a victory or of a defeat, are things which in themselves vary ver=
y
much in their nature, and which also, according as they stand with regard t=
o
our object and our relations, may have an influence in different ways.
</p>

<p>
Although little or nothing can be said about these things in books, still t=
hey
belong to the theory of the Art of War, as much as everything else which
constitutes War. For I must here once more repeat that it is a miserable
philosophy if, according to the old plan, we establish rules and principles
wholly regardless of all moral forces, and then, as soon as these forces ma=
ke
their appearance, we begin to count exceptions which we thereby establish a=
s it
were theoretically, that is, make into rules; or if we resort to an appeal =
to
genius, which is above all rules, thus giving out by implication, not only =
that
rules were only made for fools, but also that they themselves are no better
than folly.
</p>

<p>
Even if the theory of the Art of War does no more in reality than recall th=
ese
things to remembrance, showing the necessity of allowing to the moral force=
s
their full value, and of always taking them into consideration, by so doing=
 it
extends its borders over the region of immaterial forces, and by establishi=
ng
that point of view, condemns beforehand every one who would endeavour to
justify himself before its judgment seat by the mere physical relations of
forces.
</p>

<p>
Further out of regard to all other so-called rules, theory cannot banish th=
e
moral forces beyond its frontier, because the effects of the physical force=
s
and the moral are completely fused, and are not to be decomposed like a met=
al
alloy by a chemical process. In every rule relating to the physical forces,
theory must present to the mind at the same time the share which the moral
powers will have in it, if it would not be led to categorical propositions,=
 at
one time too timid and contracted, at another too dogmatical and wide. Even=
 the
most matter-of-fact theories have, without knowing it, strayed over into th=
is
moral kingdom; for, as an example, the effects of a victory cannot in any w=
ay
be explained without taking into consideration the moral impressions. And
therefore the most of the subjects which we shall go through in this book a=
re
composed half of physical, half of moral causes and effects, and we might s=
ay
the physical are almost no more than the wooden handle, whilst the moral ar=
e
the noble metal, the real bright-polished weapon.
</p>

<p>
The value of the moral powers, and their frequently incredible influence, a=
re
best exemplified by history, and this is the most generous and the purest
nourishment which the mind of the General can extract from it.=E2=80=94At t=
he
same time it is to be observed, that it is less demonstrations, critical
examinations, and learned treatises, than sentiments, general impressions, =
and
single flashing sparks of truth, which yield the seeds of knowledge that ar=
e to
fertilise the mind.
</p>

<p>
We might go through the most important moral phenomena in War, and with all=
 the
care of a diligent professor try what we could impart about each, either go=
od
or bad. But as in such a method one slides too much into the commonplace an=
d
trite, whilst real mind quickly makes its escape in analysis, the end is th=
at
one gets imperceptibly to the relation of things which everybody knows. We
prefer, therefore, to remain here more than usually incomplete and rhapsodi=
cal,
content to have drawn attention to the importance of the subject in a gener=
al
way, and to have pointed out the spirit in which the views given in this bo=
ok
have been conceived.

<h3><a name=3D"chap18"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>The Chief Moral Powers</h3>

<p>
These are <i>The Talents of the Commander; The Military Virtue of the Army;=
 Its
National feeling</i>. Which of these is the most important no one can tell =
in a
general way, for it is very difficult to say anything in general of their
strength, and still more difficult to compare the strength of one with that=
 of
another. The best plan is not to undervalue any of them, a fault which huma=
n
judgment is prone to, sometimes on one side, sometimes on another, in its
whimsical oscillations. It is better to satisfy ourselves of the undeniable
efficacy of these three things by sufficient evidence from history.
</p>

<p>
It is true, however, that in modern times the Armies of European states hav=
e
arrived very much at a par as regards discipline and fitness for service, a=

that the conduct of War has=E2=80=94as philosophers would say=E2=80=94natur=

developed itself, thereby become a method, common as it were to all Armies,=
 so
that even from Commanders there is nothing further to be expected in the wa=
y of
application of special means of Art, in the limited sense (such as Frederic=
k
the Second=E2=80=99s oblique order). Hence it cannot be denied that, as mat=

now stand, greater scope is afforded for the influence of National spirit a=

<p>
The national spirit of an Army (enthusiasm, fanatical zeal, faith, opinion)
displays itself most in mountain warfare, where every one down to the commo=
n
soldier is left to himself. On this account, a mountainous country is the b=
est
campaigning ground for popular levies.
</p>

<p>
Expertness of an Army through training, and that well-tempered courage whic=
h
holds the ranks together as if they had been cast in a mould, show their
superiority in an open country.
</p>

<p>
The talent of a General has most room to display itself in a closely
intersected, undulating country. In mountains he has too little command ove=
r
the separate parts, and the direction of all is beyond his powers; in open
plains it is simple and does not exceed those powers.

<h3><a name=3D"chap19"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Military Virtue of an Army</h3>

<p>
This is distinguished from mere bravery, and still more from enthusiasm for=
 the
business of War. The first is certainly a necessary constituent part of it,=
 but
in the same way as bravery, which is a natural gift in some men, may arise =
in a
soldier as a part of an Army from habit and custom, so with him it must als=
o
have a different direction from that which it has with others. It must lose
that impulse to unbridled activity and exercise of force which is its
characteristic in the individual, and submit itself to demands of a higher
kind, to obedience, order, rule, and method. Enthusiasm for the profession
gives life and greater fire to the military virtue of an Army, but does not
necessarily constitute a part of it.
</p>

<p>
War is a special business, and however general its relations may be, and ev=
en
if all the male population of a country, capable of bearing arms, exercise =
this
calling, still it always continues to be different and separate from the ot=
her
pursuits which occupy the life of man.=E2=80=94To be imbued with a sense of=
 the
spirit and nature of this business, to make use of, to rouse, to assimilate
into the system the powers which should be active in it, to penetrate
completely into the nature of the business with the understanding, through
exercise to gain confidence and expertness in it, to be completely given up=
 to
it, to pass out of the man into the part which it is assigned to us to play=
 in
War, that is the military virtue of an Army in the individual.
</p>

<p>
However much pains may be taken to combine the soldier and the citizen in o=
ne
and the same individual, whatever may be done to nationalise Wars, and howe=
ver
much we may imagine times have changed since the days of the old Condottier=
i,
never will it be possible to do away with the individuality of the business=
;
and if that cannot be done, then those who belong to it, as long as they be=
long
to it, will always look upon themselves as a kind of guild, in the regulati=
ons,
laws and customs in which the =E2=80=9CSpirit of War=E2=80=9D by preference=
 finds
its expression. And so it is in fact. Even with the most decided inclinatio=
n to
look at War from the highest point of view, it would be very wrong to look =
down
upon this corporate spirit (<i>esprit de corps</i>) which may and should ex=
ist
more or less in every Army. This corporate spirit forms the bond of union
between the natural forces which are active in that which we have called
military virtue. The crystals of military virtue have a greater affinity fo=
r
the spirit of a corporate body than for anything else.
</p>

<p>
An Army which preserves its usual formations under the heaviest fire, which=
 is
never shaken by imaginary fears, and in the face of real danger disputes th=
e
ground inch by inch, which, proud in the feeling of its victories, never lo=
ses
its sense of obedience, its respect for and confidence in its leaders, even
under the depressing effects of defeat; an Army with all its physical power=
s,
inured to privations and fatigue by exercise, like the muscles of an athlet=
e;
an Army which looks upon all its toils as the means to victory, not as a cu=
rse
which hovers over its standards, and which is always reminded of its duties=
 and
virtues by the short catechism of one idea, namely the <i>honour of its
arms;</i>=E2=80=94Such an Army is imbued with the true military spirit.
</p>

<p>
Soldiers may fight bravely like the Vend=C3=A9ans, and do great things like
the Swiss, the Americans, or Spaniards, without displaying this military
virtue. A Commander may also be successful at the head of standing Armies, =
like
Eugene and Marlborough, without enjoying the benefit of its assistance; we =
must
not, therefore, say that a successful War without it cannot be imagined; an=
d we
draw especial attention to that point, in order the more to individualise t=
he
conception which is here brought forward, that the idea may not dissolve in=
to a
generalisation and that it may not be thought that military virtue is in th=
e
end everything. It is not so. Military virtue in an Army is a definite mora=
l
power which may be supposed wanting, and the influence of which may therefo=
re
be estimated=E2=80=94like any instrument the power of which may be calculat=
ed.
</p>

<p>
Having thus characterised it, we proceed to consider what can be predicated=
 of
its influence, and what are the means of gaining its assistance.
</p>

<p>
Military virtue is for the parts, what the genius of the Commander is for t=
he
whole. The General can only guide the whole, not each separate part, and wh=
ere
he cannot guide the part, there military virtue must be its leader. A Gener=
al
is chosen by the reputation of his superior talents, the chief leaders of l=
arge
masses after careful probation; but this probation diminishes as we descend=
 the
scale of rank, and in just the same measure we may reckon less and less upo=
n
individual talents; but what is wanting in this respect military virtue sho=
uld
supply. The natural qualities of a warlike people play just this part: <i>b=
ravery,
aptitude, powers of endurance</i> and <i>enthusiasm.</i>
</p>

<p>
These properties may therefore supply the place of military virtue, and <i>=
vice
versa</i>, from which the following may be deduced:
</p>

<p>
1. Military virtue is a quality of standing Armies only, but they require i=
t
the most. In national risings its place is supplied by natural qualities, w=
hich
develop themselves there more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
2. Standing Armies opposed to standing Armies, can more easily dispense wit=
h
it, than a standing Army opposed to a national insurrection, for in that ca=
se,
the troops are more scattered, and the divisions left more to themselves. B=
ut
where an Army can be kept concentrated, the genius of the General takes a
greater place, and supplies what is wanting in the spirit of the Army.
Therefore generally military virtue becomes more necessary the more the the=
atre
of operations and other circumstances make the War complicated, and cause t=
he
forces to be scattered.
</p>

<p>
From these truths the only lesson to be derived is this, that if an Army is
deficient in this quality, every endeavour should be made to simplify the
operations of the War as much as possible, or to introduce double efficienc=
y in
the organisation of the Army in some other respect, and not to expect from =
the
mere name of a standing Army, that which only the veritable thing itself ca=
n
give.
</p>

<p>
The military virtue of an Army is, therefore, one of the most important mor=
al
powers in War, and where it is wanting, we either see its place supplied by=
 one
of the others, such as the great superiority of generalship or popular
enthusiasm, or we find the results not commensurate with the exertions
made.=E2=80=94How much that is great, this spirit, this sterling worth of a=
n
army, this refining of ore into the polished metal, has already done, we se=
e in
the history of the Macedonians under Alexander, the Roman legions under Ces=
ar,
the Spanish infantry under Alexander Farnese, the Swedes under Gustavus
Adolphus and Charles XII, the Prussians under Frederick the Great, and the
French under Buonaparte. We must purposely shut our eyes against all histor=
ical
proof, if we do not admit, that the astonishing successes of these Generals=
 and
their greatness in situations of extreme difficulty, were only possible wit=
h
Armies possessing this virtue.
</p>

<p>
This spirit can only be generated from two sources, and only by these two
conjointly; the first is a succession of campaigns and great victories; the
other is, an activity of the Army carried sometimes to the highest pitch. O=
nly
by these, does the soldier learn to know his powers. The more a General is =
in
the habit of demanding from his troops, the surer he will be that his deman=
ds
will be answered. The soldier is as proud of overcoming toil, as he is of
surmounting danger. Therefore it is only in the soil of incessant activity =
and
exertion that the germ will thrive, but also only in the sunshine of victor=
y.
Once it becomes a <i>strong tree</i>, it will stand against the fiercest st=
orms of
misfortune and defeat, and even against the indolent inactivity of peace, a=
t
least for a time. It can therefore only be created in War, and under great
Generals, but no doubt it may last at least for several generations, even u=
nder
Generals of moderate capacity, and through considerable periods of peace.
</p>

<p>
With this generous and noble spirit of union in a line of veteran troops,
covered with scars and thoroughly inured to War, we must not compare the
self-esteem and vanity of a standing Army,(*) held together merely by the g=
lue
of service-regulations and a drill book; a certain plodding earnestness and
strict discipline may keep up military virtue for a long time, but can neve=
r
create it; these things therefore have a certain value, but must not be
over-rated. Order, smartness, good will, also a certain degree of pride and
high feeling, are qualities of an Army formed in time of peace which are to=
 be
prized, but cannot stand alone. The whole retains the whole, and as with gl=
ass
too quickly cooled, a single crack breaks the whole mass. Above all, the
highest spirit in the world changes only too easily at the first check into
depression, and one might say into a kind of rhodomontade of alarm, the Fre=
nch
<i>sauve que peut</i>.=E2=80=94Such an Army can only achieve something thro=
ugh its
leader, never by itself. It must be led with double caution, until by degre=
es,
in victory and hardships, the strength grows into the full armour. Beware t=
hen
of confusing the SPIRIT of an Army with its temper.

<h3><a name=3D"chap20"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>Boldness</h3>

<p>
The place and part which boldness takes in the dynamic system of powers, wh=
ere
it stands opposed to Foresight and prudence, has been stated in the chapter=
 on
the certainty of the result in order thereby to show, that theory has no ri=
ght
to restrict it by virtue of its legislative power.
</p>

<p>
But this noble impulse, with which the human soul raises itself above the m=
ost
formidable dangers, is to be regarded as an active principle peculiarly
belonging to War. In fact, in what branch of human activity should boldness
have a right of citizenship if not in War?
</p>

<p>
From the transport-driver and the drummer up to the General, it is the nobl=
est
of virtues, the true steel which gives the weapon its edge and brilliancy.
</p>

<p>
Let us admit in fact it has in War even its own prerogatives. Over and abov=
e
the result of the calculation of space, time, and quantity, we must allow a
certain percentage which boldness derives from the weakness of others, when=
ever
it gains the mastery. It is therefore, virtually, a creative power. This is=
 not
difficult to demonstrate philosophically. As often as boldness encounters
hesitation, the probability of the result is of necessity in its favour,
because the very state of hesitation implies a loss of equilibrium already.=
 It
is only when it encounters cautious foresight=E2=80=94which we may say is j=
ust as
bold, at all events just as strong and powerful as itself=E2=80=94that it i=
s at a
disadvantage; such cases, however, rarely occur. Out of the whole multitude=
 of
prudent men in the world, the great majority are so from timidity.
</p>

<p>
Amongst large masses, boldness is a force, the special cultivation of which=
 can
never be to the detriment of other forces, because the great mass is bound =
to a
higher will by the frame-work and joints of the order of battle and of the
service, and therefore is guided by an intelligent power which is extraneou=
s.
Boldness is therefore here only like a spring held down until its action is
required.
</p>

<p>
The higher the rank the more necessary it is that boldness should be
accompanied by a reflective mind, that it may not be a mere blind outburst =
of
passion to no purpose; for with increase of rank it becomes always less a
matter of self-sacrifice and more a matter of the preservation of others, a=
nd
the good of the whole. Where regulations of the service, as a kind of secon=
d
nature, prescribe for the masses, reflection must be the guide of the Gener=
al,
and in his case individual boldness in action may easily become a fault. St=
ill,
at the same time, it is a fine failing, and must not be looked at in the sa=
me
light as any other. Happy the Army in which an untimely boldness frequently
manifests itself; it is an exuberant growth which shows a rich soil. Even
foolhardiness, that is boldness without an object, is not to be despised; i=
n
point of fact it is the same energy of feeling, only exercised as a kind of
passion without any co-operation of the intelligent faculties. It is only w=
hen
it strikes at the root of obedience, when it treats with contempt the order=
s of
superior authority, that it must be repressed as a dangerous evil, not on i=
ts
own account but on account of the act of disobedience, for there is nothing=
 <i>in
War</i> which is of <i>greater importance than obedience</i>.
</p>

<p>
The reader will readily agree with us that, supposing an equal degree of
discernment to be forthcoming in a certain number of cases, a thousand time=
s as
many of them will end in disaster through over-anxiety as through boldness.
</p>

<p>
One would suppose it natural that the interposition of a reasonable object
should stimulate boldness, and therefore lessen its intrinsic merit, and ye=
t
the reverse is the case in reality.
</p>

<p>
The intervention of lucid thought or the general supremacy of mind deprives=
 the
emotional forces of a great part of their power. On that account <i>boldnes=
s
becomes of rarer occurrence the higher we ascend the scale of rank</i>, for=
 whether
the discernment and the understanding do or do not increase with these rank=
s
still the Commanders, in their several stations as they rise, are pressed u=
pon
more and more severely by objective things, by relations and claims from
without, so that they become the more perplexed the lower the degree of the=
ir
individual intelligence. This so far as regards War is the chief foundation=
 of
the truth of the French proverb:=E2=80=94

In those motives to bold action which arise from the pressure of necessity =
we
must make a distinction. Necessity has its degrees of intensity. If it lies
near at hand, if the person acting is in the pursuit of his object driven i=
nto
great dangers in order to escape others equally great, then we can only adm=
ire
his resolution, which still has also its value. If a young man to show his
skill in horsemanship leaps across a deep cleft, then he is bold; if he mak=
es
the same leap pursued by a troop of head-chopping Janissaries he is only
resolute. But the farther off the necessity from the point of action, the
greater the number of relations intervening which the mind has to traverse;=
 in
order to realise them, by so much the less does necessity take from boldnes=
s in
action. If Frederick the Great, in the year 1756, saw that War was inevitab=
le,
and that he could only escape destruction by being beforehand with his enem=
ies,
it became necessary for him to commence the War himself, but at the same ti=
me
it was certainly very bold: for few men in his position would have made up
their minds to do so.
</p>

<p>
Although Strategy is only the province of Generals-in-Chief or Commanders i=
n
the higher positions, still boldness in all the other branches of an Army i=
s as
little a matter of indifference to it as their other military virtues. With=
 an
Army belonging to a bold race, and in which the spirit of boldness has been
always nourished, very different things may be undertaken than with one in
which this virtue, is unknown; for that reason we have considered it in
connection with an Army. But our subject is specially the boldness of the
General, and yet we have not much to say about it after having described th=
is
military virtue in a general way to the best of our ability.
</p>

<p>
The higher we rise in a position of command, the more of the mind,
understanding, and penetration predominate in activity, the more therefore =
is
boldness, which is a property of the feelings, kept in subjection, and for =
that
reason we find it so rarely in the highest positions, but then, so much the
more should it be admired. Boldness, directed by an overruling intelligence=
, is
the stamp of the hero: this boldness does not consist in venturing directly
against the nature of things, in a downright contempt of the laws of
probability, but, if a choice is once made, in the rigorous adherence to th=
at
higher calculation which genius, the tact of judgment, has gone over with t=
he
speed of lightning. The more boldness lends wings to the mind and the
discernment, so much the farther they will reach in their flight, so much t=
he
more comprehensive will be the view, the more exact the result, but certain=
ly
always only in the sense that with greater objects greater dangers are
connected. The ordinary man, not to speak of the weak and irresolute, arriv=
es
at an exact result so far as such is possible without ocular demonstration,=
 at
most after diligent reflection in his chamber, at a distance from danger an=
d
responsibility. Let danger and responsibility draw close round him in every
direction, then he loses the power of comprehensive vision, and if he retai=
ns
this in any measure by the influence of others, still he will lose his powe=
r of
<i>decision</i>, because in that point no one can help him.
</p>

<p>
We think then that it is impossible to imagine a distinguished General with=
out
boldness, that is to say, that no man can become one who is not born with t=
his
power of the soul, and we therefore look upon it as the first requisite for
such a career. How much of this inborn power, developed and moderated throu=
gh
education and the circumstances of life, is left when the man has attained =
a
high position, is the second question. The greater this power still is, the
stronger will genius be on the wing, the higher will be its flight. The ris=
ks
become always greater, but the purpose grows with them. Whether its lines
proceed out of and get their direction from a distant necessity, or whether
they converge to the keystone of a building which ambition has planned, whe=
ther
Frederick or Alexander acts, is much the same as regards the critical view.=
 If
the one excites the imagination more because it is bolder, the other please=
s
the understanding most, because it has in it more absolute necessity.
</p>

<p>
We have still to advert to one very important circumstance.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of boldness can exist in an Army, either because it is in the
people, or because it has been generated in a successful War conducted by a=
ble
Generals. In the latter case it must of course be dispensed with at the
commencement.
</p>

<p>
Now in our days there is hardly any other means of educating the spirit of =
a
people in this respect, except by War, and that too under bold Generals. By=
 it
alone can that effeminacy of feeling be counteracted, that propensity to se=
ek
for the enjoyment of comfort, which cause degeneracy in a people rising in
prosperity and immersed in an extremely busy commerce.
</p>

<p>
A Nation can hope to have a strong position in the political world only if =
its
character and practice in actual War mutually support each other in constan=
t
reciprocal action.

In War more than anywhere else in the world things happen differently to wh=

immense whole finds himself in a constant whirlpool of false and true

<h3><a name=3D"chap22"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Superiority of Numbers</h3>

<p>
This is in tactics, as well as in Strategy, the most general principle of
victory, and shall be examined by us first in its generality, for which we =
may
be permitted the following exposition:
</p>

<p>
Strategy fixes the point where, the time when, and the numerical force with
which the battle is to be fought. By this triple determination it has there=
fore
a very essential influence on the issue of the combat. If tactics has fough=
t
the battle, if the result is over, let it be victory or defeat, Strategy ma=
kes
such use of it as can be made in accordance with the great object of the Wa=
r.
This object is naturally often a very distant one, seldom does it lie quite
close at hand. A series of other objects subordinate themselves to it as me=
ans.
These objects, which are at the same time means to a higher purpose, may be
practically of various kinds; even the ultimate aim of the whole War may be=
 a
different one in every case. We shall make ourselves acquainted with these
things according as we come to know the separate objects which they come, i=
n
contact with; and it is not our intention here to embrace the whole subject=
 by
a complete enumeration of them, even if that were possible. We therefore le=
t
the employment of the battle stand over for the present.
</p>

<p>
Even those things through which Strategy has an influence on the issue of t=
he
combat, inasmuch as it establishes the same, to a certain extent decrees th=
em,
are not so simple that they can be embraced in one single view. For as Stra=
tegy
appoints time, place and force, it can do so in practice in many ways, each=
 of
which influences in a different manner the result of the combat as well as =
its
consequences. Therefore we shall only get acquainted with this also by degr=
ees,
that is, through the subjects which more closely determine the application.
</p>

<p>
If we strip the combat of all modifications which it may undergo according =
to
its immediate purpose and the circumstances from which it proceeds, lastly =
if
we set aside the valour of the troops, because that is a given quantity, th=
en
there remains only the bare conception of the combat, that is a combat with=
out
form, in which we distinguish nothing but the number of the combatants.
</p>

<p>
This number will therefore determine victory. Now from the number of things
above deducted to get to this point, it is shown that the superiority in
numbers in a battle is only one of the factors employed to produce victory =
that
therefore so far from having with the superiority in number obtained all, o=
r
even only the principal thing, we have perhaps got very little by it, accor=
ding
as the other circumstances which co-operate happen to vary.
</p>

<p>
But this superiority has degrees, it may be imagined as twofold, threefold =
or
fourfold, and every one sees, that by increasing in this way, it must (at l=
ast)
overpower everything else.
</p>

<p>
In such an aspect we grant, that the superiority in numbers is the most
important factor in the result of a combat, only it must be sufficiently gr=
eat
to be a counterpoise to all the other co-operating circumstances. The direc=
t
result of this is, that the greatest possible number of troops should be
brought into action at the decisive point.
</p>

<p>
Whether the troops thus brought are sufficient or not, we have then done in
this respect all that our means allowed. This is the first principle in
Strategy, therefore in general as now stated, it is just as well suited for
Greeks and Persians, or for Englishmen and Mahrattas, as for French and
Germans. But we shall take a glance at our relations in Europe, as respects
War, in order to arrive at some more definite idea on this subject.
</p>

<p>
Here we find Armies much more alike in equipment, organisation, and practic=
al
skill of every kind. There only remains a difference in the military virtue=
 of
Armies, and in the talent of Generals which may fluctuate with time from si=
de
to side. If we go through the military history of modern Europe, we find no
example of a Marathon.
</p>

<p>
Frederick the Great beat 80,000 Austrians at Leuthen with about 30,000 men,=
 and
at Rosbach with 25,000 some 50,000 allies; these are however the only insta=
nces
of victories gained against an enemy double, or more than double in numbers=
.
Charles XII, in the battle of Narva, we cannot well quote, for the Russians
were at that time hardly to be regarded as Europeans, also the principal
circumstances, even of the battle, are too little known. Buonaparte had at
Dresden 120,000 against 220,000, therefore not the double. At Kollin, Frede=
rick
the Great did not succeed, with 30,000 against 50,000 Austrians, neither di=
d
Buonaparte in the desperate battle of Leipsic, where he was 160,000 strong,
against 280,000.
</p>

<p>
From this we may infer, that it is very difficult in the present state of
Europe, for the most talented General to gain a victory over an enemy doubl=
e
his strength. Now if we see double numbers prove such a weight in the scale
against the greatest Generals, we may be sure, that in ordinary cases, in s=
mall
as well as great combats, an important superiority of numbers, but which ne=
ed
not be over two to one, will be sufficient to ensure the victory, however
disadvantageous other circumstances may be. Certainly, we may imagine a def=
ile
which even tenfold would not suffice to force, but in such a case it can be=
 no
question of a battle at all.
</p>

<p>
We think, therefore, that under our conditions, as well as in all similar o=
nes,
the superiority at the decisive point is a matter of capital importance, an=
d
that this subject, in the generality of cases, is decidedly the most import=
ant
of all. The strength at the decisive point depends on the absolute strength=
 of
the Army, and on skill in making use of it.
</p>

<p>
The first rule is therefore to enter the field with an Army as strong as
possible. This sounds very like a commonplace, but still it is really not s=
o.
</p>

<p>
In order to show that for a long time the strength of forces was by no mean=
s
regarded as a chief point, we need only observe, that in most, and even in =
the
most detailed histories of the Wars in the eighteenth century, the strength=
 of
the Armies is either not given at all, or only incidentally, and in no case=
 is
any special value laid upon it. Tempelhof in his history of the Seven
Years=E2=80=99 War is the earliest writer who gives it regularly, but at th=
e same
time he does it only very superficially.
</p>

<p>
Even Massenbach, in his manifold critical observations on the Prussian
campaigns of 1793-94 in the Vosges, talks a great deal about hills and vall=
eys,
roads and footpaths, but does not say a syllable about mutual strength.
</p>

<p>
Another proof lies in a wonderful notion which haunted the heads of many
critical historians, according to which there was a certain size of an Army
which was the best, a normal strength, beyond which the forces in excess we=
re
burdensome rather than serviceable.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Tempelhof and Montalembert are the first we recollect as examples=E2=80=
=94the
first in a passage of his first part, page 148; the other in his correspond=
ence
relative to the plan of operations of the Russians in 1759.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, there are a number of instances to be found, in which all the avail=
able
forces were not really brought into the battle,(*) or into the War, because=
 the
superiority of numbers was not considered to have that importance which in =
the
nature of things belongs to it.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) The Prussians at Jena, 1806. Wellington at Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
If we are thoroughly penetrated with the conviction that with a considerabl=
e
superiority of numbers everything possible is to be effected, then it canno=
t
fail that this clear conviction reacts on the preparations for the War, so =
as
to make us appear in the field with as many troops as possible, and either =
to
give us ourselves the superiority, or at least to guard against the enemy
obtaining it. So much for what concerns the absolute force with which the W=
ar
is to be conducted.
</p>

<p>
The measure of this absolute force is determined by the Government; and
although with this determination the real action of War commences, and it f=
orms
an essential part of the Strategy of the War, still in most cases the Gener=
al
who is to command these forces in the War must regard their absolute streng=
th
as a given quantity, whether it be that he has had no voice in fixing it, o=
r
that circumstances prevented a sufficient expansion being given to it.
</p>

<p>
There remains nothing, therefore, where an absolute superiority is not
attainable, but to produce a relative one at the decisive point, by making
skilful use of what we have.
</p>

<p>
The calculation of space and time appears as the most essential thing to th=
is
end=E2=80=94and this has caused that subject to be regarded as one which em=
braces
nearly the whole art of using military forces. Indeed, some have gone so fa=
r as
to ascribe to great strategists and tacticians a mental organ peculiarly
adapted to this point.
</p>

<p>
But the calculation of time and space, although it lies universally at the
foundation of Strategy, and is to a certain extent its daily bread, is stil=
l
neither the most difficult, nor the most decisive one.
</p>

<p>
If we take an unprejudiced glance at military history, we shall find that t=
he
instances in which mistakes in such a calculation have proved the cause of
serious losses are very rare, at least in Strategy. But if the conception o=
f a
skilful combination of time and space is fully to account for every instanc=
e of
a resolute and active Commander beating several separate opponents with one=
 and
the same army (Frederick the Great, Buonaparte), then we perplex ourselves
unnecessarily with conventional language. For the sake of clearness and the
profitable use of conceptions, it is necessary that things should always be
called by their right names.
</p>

<p>
The right appreciation of their opponents (Daun, Schwartzenberg), the audac=
ity
to leave for a short space of time a small force only before them, energy i=
n
forced marches, boldness in sudden attacks, the intensified activity which
great souls acquire in the moment of danger, these are the grounds of such
victories; and what have these to do with the ability to make an exact
calculation of two such simple things as time and space?
</p>

<p>
But even this ricochetting play of forces, =E2=80=9Cwhen the victories at R=
osbach
and Montmirail give the impulse to victories at Leuthen and Montereau,=E2=
=80=9D
to which great Generals on the defensive have often trusted, is still, if w=
e
would be clear and exact, only a rare occurrence in history.
</p>

<p>
Much more frequently the relative superiority=E2=80=94that is, the skilful
assemblage of superior forces at the decisive point=E2=80=94has its foundat=
ion in
the right appreciation of those points, in the judicious direction which by
that means has been given to the forces from the very first, and in the
resolution required to sacrifice the unimportant to the advantage of the
important=E2=80=94that is, to keep the forces concentrated in an overpoweri=
ng
mass. In this, Frederick the Great and Buonaparte are particularly
characteristic.
</p>

<p>
We think we have now allotted to the superiority in numbers the importance
which belongs to it; it is to be regarded as the fundamental idea, always t=
o be
aimed at before all and as far as possible.
</p>

<p>
But to regard it on this account as a necessary condition of victory would =
be a
complete misconception of our exposition; in the conclusion to be drawn fro=
m it
there lies nothing more than the value which should attach to numerical
strength in the combat. If that strength is made as great as possible, then=
 the
maxim is satisfied; a review of the total relations must then decide whethe=
r or
not the combat is to be avoided for want of sufficient force.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Owing to our freedom from invasion, and to the condition which arise in=
 our
Colonial Wars, we have not yet, in England, arrived at a correct appreciati=
on
of the value of superior numbers in War, and still adhere to the idea of an
Army just =E2=80=9Cbig enough,=E2=80=9D which Clausewitz has so unsparingly
ridiculed. (EDITOR.)

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap23"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>The Surprise</h3>

<p>
From the subject of the foregoing chapter, the general endeavour to attain =
a
relative superiority, there follows another endeavour which must consequent=
ly
be just as general in its nature: this is the <i>surprise</i> of the enemy.=
 It lies
more or less at the foundation of all undertakings, for without it the
preponderance at the decisive point is not properly conceivable.
</p>

<p>
The surprise is, therefore, not only the means to the attainment of numeric=
al
superiority; but it is also to be regarded as a substantive principle in
itself, on account of its moral effect. When it is successful in a high deg=
ree,
confusion and broken courage in the enemy=E2=80=99s ranks are the consequen=
ces;
and of the degree to which these multiply a success, there are examples eno=
ugh,
great and small. We are not now speaking of the particular surprise which
belongs to the attack, but of the endeavour by measures generally, and
especially by the distribution of forces, to surprise the enemy, which can =
be
imagined just as well in the defensive, and which in the tactical defence
particularly is a chief point.
</p>

<p>
We say, surprise lies at the foundation of all undertakings without excepti=
on,
only in very different degrees according to the nature of the undertaking a=
nd
other circumstances.
</p>

<p>
This difference, indeed, originates in the properties or peculiarities of t=
he
Army and its Commander, in those even of the Government.
</p>

<p>
Secrecy and rapidity are the two factors in this product and these suppose =
in
the Government and the Commander-in-Chief great energy, and on the part of =
the
Army a high sense of military duty. With effeminacy and loose principles it=
 is
in vain to calculate upon a surprise. But so general, indeed so indispensab=
le,
as is this endeavour, and true as it is that it is never wholly unproductiv=
e of
effect, still it is not the less true that it seldom succeeds to a <i>remar=
kable</i>
degree, and this follows from the nature of the idea itself. We should form=
 an
erroneous conception if we believed that by this means chiefly there is muc=
h to
be attained in War. In idea it promises a great deal; in the execution it
generally sticks fast by the friction of the whole machine.
</p>

<p>
In tactics the surprise is much more at home, for the very natural reason t=
hat
all times and spaces are on a smaller scale. It will, therefore, in Strateg=
y be
the more feasible in proportion as the measures lie nearer to the province =
of
tactics, and more difficult the higher up they lie towards the province of
policy.
</p>

<p>
The preparations for a War usually occupy several months; the assembly of a=
n
Army at its principal positions requires generally the formation of dep=C3=
=B4ts and
magazines, and long marches, the object of which can be guessed soon enough=
.
</p>

<p>
It therefore rarely happens that one State surprises another by a War, or b=
y
the direction which it gives the mass of its forces. In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, when War turned very much upon sieges, it was a frequ=
ent
aim, and quite a peculiar and important chapter in the Art of War, to inves=
t a
strong place unexpectedly, but even that only rarely succeeded.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Railways, steamships, and telegraphs have, however, enormously modified=
 the
relative importance and practicability of surprise. (EDITOR.)
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, with things which can be done in a day or two, a surpris=
e is
much more conceivable, and, therefore, also it is often not difficult thus =
to
gain a march upon the enemy, and thereby a position, a point of country, a
road, &amp;c. But it is evident that what surprise gains in this way in eas=
y
execution, it loses in the efficacy, as the greater the efficacy the greate=
r
always the difficulty of execution. Whoever thinks that with such surprises=
 on
a small scale, he may connect great results=E2=80=94as, for example, the ga=
in of
a battle, the capture of an important magazine=E2=80=94believes in somethin=
g
which it is certainly very possible to imagine, but for which there is no
warrant in history; for there are upon the whole very few instances where
anything great has resulted from such surprises; from which we may justly
conclude that inherent difficulties lie in the way of their success.
</p>

<p>
Certainly, whoever would consult history on such points must not depend on
sundry battle steeds of historical critics, on their wise dicta and
self-complacent terminology, but look at facts with his own eyes. There is,=
 for
instance, a certain day in the campaign in Silesia, 1761, which, in this
respect, has attained a kind of notoriety. It is the 22nd July, on which
Frederick the Great gained on Laudon the march to Nossen, near Neisse, by
which, as is said, the junction of the Austrian and Russian armies in Upper
Silesia became impossible, and, therefore, a period of four weeks was gaine=
d by
the King. Whoever reads over this occurrence carefully in the principal
histories,(*) and considers it impartially, will, in the march of the 22nd
July, never find this importance; and generally in the whole of the fashion=
able
logic on this subject, he will see nothing but contradictions; but in the
proceedings of Laudon, in this renowned period of man=C5=93uvres, much that=
 is
unaccountable. How could one, with a thirst for truth, and clear conviction=
,
accept such historical evidence?
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Tempelhof, The Veteran, Frederick the Great. Compare also (Clausewitz)
=E2=80=9C<i>Hinterlassene Werke</i>,=E2=80=9D vol. x., p. 158.
</p>

<p>
When we promise ourselves great effects in a campaign from the principle of
surprising, we think upon great activity, rapid resolutions, and forced
marches, as the means of producing them; but that these things, even when
forthcoming in a very high degree, will not always produce the desired effe=
ct,
we see in examples given by Generals, who may be allowed to have had the
greatest talent in the use of these means, Frederick the Great and Buonapar=
te.
The first when he left Dresden so suddenly in July 1760, and falling upon
Lascy, then turned against Dresden, gained nothing by the whole of that
intermezzo, but rather placed his affairs in a condition notably worse, as =
the
fortress Glatz fell in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
In 1813, Buonaparte turned suddenly from Dresden twice against Bl=C3=BCcher=
, to say
nothing of his incursion into Bohemia from Upper Lusatia, and both times
without in the least attaining his object. They were blows in the air which
only cost him time and force, and might have placed him in a dangerous posi=
tion
in Dresden.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, even in this field, a surprise does not necessarily meet with gr=
eat
success through the mere activity, energy, and resolution of the Commander;=
 it
must be favoured by other circumstances. But we by no means deny that there=
 can
be success; we only connect with it a necessity of favourable circumstances=
,
which, certainly do not occur very frequently, and which the Commander can
seldom bring about himself.
</p>

<p>
Just those two Generals afford each a striking illustration of this. We tak=
e
first Buonaparte in his famous enterprise against Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s Ar=
my in
February 1814, when it was separated from the Grand Army, and descending th=
e
Marne. It would not be easy to find a two days=E2=80=99 march to surprise t=
he
enemy productive of greater results than this; Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s Army,=
 extended
over a distance of three days=E2=80=99 march, was beaten in detail, and suf=
fered
a loss nearly equal to that of defeat in a great battle. This was completel=
y
the effect of a surprise, for if Bl=C3=BCcher had thought of such a near
possibility of an attack from Buonaparte(*) he would have organised his mar=
ch
quite differently. To this mistake of Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s the result is =
to be
attributed. Buonaparte did not know all these circumstances, and so there w=
as a
piece of good fortune that mixed itself up in his favour.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Bl=C3=BCcher believed his march to be covered by Pahlen=E2=80=99s Cossa=
cks, but
these had been withdrawn without warning to him by the Grand Army Headquart=
ers
under Schwartzenberg.
</p>

<p>
It is the same with the battle of Liegnitz, 1760. Frederick the Great gaine=
d
this fine victory through altering during the night a position which he had
just before taken up. Laudon was through this completely surprised, and los=
t 70
pieces of artillery and 10,000 men. Although Frederick the Great had at thi=
s
time adopted the principle of moving backwards and forwards in order to mak=
e a
battle impossible, or at least to disconcert the enemy=E2=80=99s plans, sti=
ll the
alteration of position on the night of the 14-15 was not made exactly with =
that
intention, but as the King himself says, because the position of the 14th d=
id
not please him. Here, therefore, also chance was hard at work; without this
happy conjunction of the attack and the change of position in the night, an=
d
the difficult nature of the country, the result would not have been the sam=
e.
</p>

<p>
Also in the higher and highest province of Strategy there are some instance=
s of
surprises fruitful in results. We shall only cite the brilliant marches of =
the
Great Elector against the Swedes from Franconia to Pomerania and from the M=
ark
(Brandenburg) to the Pregel in 1757, and the celebrated passage of the Alps=
 by
Buonaparte, 1800. In the latter case an Army gave up its whole theatre of w=
ar
by a capitulation, and in 1757 another Army was very near giving up its the=
atre
of war and itself as well. Lastly, as an instance of a War wholly unexpecte=
d,
we may bring forward the invasion of Silesia by Frederick the Great. Great =
and
powerful are here the results everywhere, but such events are not common in
history if we do not confuse with them cases in which a State, for want of
activity and energy (Saxony 1756, and Russia, 1812), has not completed its
preparations in time.
</p>

<p>
Now there still remains an observation which concerns the essence of the th=
ing.
A surprise can only be effected by that party which gives the law to the ot=
her;
and he who is in the right gives the law. If we surprise the adversary by a
wrong measure, then instead of reaping good results, we may have to bear a
sound blow in return; in any case the adversary need not trouble himself mu=
ch
about our surprise, he has in our mistake the means of turning off the evil=
. As
the offensive includes in itself much more positive action than the defensi=
ve,
so the surprise is certainly more in its place with the assailant, but by n=
o
means invariably, as we shall hereafter see. Mutual surprises by the offens=
ive
and defensive may therefore meet, and then that one will have the advantage=
 who
has hit the nail on the head the best.
</p>

<p>
So should it be, but practical life does not keep to this line so exactly, =
and
that for a very simple reason. The moral effects which attend a surprise of=
ten
convert the worst case into a good one for the side they favour, and do not
allow the other to make any regular determination. We have here in view mor=
e
than anywhere else not only the chief Commander, but each single one, becau=
se a
surprise has the effect in particular of greatly loosening unity, so that t=
he
individuality of each separate leader easily comes to light.
</p>

<p>
Much depends here on the general relation in which the two parties stand to
each other. If the one side through a general moral superiority can intimid=
ate
and outdo the other, then he can make use of the surprise with more success=
,
and even reap good fruit where properly he should come to ruin.

<h3><a name=3D"chap24"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>Stratagem</h3>

<p>
Stratagem implies a concealed intention, and therefore is opposed to
straightforward dealing, in the same way as wit is the opposite of direct
proof. It has therefore nothing in common with means of persuasion, of
self-interest, of force, but a great deal to do with deceit, because that
likewise conceals its object. It is itself a deceit as well when it is done=
,
but still it differs from what is commonly called deceit, in this respect t=
hat
there is no direct breach of word. The deceiver by stratagem leaves it to t=
he
person himself whom he is deceiving to commit the errors of understanding w=
hich
at last, flowing into <i>one</i> result, suddenly change the nature of thin=
gs in his
eyes. We may therefore say, as nit is a sleight of hand with ideas and
conceptions, so stratagem is a sleight of hand with actions.
</p>

<p>
At first sight it appears as if Strategy had not improperly derived its nam=
e
from stratagem; and that, with all the real and apparent changes which the
whole character of War has undergone since the time of the Greeks, this ter=
m
still points to its real nature.
</p>

<p>
If we leave to tactics the actual delivery of the blow, the battle itself, =
and
look upon Strategy as the art of using this means with skill, then besides =
the
forces of the character, such as burning ambition which always presses like=
 a
spring, a strong will which hardly bends &amp;c. &amp;c., there seems no
subjective quality so suited to guide and inspire strategic activity as
stratagem. The general tendency to surprise, treated of in the foregoing
chapter, points to this conclusion, for there is a degree of stratagem, be =
it
ever so small, which lies at the foundation of every attempt to surprise.
</p>

<p>
But however much we feel a desire to see the actors in War outdo each other=
 in
hidden activity, readiness, and stratagem, still we must admit that these
qualities show themselves but little in history, and have rarely been able =
to
work their way to the surface from amongst the mass of relations and
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The explanation of this is obvious, and it is almost identical with the sub=
ject
matter of the preceding chapter.
</p>

<p>
Strategy knows no other activity than the regulating of combat with the
measures which relate to it. It has no concern, like ordinary life, with
transactions which consist merely of words=E2=80=94that is, in expressions,
declarations, &amp;c. But these, which are very inexpensive, are chiefly th=
e
means with which the wily one takes in those he practises upon.
</p>

<p>
That which there is like it in War, plans and orders given merely as
make-believers, false reports sent on purpose to the enemy=E2=80=94is usual=
ly of
so little effect in the strategic field that it is only resorted to in
particular cases which offer of themselves, therefore cannot be regarded as
spontaneous action which emanates from the leader.
</p>

<p>
But such measures as carrying out the arrangements for a battle, so far as =
to
impose upon the enemy, require a considerable expenditure of time and power=
; of
course, the greater the impression to be made, the greater the expenditure =
in
these respects. And as this is usually not given for the purpose, very few
demonstrations, so-called, in Strategy, effect the object for which they ar=
e
designed. In fact, it is dangerous to detach large forces for any length of
time merely for a trick, because there is always the risk of its being done=
 in
vain, and then these forces are wanted at the decisive point.
</p>

<p>
The chief actor in War is always thoroughly sensible of this sober truth, a=
nd
therefore he has no desire to play at tricks of agility. The bitter earnest=
ness
of necessity presses so fully into direct action that there is no room for =
that
game. In a word, the pieces on the strategical chess-board want that mobili=
ty
which is the element of stratagem and subtility.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion which we draw, is that a correct and penetrating eye is a mo=
re
necessary and more useful quality for a General than craftiness, although t=
hat
also does no harm if it does not exist at the expense of necessary qualitie=
s of
the heart, which is only too often the case.
</p>

<p>
But the weaker the forces become which are under the command of Strategy, s=
o
much the more they become adapted for stratagem, so that to the quite feebl=
e
and little, for whom no prudence, no sagacity is any longer sufficient at t=
he
point where all art seems to forsake him, stratagem offers itself as a last
resource. The more helpless his situation, the more everything presses towa=
rds
one single, desperate blow, the more readily stratagem comes to the aid of =
his
boldness. Let loose from all further calculations, freed from all concern f=
or
the future, boldness and stratagem intensify each other, and thus collect a=
t
one point an infinitesimal glimmering of hope into a single ray, which may
likewise serve to kindle a flame.

<p>
The best Strategy is <i>always to be very strong</i>, first generally then =
at the
decisive point. Therefore, apart from the energy which creates the Army, a =
work
which is not always done by the General, there is no more imperative and no
simpler law for Strategy than to <i>keep the forces concentrated</i>.=E2=80=
=94No portion
is to be separated from the main body unless called away by some urgent
necessity. On this maxim we stand firm, and look upon it as a guide to be
depended upon. What are the reasonable grounds on which a detachment of for=
ces
may be made we shall learn by degrees. Then we shall also see that this
principle cannot have the same general effects in every War, but that these=
 are
different according to the means and end.
</p>

<p>
It seems incredible, and yet it has happened a hundred times, that troops h=

If the concentration of the whole force is acknowledged as the norm, and ev=

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap26"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>Assembly of Forces in Time</h3>

<p>
We have here to deal with a conception which in real life diffuses many kin=
ds
of illusory light. A clear definition and development of the idea is theref=
ore
necessary, and we hope to be allowed a short analysis.
</p>

<p>
War is the shock of two opposing forces in collision with each other, from
which it follows as a matter of course that the stronger not only destroys =
the
other, but carries it forward with it in its movement. This fundamentally
admits of no successive action of powers, but makes the simultaneous
application of all forces intended for the shock appear as a primordial law=
 of
War.
</p>

<p>
So it is in reality, but only so far as the struggle resembles also in prac=
tice
a mechanical shock, but when it consists in a lasting, mutual action of
destructive forces, then we can certainly imagine a successive action of
forces. This is the case in tactics, principally because firearms form the
basis of all tactics, but also for other reasons as well. If in a fire comb=
at
1000 men are opposed to 500, then the gross loss is calculated from the amo=
unt
of the enemy=E2=80=99s force and our own; 1000 men fire twice as many shots=
 as
500, but more shots will take effect on the 1000 than on the 500 because it=
 is
assumed that they stand in closer order than the other. If we were to suppo=
se
the number of hits to be double, then the losses on each side would be equa=
l.
From the 500 there would be for example 200 disabled, and out of the body o=
f
1000 likewise the same; now if the 500 had kept another body of equal numbe=
r
quite out of fire, then both sides would have 800 effective men; but of the=
se,
on the one side there would be 500 men quite fresh, fully supplied with
ammunition, and in their full vigour; on the other side only 800 all alike
shaken in their order, in want of sufficient ammunition and weakened in
physical force. The assumption that the 1000 men merely on account of their
greater number would lose twice as many as 500 would have lost in their pla=
ce,
is certainly not correct; therefore the greater loss which the side suffers
that has placed the half of its force in reserve, must be regarded as a
disadvantage in that original formation; further it must be admitted, that =
in
the generality of cases the 1000 men would have the advantage at the first
commencement of being able to drive their opponent out of his position and
force him to a retrograde movement; now, whether these two advantages are a
counterpoise to the disadvantage of finding ourselves with 800 men to a cer=
tain
extent disorganised by the combat, opposed to an enemy who is not materiall=
y
weaker in numbers and who has 500 quite fresh troops, is one that cannot be
decided by pursuing an analysis further, we must here rely upon experience,=
 and
there will scarcely be an officer experienced in War who will not in the
generality of cases assign the advantage to that side which has the fresh
troops.
</p>

<p>
In this way it becomes evident how the employment of too many forces in com=
bat
may be disadvantageous; for whatever advantages the superiority may give in=
 the
first moment, we may have to pay dearly for in the next.
</p>

<p>
But this danger only endures as long as the disorder, the state of confusio=
n
and weakness lasts, in a word, up to the crisis which every combat brings w=
ith
it even for the conqueror. Within the duration of this relaxed state of
exhaustion, the appearance of a proportionate number of fresh troops is
decisive.
</p>

<p>
But when this disordering effect of victory stops, and therefore only the m=
oral
superiority remains which every victory gives, then it is no longer possibl=
e
for fresh troops to restore the combat, they would only be carried along in=
 the
general movement; a beaten Army cannot be brought back to victory a day aft=
er
by means of a strong reserve. Here we find ourselves at the source of a hig=
hly
material difference between tactics and strategy.
</p>

<p>
The tactical results, the results within the four corners of the battle, an=
d
before its close, lie for the most part within the limits of that period of
disorder and weakness. But the strategic result, that is to say, the result=
 of
the total combat, of the victories realised, let them be small or great, li=
es
completely (beyond) outside of that period. It is only when the results of
partial combats have bound themselves together into an independent whole, t=
hat
the strategic result appears, but then, the state of crisis is over, the fo=
rces
have resumed their original form, and are now only weakened to the extent o=
f
those actually destroyed (placed <i>hors de combat</i>).
</p>

<p>
The consequence of this difference is, that tactics can make a continued us=
e of
forces, Strategy only a simultaneous one.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) See chaps. xiii., and xiv., Book III and chap. xxix. Book V.=E2=80=94TR=
.
</p>

<p>
If I cannot, in tactics, decide all by the first success, if I have to fear=
 the
next moment, it follows of itself that I employ only so much of my force fo=
r
the success of the first moment as appears sufficient for that object, and =
keep
the rest beyond the reach of fire or conflict of any kind, in order to be a=
ble
to oppose fresh troops to fresh, or with such to overcome those that are
exhausted. But it is not so in Strategy. Partly, as we have just shown, it =
has
not so much reason to fear a reaction after a success realised, because wit=
h
that success the crisis stops; partly all the forces strategically employed=
 are
not necessarily weakened. Only so much of them as have been tactically in
conflict with the enemy=E2=80=99s force, that is, engaged in partial combat=
, are
weakened by it; consequently, only so much as was unavoidably necessary, bu=
t by
no means all which was strategically in conflict with the enemy, unless tac=
tics
has expended them unnecessarily. Corps which, on account of the general
superiority in numbers, have either been little or not at all engaged, whos=
e
presence alone has assisted in the result, are after the decision the same =
as
they were before, and for new enterprises as efficient as if they had been
entirely inactive. How greatly such corps which thus constitute our excess =
may
contribute to the total success is evident in itself; indeed, it is not
difficult to see how they may even diminish considerably the loss of the fo=
rces
engaged in tactical, conflict on our side.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, in Strategy the loss does not increase with the number of th=
e
troops employed, but is often diminished by it, and if, as a natural
consequence, the decision in our favor is, by that means, the more certain,
then it follows naturally that in Strategy we can never employ too many for=
ces,
and consequently also that they must be applied simultaneously to the immed=
iate
purpose.
</p>

<p>
But we must vindicate this proposition upon another ground. We have hithert=
o
only spoken of the combat itself; it is the real activity in War, but men,
time, and space, which appear as the elements of this activity, must, at th=
e
same time, be kept in view, and the results of their influence brought into
consideration also.
</p>

<p>
Fatigue, exertion, and privation constitute in War a special principle of
destruction, not essentially belonging to contest, but more or less insepar=
ably
bound up with it, and certainly one which especially belongs to Strategy. T=
hey
no doubt exist in tactics as well, and perhaps there in the highest degree;=
 but
as the duration of the tactical acts is shorter, therefore the small effect=
s of
exertion and privation on them can come but little into consideration. But =
in
Strategy on the other hand, where time and space, are on a larger scale, th=
eir
influence is not only always very considerable, but often quite decisive. I=
t is
not at all uncommon for a victorious Army to lose many more by sickness tha=
n on
the field of battle.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, we look at this sphere of destruction in Strategy in the sam=
e
manner as we have considered that of fire and close combat in tactics, then=
 we
may well imagine that everything which comes within its vortex will, at the=
 end
of the campaign or of any other strategic period, be reduced to a state of
weakness, which makes the arrival of a fresh force decisive. We might there=
fore
conclude that there is a motive in the one case as well as the other to str=
ive
for the first success with as few forces as possible, in order to keep up t=
his
fresh force for the last.
</p>

<p>
In order to estimate exactly this conclusion, which, in many cases in pract=
ice,
will have a great appearance of truth, we must direct our attention to the
separate ideas which it contains. In the first place, we must not confuse t=
he
notion of reinforcement with that of fresh unused troops. There are few
campaigns at the end of which an increase of force is not earnestly desired=
 by
the conqueror as well as the conquered, and indeed should appear decisive; =
but
that is not the point here, for that increase of force could not be necessa=
ry
if the force had been so much larger at the first. But it would be contrary=
 to
all experience to suppose that an Army coming fresh into the field is to be
esteemed higher in point of moral value than an Army already in the field, =
just
as a tactical reserve is more to be esteemed than a body of troops which ha=
s
been already severely handled in the fight. Just as much as an unfortunate
campaign lowers the courage and moral powers of an Army, a successful one
raises these elements in their value. In the generality of cases, therefore=
,
these influences are compensated, and then there remains over and above as
clear gain the habituation to War. We should besides look more here to
successful than to unsuccessful campaigns, because when the greater probabi=
lity
of the latter may be seen beforehand, without doubt forces are wanted, and,
therefore, the reserving a portion for future use is out of the question.
</p>

<p>
This point being settled, then the question is, Do the losses which a force
sustains through fatigues and privations increase in proportion to the size=
 of
the force, as is the case in a combat? And to that we answer =E2=80=9CNo.=
=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
The fatigues of War result in a great measure from the dangers with which e=
very
moment of the act of War is more or less impregnated. To encounter these
dangers at all points, to proceed onwards with security in the execution of
one=E2=80=99s plans, gives employment to a multitude of agencies which make=
 up
the tactical and strategic service of the Army. This service is more diffic=
ult
the weaker an Army is, and easier as its numerical superiority over that of=
 the
enemy increases. Who can doubt this? A campaign against a much weaker enemy
will therefore cost smaller efforts than against one just as strong or
stronger.
</p>

<p>
So much for the fatigues. It is somewhat different with the privations; the=
y
consist chiefly of two things, the want of food, and the want of shelter fo=
r
the troops, either in quarters or in suitable camps. Both these wants will =
no
doubt be greater in proportion as the number of men on one spot is greater.=
 But
does not the superiority in force afford also the best means of spreading o=
ut
and finding more room, and therefore more means of subsistence and shelter?
</p>

<p>
If Buonaparte, in his invasion of Russia in 1812, concentrated his Army in
great masses upon one single road in a manner never heard of before, and th=
us
caused privations equally unparalleled, we must ascribe it to his maxim <i>=
that it
is impossible to be too strong at the decisive point</i>. Whether in this i=
nstance
he did not strain the principle too far is a question which would be out of
place here; but it is certain that, if he had made a point of avoiding the
distress which was by that means brought about, he had only to advance on a
greater breadth of front. Room was not wanted for the purpose in Russia, an=
d in
very few cases can it be wanted. Therefore, from this no ground can be dedu=
ced
to prove that the simultaneous employment of very superior forces must prod=
uce
greater weakening. But now, supposing that in spite of the general relief
afforded by setting apart a portion of the Army, wind and weather and the t=
oils
of War had produced a diminution even on the part which as a spare force ha=
d
been reserved for later use, still we must take a comprehensive general vie=
w of
the whole, and therefore ask, Will this diminution of force suffice to
counterbalance the gain in forces, which we, through our superiority in
numbers, may be able to make in more ways than one?
</p>

<p>
But there still remains a most important point to be noticed. In a partial
combat, the force required to obtain a great result can be approximately
estimated without much difficulty, and, consequently, we can form an idea o=
f
what is superfluous. In Strategy this may be said to be impossible, because=
 the
strategic result has no such well-defined object and no such circumscribed
limits as the tactical. Thus what can be looked upon in tactics as an exces=
s of
power, must be regarded in Strategy as a means to give expansion to success=
, if
opportunity offers for it; with the magnitude of the success the gain in fo=
rce
increases at the same time, and in this way the superiority of numbers may =
soon
reach a point which the most careful economy of forces could never have
attained.
</p>

<p>
By means of his enormous numerical superiority, Buonaparte was enabled to r=
each
Moscow in 1812, and to take that central capital. Had he by means of this
superiority succeeded in completely defeating the Russian Army, he would, i=
n
all probability, have concluded a peace in Moscow which in any other way wa=
s
much less attainable. This example is used to explain the idea, not to prov=
e
it, which would require a circumstantial demonstration, for which this is n=
ot
the place.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Compare Book VII., second edition, p. 56.
</p>

<p>
All these reflections bear merely upon the idea of a successive employment =
of
forces, and not upon the conception of a reserve properly so called, which
they, no doubt, come in contact with throughout, but which, as we shall see=
 in
the following chapter, is connected with some other considerations.
</p>

<p>
What we desire to establish here is, that if in tactics the military force
through the mere duration of actual employment suffers a diminution of powe=
r,
if time, therefore, appears as a factor in the result, this is not the case=
 in
Strategy in a material degree. The destructive effects which are also produ=
ced
upon the forces in Strategy by time, are partly diminished through their ma=
ss,
partly made good in other ways, and, therefore, in Strategy it cannot be an
object to make time an ally on its own account by bringing troops successiv=
ely
into action.
</p>

<p>
We say on =E2=80=9Cits own account,=E2=80=9D for the influence which time, =
on
account of other circumstances which it brings about but which are differen=
t
from itself can have, indeed must necessarily have, for one of the two part=
ies,
is quite another thing, is anything but indifferent or unimportant, and wil=
l be
the subject of consideration hereafter.
</p>

<p>
The rule which we have been seeking to set forth is, therefore, that all fo=
rces
which are available and destined for a strategic object should be
<i>simultaneously</i> applied to it; and this application will be so much t=
he more
complete the more everything is compressed into one act and into one moveme=
nt.
</p>

<p>
But still there is in Strategy a renewal of effort and a persistent action
which, as a chief means towards the ultimate success, is more particularly =
not
to be overlooked, it is the <i>continual development of new forces</i>. Thi=
s is also
the subject of another chapter, and we only refer to it here in order to
prevent the reader from having something in view of which we have not been
speaking.
</p>

<p>
We now turn to a subject very closely connected with our present
considerations, which must be settled before full light can be thrown on th=
e
whole, we mean the <i>strategic reserve</i>.

<h3><a name=3D"chap27"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>Strategic Reserve</h3>

<p>
A reserve has two objects which are very distinct from each other, namely,
first, the prolongation and renewal of the combat, and secondly, for use in
case of unforeseen events. The first object implies the utility of a succes=
sive
application of forces, and on that account cannot occur in Strategy. Cases =
in
which a corps is sent to succour a point which is supposed to be about to f=
all
are plainly to be placed in the category of the second object, as the
resistance which has to be offered here could not have been sufficiently
foreseen. But a corps which is destined expressly to prolong the combat, an=
d
with that object in view is placed in rear, would be only a corps placed ou=
t of
reach of fire, but under the command and at the disposition of the General
Commanding in the action, and accordingly would be a tactical and not a
strategic reserve.
</p>

<p>
But the necessity for a force ready for unforeseen events may also take pla=
ce
in Strategy, and consequently there may also be a strategic reserve, but on=
ly
where unforeseen events are imaginable. In tactics, where the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
measures are generally first ascertained by direct sight, and where they ma=
y be
concealed by every wood, every fold of undulating ground, we must naturally
always be alive, more or less, to the possibility of unforeseen events, in
order to strengthen, subsequently, those points which appear too weak, and,=
 in
fact, to modify generally the disposition of our troops, so as to make it
correspond better to that of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Such cases must also happen in Strategy, because the strategic act is direc=
tly
linked to the tactical. In Strategy also many a measure is first adopted in
consequence of what is actually seen, or in consequence of uncertain report=
s
arriving from day to day, or even from hour to hour, and lastly, from the
actual results of the combats it is, therefore, an essential condition of
strategic command that, according to the degree of uncertainty, forces must=
 be
kept in reserve against future contingencies.
</p>

<p>
In the defensive generally, but particularly in the defence of certain
obstacles of ground, like rivers, hills, &amp;c., such contingencies, as is
well known, happen constantly.
</p>

<p>
But this uncertainty diminishes in proportion as the strategic activity has
less of the tactical character, and ceases almost altogether in those regio=
ns
where it borders on politics.
</p>

<p>
The direction in which the enemy leads his columns to the combat can be
perceived by actual sight only; where he intends to pass a river is learnt =
from
a few preparations which are made shortly before; the line by which he prop=
oses
to invade our country is usually announced by all the newspapers before a
pistol shot has been fired. The greater the nature of the measure the less =
it
will take the enemy by surprise. Time and space are so considerable, the
circumstances out of which the action proceeds so public and little suscept=
ible
of alteration, that the coming event is either made known in good time, or =
can
be discovered with reasonable certainty.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the use of a reserve in this province of Strategy, even i=
f
one were available, will always be less efficacious the more the measure ha=
s a
tendency towards being one of a general nature.
</p>

<p>
We have seen that the decision of a partial combat is nothing in itself, bu=
t
that all partial combats only find their complete solution in the decision =
of
the total combat.
</p>

<p>
But even this decision of the total combat has only a relative meaning of m=
any
different gradations, according as the force over which the victory has bee=
n
gained forms a more or less great and important part of the whole. The lost
battle of a corps may be repaired by the victory of the Army. Even the lost
battle of an Army may not only be counterbalanced by the gain of a more
important one, but converted into a fortunate event (the two days of Kulm,
August 29 and 30, 1813(*)). No one can doubt this; but it is just as clear =
that
the weight of each victory (the successful issue of each total combat) is s=
o
much the more substantial the more important the part conquered, and that
therefore the possibility of repairing the loss by subsequent events dimini=
shes
in the same proportion. In another place we shall have to examine this more=
 in
detail; it suffices for the present to have drawn attention to the indubita=
ble
existence of this progression.

sent
unsupported to intercept the retreat of the Austrians and Prussians from
Dresden=E2=80=94but was forgotten by Napoleon.=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<p>
If we now add lastly to these two considerations the third, which is, that =
if
the persistent use of forces in tactics always shifts the great result to t=
he
end of the whole act, law of the simultaneous use of the forces in Strategy=
, on
the contrary, lets the principal result (which need not be the final one) t=
ake
place almost always at the commencement of the great (or whole) act, then i=
n
these three results we have grounds sufficient to find strategic reserves
always more superfluous, always more useless, always more dangerous, the mo=
re
general their destination.
</p>

<p>
The point where the idea of a strategic reserve begins to become inconsiste=
nt
is not difficult to determine: it lies in the SUPREME DECISION. Employment =
must
be given to all the forces within the space of the supreme decision, and ev=
ery
reserve (active force available) which is only intended for use after that
decision is opposed to common sense.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, tactics has in its reserves the means of not only meeting
unforeseen dispositions on the part of the enemy, but also of repairing tha=
t
which never can be foreseen, the result of the combat, should that be
unfortunate; Strategy on the other hand must, at least as far as relates to=
 the
capital result, renounce the use of these means. As A rule, it can only rep=
air
the losses sustained at one point by advantages gained at another, in a few
cases by moving troops from one point to another; the idea of preparing for
such reverses by placing forces in reserve beforehand, can never be enterta=
ined
in Strategy.
</p>

<p>
We have pointed out as an absurdity the idea of a strategic reserve which i=
s
not to co-operate in the capital result, and as it is so beyond a doubt, we
should not have been led into such an analysis as we have made in these two
chapters, were it not that, in the disguise of other ideas, it looks like
something better, and frequently makes its appearance. One person sees in i=
t
the acme of strategic sagacity and foresight; another rejects it, and with =
it
the idea of any reserve, consequently even of a tactical one. This confusio=
n of
ideas is transferred to real life, and if we would see a memorable instance=
 of
it we have only to call to mind that Prussia in 1806 left a reserve of 20,0=
00
men cantoned in the Mark, under Prince Eugene of Wurtemberg, which could no=
t
possibly reach the Saale in time to be of any use, and that another force O=
f
25,000 men belonging to this power remained in East and South Prussia, dest=
ined
only to be put on a war-footing afterwards as a reserve.
</p>

<p>
After these examples we cannot be accused of having been fighting with
windmills.

<h3><a name=3D"chap28"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>Economy of Forces</h3>

<p>
The road of reason, as we have said, seldom allows itself to be reduced to =
a
mathematical line by principles and opinions. There remains always a certai=
n
margin. But it is the same in all the practical arts of life. For the lines=
 of
beauty there are no abscissae and ordinates; circles and ellipses are not
described by means of their algebraical formulae. The actor in War therefor=
e
soon finds he must trust himself to the delicate tact of judgment which,
founded on natural quickness of perception, and educated by reflection, alm=
ost
unconsciously seizes upon the right; he soon finds that at one time he must
simplify the law (by reducing it) to some prominent characteristic points w=
hich
form his rules; that at another the adopted method must become the staff on
which he leans.
</p>

<p>
As one of these simplified characteristic points as a mental appliance, we =
look
upon the principle of watching continually over the co-operation of all for=
ces,
or in other words, of keeping constantly in view that no part of them shoul=
d
ever be idle. Whoever has forces where the enemy does not give them suffici=
ent
employment, whoever has part of his forces on the march=E2=80=94that is, al=
lows
them to lie dead=E2=80=94while the enemy=E2=80=99s are fighting, he is a ba=
d
manager of his forces. In this sense there is a waste of forces, which is e=
ven
worse than their employment to no purpose. If there must be action, then th=
e
first point is that all parts act, because the most purposeless activity st=
ill
keeps employed and destroys a portion of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, whilst =
troops
completely inactive are for the moment quite neutralised. Unmistakably this
idea is bound up with the principles contained in the last three chapters, =
it
is the same truth, but seen from a somewhat more comprehensive point of vie=
w
and condensed into a single conception.

<h3><a name=3D"chap29"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>Geometrical Element</h3>

<p>
The length to which the geometrical element or form in the disposition of
military force in War can become a predominant principle, we see in the art=
 of
fortification, where geometry looks after the great and the little. Also in
tactics it plays a great part. It is the basis of elementary tactics, or of=
 the
theory of moving troops; but in field fortification, as well as in the theo=
ry
of positions, and of their attack, its angles and lines rule like law giver=
s
who have to decide the contest. Many things here were at one time misapplie=
d,
and others were mere fribbles; still, however, in the tactics of the presen=
t
day, in which in every combat the aim is to surround the enemy, the geometr=
ical
element has attained anew a great importance in a very simple, but constant=
ly
recurring application. Nevertheless, in tactics, where all is more movable,
where the moral forces, individual traits, and chance are more influential =
than
in a war of sieges, the geometrical element can never attain to the same de=
gree
of supremacy as in the latter. But less still is its influence in Strategy;
certainly here, also, form in the disposition of troops, the shape of count=
ries
and states is of great importance; but the geometrical element is not decis=
ive,
as in fortification, and not nearly so important as in tactics.=E2=80=94The
manner in which this influence exhibits itself, can only be shown by degree=
s at
those places where it makes its appearance, and deserves notice. Here we wi=
sh
more to direct attention to the difference which there is between tactics a=
nd
Strategy in relation to it.
</p>

<p>
In tactics time and space quickly dwindle to their absolute minimum. If a b=
ody
of troops is attacked in flank and rear by the enemy, it soon gets to a poi=
nt
where retreat no longer remains; such a position is very close to an absolu=
te
impossibility of continuing the fight; it must therefore extricate itself f=
rom
it, or avoid getting into it. This gives to all combinations aiming at this
from the first commencement a great efficiency, which chiefly consists in t=
he
disquietude which it causes the enemy as to consequences. This is why the
geometrical disposition of the forces is such an important factor in the
tactical product.
</p>

<p>
In Strategy this is only faintly reflected, on account of the greater space=
 and
time. We do not fire from one theatre of war upon another; and often weeks =
and
months must pass before a strategic movement designed to surround the enemy=
 can
be executed. Further, the distances are so great that the probability of
hitting the right point at last, even with the best arrangements, is but sm=
all.
</p>

<p>
In Strategy therefore the scope for such combinations, that is for those
resting on the geometrical element, is much smaller, and for the same reaso=
n
the effect of an advantage once actually gained at any point is much greate=
r.
Such advantage has time to bring all its effects to maturity before it is
disturbed, or quite neutralised therein, by any counteracting apprehensions=
. We
therefore do not hesitate to regard as an established truth, that in Strate=
gy
more depends on the number and the magnitude of the victorious combats, tha=
n on
the form of the great lines by which they are connected.
</p>

<p>
A view just the reverse has been a favourite theme of modern theory, becaus=
e a
greater importance was supposed to be thus given to Strategy, and, as the
higher functions of the mind were seen in Strategy, it was thought by that
means to ennoble War, and, as it was said=E2=80=94through a new substitutio=
n of
ideas=E2=80=94to make it more scientific. We hold it to be one of the princ=
ipal
uses of a complete theory openly to expose such vagaries, and as the
geometrical element is the fundamental idea from which theory usually proce=
eds,
therefore we have expressly brought out this point in strong relief.

<h3><a name=3D"chap30"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br>On the Suspension of the Act in =
War</h3>

<p>
If one considers War as an act of mutual destruction, we must of necessity
imagine both parties as making some progress; but at the same time, as rega=
rds
the existing moment, we must almost as necessarily suppose the one party in=
 a
state of expectation, and only the other actually advancing, for circumstan=
ces
can never be actually the same on both sides, or continue so. In time a cha=
nge
must ensue, from which it follows that the present moment is more favourabl=
e to
one side than the other. Now if we suppose that both commanders have a full
knowledge of this circumstance, then the one has a motive for action, which=
 at
the same time is a motive for the other to wait; therefore, according to th=
is
it cannot be for the interest of both at the same time to advance, nor can
waiting be for the interest of both at the same time. This opposition of
interest as regards the object is not deduced here from the principle of
general polarity, and therefore is not in opposition to the argument in the
fifth chapter of the second book; it depends on the fact that here in reali=
ty
the same thing is at once an incentive or motive to both commanders, namely=
 the
probability of improving or impairing their position by future action.
</p>

<p>
But even if we suppose the possibility of a perfect equality of circumstanc=
es
in this respect, or if we take into account that through imperfect knowledg=
e of
their mutual position such an equality may appear to the two Commanders to
subsist, still the difference of political objects does away with this
possibility of suspension. One of the parties must of necessity be assumed
politically to be the aggressor, because no War could take place from defen=
sive
intentions on both sides. But the aggressor has the positive object, the
defender merely a negative one. To the first then belongs the positive acti=
on,
for it is only by that means that he can attain the positive object; theref=
ore,
in cases where both parties are in precisely similar circumstances, the
aggressor is called upon to act by virtue of his positive object.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, from this point of view, a suspension in the act of Warfare,
strictly speaking, is in contradiction with the nature of the thing; becaus=
e
two Armies, being two incompatible elements, should destroy one another
unremittingly, just as fire and water can never put themselves in equilibri=
um,
but act and react upon one another, until one quite disappears. What would =
be
said of two wrestlers who remained clasped round each other for hours witho=
ut
making a movement. Action in War, therefore, like that of a clock which is
wound up, should go on running down in regular motion.=E2=80=94But wild as =
is the
nature of War it still wears the chains of human weakness, and the
contradiction we see here, viz., that man seeks and creates dangers which h=
e
fears at the same time will astonish no one.
</p>

<p>
If we cast a glance at military history in general, we find so much the
opposite of an incessant advance towards the aim, that <i>standing still</i=
> and <i>doing
nothing</i> is quite plainly the <i>normal condition</i> of an Army in the =
midst of War,
<i>acting</i>, the <i>exception</i>. This must almost raise a doubt as to t=
he correctness of
our conception. But if military history leads to this conclusion when viewe=
d in
the mass the latest series of campaigns redeems our position. The War of th=
e
French Revolution shows too plainly its reality, and only proves too clearl=
y
its necessity. In these operations, and especially in the campaigns of
Buonaparte, the conduct of War attained to that unlimited degree of energy
which we have represented as the natural law of the element. This degree is
therefore possible, and if it is possible then it is necessary.
</p>

<p>
How could any one in fact justify in the eyes of reason the expenditure of
forces in War, if acting was not the object? The baker only heats his oven =
if
he has bread to put into it; the horse is only yoked to the carriage if we =
mean
to drive; why then make the enormous effort of a War if we look for nothing
else by it but like efforts on the part of the enemy?
</p>

<p>
So much in justification of the general principle; now as to its modificati=
ons,
as far as they lie in the nature of the thing and are independent of specia=
l
cases.
</p>

<p>
There are three causes to be noticed here, which appear as innate counterpo=
ises
and prevent the over-rapid or uncontrollable movement of the wheel-work.
</p>

<p>
The first, which produces a constant tendency to delay, and is thereby a
retarding principle, is the natural timidity and want of resolution in the
human mind, a kind of inertia in the moral world, but which is produced not=
 by
attractive, but by repellent forces, that is to say, by dread of danger and
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
In the burning element of War, ordinary natures appear to become heavier; t=
he
impulsion given must therefore be stronger and more frequently repeated if =
the
motion is to be a continuous one. The mere idea of the object for which arm=
s
have been taken up is seldom sufficient to overcome this resistant force, a=
nd
if a warlike enterprising spirit is not at the head, who feels himself in W=
ar
in his natural element, as much as a fish in the ocean, or if there is not =
the
pressure from above of some great responsibility, then standing still will =
be
the order of the day, and progress will be the exception.
</p>

<p>
The second cause is the imperfection of human perception and judgment, whic=
h is
greater in War than anywhere, because a person hardly knows exactly his own
position from one moment to another, and can only conjecture on slight grou=
nds
that of the enemy, which is purposely concealed; this often gives rise to t=
he
case of both parties looking upon one and the same object as advantageous f=
or
them, while in reality the interest of one must preponderate; thus then eac=
h
may think he acts wisely by waiting another moment, as we have already said=
 in
the fifth chapter of the second book.
</p>

<p>
The third cause which catches hold, like a ratchet wheel in machinery, from
time to time producing a complete standstill, is the greater strength of th=
e
defensive form. A may feel too weak to attack B, from which it does not fol=
low
that B is strong enough for an attack on A. The addition of strength, which=
 the
defensive gives is not merely lost by assuming the offensive, but also pass=
es
to the enemy just as, figuratively expressed, the difference of <i>a</i> +
<i>b</i> and <i>a</i> =E2=80=93 <i>b</i> is equal to 2<i>b</i>. Therefore i=
t may so
happen that both parties, at one and the same time, not only feel themselve=
s
too weak to attack, but also are so in reality.
</p>

<p>
Thus even in the midst of the act of War itself, anxious sagacity and the
apprehension of too great danger find vantage ground, by means of which the=
y
can exert their power, and tame the elementary impetuosity of War.
</p>

<p>
However, at the same time these causes without an exaggeration of their eff=
ect,
would hardly explain the long states of inactivity which took place in mili=
tary
operations, in former times, in Wars undertaken about interests of no great
importance, and in which inactivity consumed nine-tenths of the time that t=
he
troops remained under arms. This feature in these Wars, is to be traced
principally to the influence which the demands of the one party, and the
condition, and feeling of the other, exercised over the conduct of the
operations, as has been already observed in the chapter on the essence and
object of War.
</p>

<p>
These things may obtain such a preponderating influence as to make of War a
half-and-half affair. A War is often nothing more than an armed neutrality,=
 or
a menacing attitude to support negotiations or an attempt to gain some smal=
l
advantage by small exertions, and then to wait the tide of circumstances, o=
r a
disagreeable treaty obligation, which is fulfilled in the most niggardly wa=
y
possible.
</p>

<p>
In all these cases in which the impulse given by interest is slight, and th=
e
principle of hostility feeble, in which there is no desire to do much, and =
also
not much to dread from the enemy; in short, where no powerful motives press=
 and
drive, cabinets will not risk much in the game; hence this tame mode of
carrying on War, in which the hostile spirit of real War is laid in irons.
</p>

<p>
The more War becomes in this manner devitalised so much the more its theory
becomes destitute of the necessary firm pivots and buttresses for its
reasoning; the necessary is constantly diminishing, the accidental constant=
ly
increasing.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless in this kind of Warfare, there is also a certain shrewdness,
indeed, its action is perhaps more diversified, and more extensive than in =
the
other. Hazard played with realeaux of gold seems changed into a game of
commerce with groschen. And on this field, where the conduct of War spins o=
ut
the time with a number of small flourishes, with skirmishes at outposts, ha=
lf
in earnest half in jest, with long dispositions which end in nothing with
positions and marches, which afterwards are designated as skilful only beca=
use
their infinitesimally small causes are lost, and common sense can make noth=
ing
of them, here on this very field many theorists find the real Art of War at
home: in these feints, parades, half and quarter thrusts of former Wars, th=
ey
find the aim of all theory, the supremacy of mind over matter, and modern W=
ars
appear to them mere savage fisticuffs, from which nothing is to be learnt, =
and
which must be regarded as mere retrograde steps towards barbarism. This opi=
nion
is as frivolous as the objects to which it relates. Where great forces and
great passions are wanting, it is certainly easier for a practised dexterit=
y to
show its game; but is then the command of great forces, not in itself a hig=
her
exercise of the intelligent faculties? Is then that kind of conventional
sword-exercise not comprised in and belonging to the other mode of conducti=
ng
War? Does it not bear the same relation to it as the motions upon a ship to=
 the
motion of the ship itself? Truly it can take place only under the tacit
condition that the adversary does no better. And can we tell, how long he m=
ay
choose to respect those conditions? Has not then the French Revolution fall=
en
upon us in the midst of the fancied security of our old system of War, and
driven us from Chalons to Moscow? And did not Frederick the Great in like
manner surprise the Austrians reposing in their ancient habits of War, and =
make
their monarchy tremble? Woe to the cabinet which, with a shilly-shally poli=
cy,
and a routine-ridden military system, meets with an adversary who, like the
rude element, knows no other law than that of his intrinsic force. Every
deficiency in energy and exertion is then a weight in the scales in favour =
of
the enemy; it is not so easy then to change from the fencing posture into t=
hat
of an athlete, and a slight blow is often sufficient to knock down the whol=
e.
</p>

<p>
The result of all the causes now adduced is, that the hostile action of a
campaign does not progress by a continuous, but by an intermittent movement=
,
and that, therefore, between the separate bloody acts, there is a period of
watching, during which both parties fall into the defensive, and also that
usually a higher object causes the principle of aggression to predominate o=
n
one side, and thus leaves it in general in an advancing position, by which =
then
its proceedings become modified in some degree.

<h3><a name=3D"chap31"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>On the Character of Modern War<=
/h3>

<p>
The attention which must be paid to the character of War as it is now made,=
 has
a great influence upon all plans, especially on strategic ones.
</p>

<p>
Since all methods formerly usual were upset by Buonaparte=E2=80=99s luck an=
d
boldness, and first-rate Powers almost wiped out at a blow; since the Spani=
ards
by their stubborn resistance have shown what the general arming of a nation=
 and
insurgent measures on a great scale can effect, in spite of weakness and
porousness of individual parts; since Russia, by the campaign of 1812 has
taught us, first, that an Empire of great dimensions is not to be conquered
(which might have been easily known before), secondly, that the probability=
 of
final success does not in all cases diminish in the same measure as battles=
,
capitals, and provinces are lost (which was formerly an incontrovertible
principle with all diplomatists, and therefore made them always ready to en=
ter
at once into some bad temporary peace), but that a nation is often stronges=
t in
the heart of its country, if the enemy=E2=80=99s offensive power has exhaus=
ted
itself, and with what enormous force the defensive then springs over to the
offensive; further, since Prussia (1813) has shown that sudden efforts may =
add
to an Army sixfold by means of the militia, and that this militia is just a=
s
fit for service abroad as in its own country;=E2=80=94since all these event=
s have
shown what an enormous factor the heart and sentiments of a Nation may be i=
n
the product of its political and military strength, in fine, since governme=
nts
have found out all these additional aids, it is not to be expected that the=
y
will let them lie idle in future Wars, whether it be that danger threatens
their own existence, or that restless ambition drives them on.
</p>

<p>
That a War which is waged with the whole weight of the national power on ea=
ch
side must be organised differently in principle to those where everything i=
s
calculated according to the relations of standing Armies to each other, it =
is
easy to perceive. Standing Armies once resembled fleets, the land force the=
 sea
force in their relations to the remainder of the State, and from that the A=
rt
of War on shore had in it something of naval tactics, which it has now quit=
e
lost.

<h3><a name=3D"chap32"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>Tension and Rest</h3>

<h4><i>The Dynamic Law of War</i></h4>

<p>
We have seen in the sixteenth chapter of this book, how, in most campaigns,
much more time used to be spent in standing still and inaction than in
activity.
</p>

<p>
Now, although, as observed in the preceding chapter we see quite a differen=
t
character in the present form of War, still it is certain that real action =
will
always be interrupted more or less by long pauses; and this leads to the
necessity of our examining more closely the nature of these two phases of W=
ar.
</p>

<p>
If there is a suspension of action in War, that is, if neither party wills
something positive, there is rest, and consequently equilibrium, but certai=
nly
an equilibrium in the largest signification, in which not only the moral an=
d
physical war-forces, but all relations and interests, come into calculation=
. As
soon as ever one of the two parties proposes to himself a new positive obje=
ct,
and commences active steps towards it, even if it is only by preparations, =
and
as soon as the adversary opposes this, there is a tension of powers; this l=
asts
until the decision takes place=E2=80=94that is, until one party either give=
s up
his object or the other has conceded it to him.
</p>

<p>
This decision=E2=80=94the foundation of which lies always in the
combat=E2=80=94combinations which are made on each side=E2=80=94is followed=
 by a
movement in one or other direction.
</p>

<p>
When this movement has exhausted itself, either in the difficulties which h=
ad
to be mastered, in overcoming its own internal friction, or through new
resistant forces prepared by the acts of the enemy, then either a state of =
rest
takes place or a new tension with a decision, and then a new movement, in m=
ost
cases in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
This speculative distinction between equilibrium, tension, and motion is mo=
re
essential for practical action than may at first sight appear.
</p>

<p>
In a state of rest and of equilibrium a varied kind of activity may prevail=
 on
one side that results from opportunity, and does not aim at a great alterat=
ion.
Such an activity may contain important combats=E2=80=94even pitched
battles=E2=80=94but yet it is still of quite a different nature, and on tha=
t
account generally different in its effects.
</p>

<p>
If a state of tension exists, the effects of the decision are always greate=
r
partly because a greater force of will and a greater pressure of circumstan=
ces
manifest themselves therein; partly because everything has been prepared an=
d
arranged for a great movement. The decision in such cases resembles the eff=
ect
of a mine well closed and tamped, whilst an event in itself perhaps just as
great, in a state of rest, is more or less like a mass of powder puffed awa=
y in
the open air.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, as a matter of course, the state of tension must be imagi=
ned
in different degrees of intensity, and it may therefore approach gradually =
by
many steps towards the state of rest, so that at the last there is a very
slight difference between them.
</p>

<p>
Now the real use which we derive from these reflections is the conclusion t=
hat
every measure which is taken during a state of tension is more important an=
d
more prolific in results than the same measure could be in a state of
equilibrium, and that this importance increases immensely in the highest
degrees of tension.
</p>

<p>
The cannonade of Valmy, September 20, 1792, decided more than the battle of
Hochkirch, October 14, 1758.
</p>

<p>
In a tract of country which the enemy abandons to us because he cannot defe=
nd
it, we can settle ourselves differently from what we should do if the retre=
at
of the enemy was only made with the view to a decision under more favourabl=
e
circumstances. Again, a strategic attack in course of execution, a faulty
position, a single false march, may be decisive in its consequence; whilst =
in a
state of equilibrium such errors must be of a very glaring kind, even to ex=
cite
the activity of the enemy in a general way.
</p>

<p>
Most bygone Wars, as we have already said, consisted, so far as regards the
greater part of the time, in this state of equilibrium, or at least in such
short tensions with long intervals between them, and weak in their effects,
that the events to which they gave rise were seldom great successes, often =
they
were theatrical exhibitions, got up in honour of a royal birthday (Hochkirc=
h),
often a mere satisfying of the honour of the arms (Kunersdorf), or the pers=
onal
vanity of the commander (Freiberg).
</p>

<p>
That a Commander should thoroughly understand these states, that he should =
have
the tact to act in the spirit of them, we hold to be a great requisite, and=
 we
have had experience in the campaign of 1806 how far it is sometimes wanting=
. In
that tremendous tension, when everything pressed on towards a supreme decis=
ion,
and that alone with all its consequences should have occupied the whole sou=
l of
the Commander, measures were proposed and even partly carried out (such as =
the
reconnaissance towards Franconia), which at the most might have given a kin=
d of
gentle play of oscillation within a state of equilibrium. Over these blunde=
ring
schemes and views, absorbing the activity of the Army, the really necessary
means, which could alone save, were lost sight of.
</p>

<p>
But this speculative distinction which we have made is also necessary for o=
ur
further progress in the construction of our theory, because all that we hav=
e to
say on the relation of attack and defence, and on the completion of this
double-sided act, concerns the state of the crisis in which the forces are
placed during the tension and motion, and because all the activity which ca=
n
take place during the condition of equilibrium can only be regarded and tre=
ated
as a corollary; for that crisis is the real War and this state of equilibri=
um
only its reflection.

<h3><a name=3D"chap33"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>Introductory</h3>

<p>
Having in the foregoing book examined the subjects which may be regarded as=
 the
efficient elements of War, we shall now turn our attention to the combat as=
 the
real activity in Warfare, which, by its physical and moral effects, embrace=
s
sometimes more simply, sometimes in a more complex manner, the object of th=
e
whole campaign. In this activity and in its effects these elements must
therefore, reappear.
</p>

<p>
The formation of the combat is tactical in its nature; we only glance at it
here in a general way in order to get acquainted with it in its aspect as a
whole. In practice the minor or more immediate objects give every combat a
characteristic form; these minor objects we shall not discuss until hereaft=
er.
But these peculiarities are in comparison to the general characteristics of=
 a
combat mostly only insignificant, so that most combats are very like one
another, and, therefore, in order to avoid repeating that which is general =
at
every stage, we are compelled to look into it here, before taking up the
subject of its more special application.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, therefore, we shall give in the next chapter, in a few
words, the characteristics of the modern battle in its tactical course, bec=
ause
that lies at the foundation of our conceptions of what the battle really is=
.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap34"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>Character of a Modern Battle</h3>

<p>
According to the notion we have formed of tactics and strategy, it follows,=
 as
a matter of course, that if the nature of the former is changed, that chang=
e
must have an influence on the latter. If tactical facts in one case are
entirely different from those in another, then the strategic, must be so al=
so,
if they are to continue consistent and reasonable. It is therefore importan=
t to
characterise a general action in its modern form before we advance with the
study of its employment in strategy.
</p>

<p>
What do we do now usually in a great battle? We place ourselves quietly in
great masses arranged contiguous to and behind one another. We deploy
relatively only a small portion of the whole, and let it wring itself out i=
n a
fire-combat which lasts for several hours, only interrupted now and again, =
and
removed hither and thither by separate small shocks from charges with the
bayonet and cavalry attacks. When this line has gradually exhausted part of=
 its
warlike ardour in this manner and there remains nothing more than the cinde=
rs,
it is withdrawn(*) and replaced by another.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) The relief of the fighting line played a great part in the battles of t=
he
Smooth-Bore era; it was necessitated by the fouling of the muskets, physica=
l
fatigue of the men and consumption of ammunition, and was recognised as bot=
h
necessary and advisable by Napoleon himself.=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<p>
In this manner the battle on a modified principle burns slowly away like we=
t
powder, and if the veil of night commands it to stop, because neither party=
 can
any longer see, and neither chooses to run the risk of blind chance, then a=
n
account is taken by each side respectively of the masses remaining, which c=
an
be called still effective, that is, which have not yet quite collapsed like
extinct volcanoes; account is taken of the ground gained or lost, and of ho=
w
stands the security of the rear; these results with the special impressions=
 as
to bravery and cowardice, ability and stupidity, which are thought to have =
been
observed in ourselves and in the enemy are collected into one single total
impression, out of which there springs the resolution to quit the field or =
to
renew the combat on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
This description, which is not intended as a finished picture of a modern
battle, but only to give its general tone, suits for the offensive and
defensive, and the special traits which are given, by the object proposed, =
the
country, &amp;c. &amp;c., may be introduced into it, without materially
altering the conception.
</p>

<p>
But modern battles are not so by accident; they are so because the parties =
find
themselves nearly on a level as regards military organisation and the knowl=
edge
of the Art of War, and because the warlike element inflamed by great nation=
al
interests has broken through artificial limits and now flows in its natural
channel. Under these two conditions, battles will always preserve this
character.
</p>

<p>
This general idea of the modern battle will be useful to us in the sequel i=
n
more places than one, if we want to estimate the value of the particular
co-efficients of strength, country, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is only for general,
great, and decisive combats, and such as come near to them that this
description stands good; inferior ones have changed their character also in=
 the
same direction but less than great ones. The proof of this belongs to tacti=
cs;
we shall, however, have an opportunity hereafter of making this subject pla=
iner
by giving a few particulars.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap35"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>The Combat in General</h3>

<p>
The Combat is the real warlike activity, everything else is only its auxili=
ary;
let us therefore take an attentive look at its nature.
</p>

<p>
Combat means fighting, and in this the destruction or conquest of the enemy=
 is
the object, and the enemy, in the particular combat, is the armed force whi=
ch
stands opposed to us.
</p>

<p>
This is the simple idea; we shall return to it, but before we can do that w=
e
must insert a series of others.
</p>

<p>
If we suppose the State and its military force as a unit, then the most nat=
ural
idea is to imagine the War also as one great combat, and in the simple
relations of savage nations it is also not much otherwise. But our Wars are
made up of a number of great and small simultaneous or consecutive combats,=
 and
this severance of the activity into so many separate actions is owing to th=
e
great multiplicity of the relations out of which War arises with us.
</p>

<p>
In point of fact, the ultimate object of our Wars, the political one, is no=
t
always quite a simple one; and even were it so, still the action is bound u=
p
with such a number of conditions and considerations to be taken into accoun=
t,
that the object can no longer be attained by one single great act but only
through a number of greater or smaller acts which are bound up into a whole=
;
each of these separate acts is therefore a part of a whole, and has
consequently a special object by which it is bound to this whole.
</p>

<p>
We have already said that every strategic act can be referred to the idea o=
f a
combat, because it is an employment of the military force, and at the root =
of
that there always lies the idea of fighting. We may therefore reduce every
military activity in the province of Strategy to the unit of single combats=
,
and occupy ourselves with the object of these only; we shall get acquainted
with these special objects by degrees as we come to speak of the causes whi=
ch
produce them; here we content ourselves with saying that every combat, grea=
t or
small, has its own peculiar object in subordination to the main object. If =
this
is the case then, the destruction and conquest of the enemy is only to be
regarded as the means of gaining this object; as it unquestionably is.
</p>

<p>
But this result is true only in its form, and important only on account of =
the
connection which the ideas have between themselves, and we have only sought=
 it
out to get rid of it at once.
</p>

<p>
What is overcoming the enemy? Invariably the destruction of his military fo=
rce,
whether it be by death, or wounds, or any means; whether it be completely o=
r
only to such a degree that he can no longer continue the contest; therefore=
 as
long as we set aside all special objects of combats, we may look upon the
complete or partial destruction of the enemy as the only object of all comb=
ats.
</p>

<p>
Now we maintain that in the majority of cases, and especially in great batt=
les,
the special object by which the battle is individualised and bound up with =
the
great whole is only a weak modification of that general object, or an ancil=
lary
object bound up with it, important enough to individualise the battle, but
always insignificant in comparison with that general object; so that if tha=
t
ancillary object alone should be obtained, only an unimportant part of the
purpose of the combat is fulfilled. If this assertion is correct, then we s=
ee
that the idea, according to which the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s fo=
rce is
only the means, and something else always the object, can only be true in f=
orm,
but, that it would lead to false conclusions if we did not recollect that t=
his
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force is comprised in that object, and t=
hat
this object is only a weak modification of it. Forgetfulness of this led to
completely false views before the Wars of the last period, and created
tendencies as well as fragments of systems, in which theory thought it rais=
ed
itself so much the more above handicraft, the less it supposed itself to st=
and
in need of the use of the real instrument, that is the destruction of the
enemy=E2=80=99s force.
</p>

<p>
Certainly such a system could not have arisen unless supported by other fal=
se
suppositions, and unless in place of the destruction of the enemy, other th=
ings
had been substituted to which an efficacy was ascribed which did not rightl=
y
belong to them. We shall attack these falsehoods whenever occasion requires=
,
but we could not treat of the combat without claiming for it the real
importance and value which belong to it, and giving warning against the err=
ors
to which merely formal truth might lead.
</p>

<p>
But now how shall we manage to show that in most cases, and in those of mos=
t
importance, the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army is the chief thing?=
 How
shall we manage to combat that extremely subtle idea, which supposes it
possible, through the use of a special artificial form, to effect by a smal=
l
direct destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces a much greater destruction
indirectly, or by means of small but extremely well-directed blows to produ=
ce
such paralysation of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces, such a command over the
enemy=E2=80=99s will, that this mode of proceeding is to be viewed as a gre=
at
shortening of the road? Undoubtedly a victory at one point may be of more v=
alue
than at another. Undoubtedly there is a scientific arrangement of battles
amongst themselves, even in Strategy, which is in fact nothing but the Art =
of
thus arranging them. To deny that is not our intention, but we assert that =
the
direct destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces is everywhere predominant;=
 we
contend here for the overruling importance of this destructive principle an=
d
nothing else.
</p>

<p>
We must, however, call to mind that we are now engaged with Strategy, not w=
ith
tactics, therefore we do not speak of the means which the former may have o=
f
destroying at a small expense a large body of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces, b=
ut
under direct destruction we understand the tactical results, and that,
therefore, our assertion is that only great tactical results can lead to gr=
eat
strategical ones, or, as we have already once before more distinctly expres=
sed
it, <i>the tactical successes</i> are of paramount importance in the conduc=
t of War.
</p>

<p>
The proof of this assertion seems to us simple enough, it lies in the time
which every complicated (artificial) combination requires. The question whe=
ther
a simple attack, or one more carefully prepared, <i>i.e.</i>, more artifici=
al, will
produce greater effects, may undoubtedly be decided in favour of the latter=
 as
long as the enemy is assumed to remain quite passive. But every carefully
combined attack requires time for its preparation, and if a counter-stroke =
by
the enemy intervenes, our whole design may be upset. Now if the enemy shoul=
d
decide upon some simple attack, which can be executed in a shorter time, th=
en
he gains the initiative, and destroys the effect of the great plan. Therefo=
re,
together with the expediency of a complicated attack we must consider all t=
he
dangers which we run during its preparation, and should only adopt it if th=
ere
is no reason to fear that the enemy will disconcert our scheme. Whenever th=
is
is the case we must ourselves choose the simpler, <i>i.e.</i>, quicker way,=
 and lower
our views in this sense as far as the character, the relations of the enemy=
,
and other circumstances may render necessary. If we quit the weak impressio=
ns
of abstract ideas and descend to the region of practical life, then it is
evident that a bold, courageous, resolute enemy will not let us have time f=
or
wide-reaching skilful combinations, and it is just against such a one we sh=
ould
require skill the most. By this it appears to us that the advantage of simp=
le
and direct results over those that are complicated is conclusively shown.
</p>

<p>
Our opinion is not on that account that the simple blow is the best, but th=
at
we must not lift the arm too far for the time given to strike, and that thi=
s
condition will always lead more to direct conflict the more warlike our
opponent is. Therefore, far from making it our aim to gain upon the enemy b=
y
complicated plans, we must rather seek to be beforehand with him by greater
simplicity in our designs.
</p>

<p>
If we seek for the lowest foundation-stones of these converse propositions =
we
find that in the one it is ability, in the other, courage. Now, there is
something very attractive in the notion that a moderate degree of courage
joined to great ability will produce greater effects than moderate ability =
with
great courage. But unless we suppose these elements in a disproportionate
relation, not logical, we have no right to assign to ability this advantage
over courage in a field which is called danger, and which must be regarded =
as
the true domain of courage.
</p>

<p>
After this abstract view we shall only add that experience, very far from
leading to a different conclusion, is rather the sole cause which has impel=
led
us in this direction, and given rise to such reflections.
</p>

<p>
Whoever reads history with a mind free from prejudice cannot fail to arrive=
 at
a conviction that of all military virtues, energy in the conduct of operati=
ons
has always contributed the most to the glory and success of arms.
</p>

<p>
How we make good our principle of regarding the destruction of the
enemy=E2=80=99s force as the principal object, not only in the War as a who=
le but
also in each separate combat, and how that principle suits all the forms an=
d
conditions necessarily demanded by the relations out of which War springs, =
the
sequel will show. For the present all that we desire is to uphold its gener=
al
importance, and with this result we return again to the combat.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap36"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>The Combat in General (<i>continu=
ation</i>)</h3>

<p>
In the last chapter we showed the destruction of the enemy as the true obje=
ct
of the combat, and we have sought to prove by a special consideration of th=
e
point, that this is true in the majority of cases, and in respect to the mo=
st
important battles, because the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army is a=
lways
the preponderating object in War. The other objects which may be mixed up w=
ith
this destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, and may have more or less
influence, we shall describe generally in the next chapter, and become bett=
er
acquainted with by degrees afterwards; here we divest the combat of them
entirely, and look upon the destruction of the enemy as the complete and
sufficient object of any combat.
</p>

<p>
What are we now to understand by destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army? A
diminution of it relatively greater than that on our own side. If we have a
great superiority in numbers over the enemy, then naturally the same absolu=
te
amount of loss on both sides is for us a smaller one than for him, and
consequently may be regarded in itself as an advantage. As we are here
considering the combat as divested of all (other) objects, we must also exc=
lude
from our consideration the case in which the combat is used only indirectly=
 for
a greater destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force; consequently also, only=
 that
direct gain which has been made in the mutual process of destruction, is to=
 be
regarded as the object, for this is an absolute gain, which runs through th=
e
whole campaign, and at the end of it will always appear as pure profit. But
every other kind of victory over our opponent will either have its motive i=
n
other objects, which we have completely excluded here, or it will only yiel=
d a
temporary relative advantage. An example will make this plain.
</p>

<p>
If by a skilful disposition we have reduced our opponent to such a dilemma,
that he cannot continue the combat without danger, and after some resistanc=
e he
retires, then we may say, that we have conquered him at that point; but if =
in
this victory we have expended just as many forces as the enemy, then in clo=
sing
the account of the campaign, there is no gain remaining from this victory, =
if
such a result can be called a victory. Therefore the overcoming the enemy, =
that
is, placing him in such a position that he must give up the fight, counts f=
or
nothing in itself, and for that reason cannot come under the definition of
object. There remains, therefore, as we have said, nothing over except the
direct gain which we have made in the process of destruction; but to this
belong not only the losses which have taken place in the course of the comb=
at,
but also those which, after the withdrawal of the conquered part, take plac=
e as
direct consequences of the same.
</p>

<p>
Now it is known by experience, that the losses in physical forces in the co=
urse
of a battle seldom present a great difference between victor and vanquished
respectively, often none at all, sometimes even one bearing an inverse rela=
tion
to the result, and that the most decisive losses on the side of the vanquis=
hed
only commence with the retreat, that is, those which the conqueror does not
share with him. The weak remains of battalions already in disorder are cut =
down
by cavalry, exhausted men strew the ground, disabled guns and broken caisso=
ns
are abandoned, others in the bad state of the roads cannot be removed quick=
ly
enough, and are captured by the enemy=E2=80=99s troops, during the night nu=
mbers
lose their way, and fall defenceless into the enemy=E2=80=99s hands, and th=
us the
victory mostly gains bodily substance after it is already decided. Here wou=
ld
be a paradox, if it did not solve itself in the following manner.
</p>

<p>
The loss in physical force is not the only one which the two sides suffer i=
n
the course of the combat; the moral forces also are shaken, broken, and go =
to
ruin. It is not only the loss in men, horses and guns, but in order, courag=
e,
confidence, cohesion and plan, which come into consideration when it is a
question whether the fight can be still continued or not. It is principally=
 the
moral forces which decide here, and in all cases in which the conqueror has
lost as heavily as the conquered, it is these alone.
</p>

<p>
The comparative relation of the physical losses is difficult to estimate in=
 a
battle, but not so the relation of the moral ones. Two things principally m=
ake
it known. The one is the loss of the ground on which the fight has taken pl=
ace,
the other the superiority of the enemy=E2=80=99s. The more our reserves hav=
e
diminished as compared with those of the enemy, the more force we have used=
 to
maintain the equilibrium; in this at once, an evident proof of the moral
superiority of the enemy is given which seldom fails to stir up in the soul=
 of
the Commander a certain bitterness of feeling, and a sort of contempt for h=
is
own troops. But the principal thing is, that men who have been engaged for =
a
long continuance of time are more or less like burnt-out cinders; their
ammunition is consumed; they have melted away to a certain extent; physical=
 and
moral energies are exhausted, perhaps their courage is broken as well. Such=
 a
force, irrespective of the diminution in its number, if viewed as an organi=
c
whole, is very different from what it was before the combat; and thus it is
that the loss of moral force may be measured by the reserves that have been
used as if it were on a foot-rule.
</p>

<p>
Lost ground and want of fresh reserves, are, therefore, usually the princip=
al
causes which determine a retreat; but at the same time we by no means exclu=
de
or desire to throw in the shade other reasons, which may lie in the
interdependence of parts of the Army, in the general plan, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Every combat is therefore the bloody and destructive measuring of the stren=
gth
of forces, physical and moral; whoever at the close has the greatest amount=
 of
both left is the conqueror.
</p>

<p>
In the combat the loss of moral force is the chief cause of the decision; a=
fter
that is given, this loss continues to increase until it reaches its
culminating-point at the close of the whole act. This then is the opportuni=
ty
the victor should seize to reap his harvest by the utmost possible restrict=
ions
of his enemy=E2=80=99s forces, the real object of engaging in the combat. O=
n the
beaten side, the loss of all order and control often makes the prolongation=
 of
resistance by individual units, by the further punishment they are certain =
to
suffer, more injurious than useful to the whole. The spirit of the mass is
broken; the original excitement about losing or winning, through which dang=
er
was forgotten, is spent, and to the majority danger now appears no longer a=
n
appeal to their courage, but rather the endurance of a cruel punishment. Th=
us
the instrument in the first moment of the enemy=E2=80=99s victory is weaken=
ed and
blunted, and therefore no longer fit to repay danger by danger.
</p>

<p>
This period, however, passes; the moral forces of the conquered will recove=
r by
degrees, order will be restored, courage will revive, and in the majority o=
f
cases there remains only a small part of the superiority obtained, often no=
ne
at all. In some cases, even, although rarely, the spirit of revenge and
intensified hostility may bring about an opposite result. On the other hand=
,
whatever is gained in killed, wounded, prisoners, and guns captured can nev=
er
disappear from the account.
</p>

<p>
The losses in a battle consist more in killed and wounded; those after the
battle, more in artillery taken and prisoners. The first the conqueror shar=
es
with the conquered, more or less, but the second not; and for that reason t=
hey
usually only take place on one side of the conflict, at least, they are
considerably in excess on one side.
</p>

<p>
Artillery and prisoners are therefore at all times regarded as the true
trophies of victory, as well as its measure, because through these things i=
ts
extent is declared beyond a doubt. Even the degree of moral superiority may=
 be
better judged of by them than by any other relation, especially if the numb=
er
of killed and wounded is compared therewith; and here arises a new power
increasing the moral effects.
</p>

<p>
We have said that the moral forces, beaten to the ground in the battle and =
in
the immediately succeeding movements, recover themselves gradually, and oft=
en
bear no traces of injury; this is the case with small divisions of the whol=
e,
less frequently with large divisions; it may, however, also be the case wit=
h
the main Army, but seldom or never in the State or Government to which the =
Army
belongs. These estimate the situation more impartially, and from a more
elevated point of view, and recognise in the number of trophies taken by th=
e
enemy, and their relation to the number of killed and wounded, only too eas=
ily
and well, the measure of their own weakness and inefficiency.
</p>

<p>
In point of fact, the lost balance of moral power must not be treated light=
ly
because it has no absolute value, and because it does not of necessity appe=
ar
in all cases in the amount of the results at the final close; it may become=
 of
such excessive weight as to bring down everything with an irresistible forc=
e.
On that account it may often become a great aim of the operations of which =
we
shall speak elsewhere. Here we have still to examine some of its fundamenta=
l
relations.
</p>

<p>
The moral effect of a victory increases, not merely in proportion to the ex=
tent
of the forces engaged, but in a progressive ratio=E2=80=94that is to say, n=
ot
only in extent, but also in its intensity. In a beaten detachment order is
easily restored. As a single frozen limb is easily revived by the rest of t=
he
body, so the courage of a defeated detachment is easily raised again by the
courage of the rest of the Army as soon as it rejoins it. If, therefore, th=
e
effects of a small victory are not completely done away with, still they ar=
e
partly lost to the enemy. This is not the case if the Army itself sustains =
a
great defeat; then one with the other fall together. A great fire attains q=
uite
a different heat from several small ones.
</p>

<p>
Another relation which determines the moral value of a victory is the numer=
ical
relation of the forces which have been in conflict with each other. To beat
many with few is not only a double success, but shows also a greater,
especially a more general superiority, which the conquered must always be
fearful of encountering again. At the same time this influence is in realit=
y
hardly observable in such a case. In the moment of real action, the notions=
 of
the actual strength of the enemy are generally so uncertain, the estimate o=
f
our own commonly so incorrect, that the party superior in numbers either do=
es
not admit the disproportion, or is very far from admitting the full truth,
owing to which, he evades almost entirely the moral disadvantages which wou=
ld
spring from it. It is only hereafter in history that the truth, long suppre=
ssed
through ignorance, vanity, or a wise discretion, makes its appearance, and =
then
it certainly casts a lustre on the Army and its Leader, but it can then do
nothing more by its moral influence for events long past.
</p>

<p>
If prisoners and captured guns are those things by which the victory
principally gains substance, its true crystallisations, then the plan of th=
e
battle should have those things specially in view; the destruction of the e=
nemy
by death and wounds appears here merely as a means to an end.
</p>

<p>
How far this may influence the dispositions in the battle is not an affair =
of
Strategy, but the decision to fight the battle is in intimate connection wi=
th
it, as is shown by the direction given to our forces, and their general
grouping, whether we threaten the enemy=E2=80=99s flank or rear, or he thre=
atens
ours. On this point, the number of prisoners and captured guns depends very
much, and it is a point which, in many cases, tactics alone cannot satisfy,
particularly if the strategic relations are too much in opposition to it.
</p>

<p>
The risk of having to fight on two sides, and the still more dangerous posi=
tion
of having no line of retreat left open, paralyse the movements and the powe=
r of
resistance; further, in case of defeat, they increase the loss, often raisi=
ng
it to its extreme point, that is, to destruction. Therefore, the rear being
endangered makes defeat more probable, and, at the same time, more decisive=
.
</p>

<p>
From this arises, in the whole conduct of the War, especially in great and
small combats, a perfect instinct to secure our own line of retreat and to
seize that of the enemy; this follows from the conception of victory, which=
, as
we have seen, is something beyond mere slaughter.
</p>

<p>
In this effort we see, therefore, the first immediate purpose in the combat=
,
and one which is quite universal. No combat is imaginable in which this eff=
ort,
either in its double or single form, does not go hand in hand with the plai=
n
and simple stroke of force. Even the smallest troop will not throw itself u=
pon
its enemy without thinking of its line of retreat, and, in most cases, it w=
ill
have an eye upon that of the enemy also.
</p>

<p>
We should have to digress to show how often this instinct is prevented from
going the direct road, how often it must yield to the difficulties arising =
from
more important considerations: we shall, therefore, rest contented with
affirming it to be a general natural law of the combat.
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, active; presses everywhere with its natural weight, and s=
o
becomes the pivot on which almost all tactical and strategic man=C5=93uvres=
 turn.
</p>

<p>
If we now take a look at the conception of victory as a whole, we find in i=
t
three elements:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. The greater loss of the enemy in physical power.
</p>

<p>
2. In moral power.
</p>

<p>
3. His open avowal of this by the relinquishment of his intentions.
</p>

<p>
The returns made up on each side of losses in killed and wounded, are never
exact, seldom truthful, and in most cases, full of intentional
misrepresentations. Even the statement of the number of trophies is seldom =
to
be quite depended on; consequently, when it is not considerable it may also
cast a doubt even on the reality of the victory. Of the loss in moral force=
s
there is no reliable measure, except in the trophies: therefore, in many ca=
ses,
the giving up the contest is the only real evidence of the victory. It is,
therefore, to be regarded as a confession of inferiority=E2=80=94as the low=
ering
of the flag, by which, in this particular instance, right and superiority a=
re
conceded to the enemy, and this degree of humiliation and disgrace, which,
however, must be distinguished from all the other moral consequences of the
loss of equilibrium, is an essential part of the victory. It is this part a=
lone
which acts upon the public opinion outside the Army, upon the people and th=
e
Government in both belligerent States, and upon all others in any way
concerned.
</p>

<p>
But renouncement of the general object is not quite identical with quitting=
 the
field of battle, even when the battle has been very obstinate and long kept=
 up;
no one says of advanced posts, when they retire after an obstinate combat, =
that
they have given up their object; even in combats aimed at the destruction o=
f
the enemy=E2=80=99s Army, the retreat from the battlefield is not always to=
 be
regarded as a relinquishment of this aim, as for instance, in retreats plan=
ned
beforehand, in which the ground is disputed foot by foot; all this belongs =
to
that part of our subject where we shall speak of the separate object of the
combat; here we only wish to draw attention to the fact that in most cases =
the
giving up of the object is very difficult to distinguish from the retiremen=
t
from the battlefield, and that the impression produced by the latter, both =
in
and out of the Army, is not to be treated lightly.
</p>

<p>
For Generals and Armies whose reputation is not made, this is in itself one=
 of
the difficulties in many operations, justified by circumstances when a
succession of combats, each ending in retreat, may appear as a succession o=
f
defeats, without being so in reality, and when that appearance may exercise=
 a
very depressing influence. It is impossible for the retreating General by
making known his real intentions to prevent the moral effect spreading to t=
he
public and his troops, for to do that with effect he must disclose his plan=
s
completely, which of course would run counter to his principal interests to=
 too
great a degree.
</p>

<p>
In order to draw attention to the special importance of this conception of
victory we shall only refer to the battle of Soor,(*) the trophies from whi=
ch
were not important (a few thousand prisoners and twenty guns), and where
Frederick proclaimed his victory by remaining for five days after on the fi=
eld
of battle, although his retreat into Silesia had been previously determined=
 on,
and was a measure natural to his whole situation. According to his own acco=
unt,
he thought he would hasten a peace by the moral effect of his victory. Now
although a couple of other successes were likewise required, namely, the ba=
ttle
at Katholisch Hennersdorf, in Lusatia, and the battle of Kesseldorf, before
this peace took place, still we cannot say that the moral effect of the bat=
tle
of Soor was <i>nil</i>.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Soor, or Sohr, Sept. 30, 1745; Hennersdorf, Nov. 23, 1745; Kealteldorf,
Dec. 15, 1745, all in the Second Silesian War.
</p>

<p>
If it is chiefly the moral force which is shaken by defeat, and if the numb=
er
of trophies reaped by the enemy mounts up to an unusual height, then the lo=
st
combat becomes a rout, but this is not the necessary consequence of every
victory. A rout only sets in when the moral force of the defeated is very
severely shaken then there often ensues a complete incapability of further
resistance, and the whole action consists of giving way, that is of flight.
</p>

<p>
Jena and Belle Alliance were routs, but not so Borodino.
</p>

<p>
Although without pedantry we can here give no single line of separation,
because the difference between the things is one of degrees, yet still the
retention of the conception is essential as a central point to give clearne=
ss
to our theoretical ideas and it is a want in our terminology that for a vic=
tory
over the enemy tantamount to a rout, and a conquest of the enemy only
tantamount to a simple victory, there is only one and the same word to use.

<h3><a name=3D"chap37"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>On the Signification of the Combat=
</h3>

<p>
Having in the preceding chapter examined the combat in its absolute form, a=
s
the miniature picture of the whole War, we now turn to the relations which =
it
bears to the other parts of the great whole. First we inquire what is more
precisely the signification of a combat.
</p>

<p>
As War is nothing else but a mutual process of destruction, then the most
natural answer in conception, and perhaps also in reality, appears to be th=
at
all the powers of each party unite in one great volume and all results in o=
ne
great shock of these masses. There is certainly much truth in this idea, an=
d it
seems to be very advisable that we should adhere to it and should on that
account look upon small combats at first only as necessary loss, like the
shavings from a carpenter=E2=80=99s plane. Still, however, the thing cannot=
 be
settled so easily.
</p>

<p>
That a multiplication of combats should arise from a fractioning of forces =
is a
matter of course, and the more immediate objects of separate combats will
therefore come before us in the subject of a fractioning of forces; but the=
se
objects, and together with them, the whole mass of combats may in a general=
 way
be brought under certain classes, and the knowledge of these classes will
contribute to make our observations more intelligible.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
Destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s military forces is in reality the object=
 of
all combats; but other objects may be joined thereto, and these other objec=
ts
may be at the same time predominant; we must therefore draw a distinction
between those in which the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces is the
principal object, and those in which it is more the means. The destruction =
of
the enemy=E2=80=99s force, the possession of a place or the possession of s=
ome
object may be the general motive for a combat, and it may be either one of
these alone or several together, in which case however usually one is the
principal motive. Now the two principal forms of War, the offensive and
defensive, of which we shall shortly speak, do not modify the first of thes=
e
motives, but they certainly do modify the other two, and therefore if we
arrange them in a scheme they would appear thus:=E2=80=94
</p>

<pre xml:space=3D"preserve">     OFFENSIVE.                              DE=
FENSIVE.
     1. Destruction of enemy=E2=80=99s force   1. Destruction of enemy=E2=
=80=99s force.
     2. Conquest of a place.           2. Defence of a place.
     3. Conquest of some object.       3. Defence of some object.
</pre>

<p>
These motives, however, do not seem to embrace completely the whole of the
subject, if we recollect that there are reconnaissances and demonstrations,=
 in
which plainly none of these three points is the object of the combat. In
reality we must, therefore, on this account be allowed a fourth class. Stri=
ctly
speaking, in reconnaissances in which we wish the enemy to show himself, in
alarms by which we wish to wear him out, in demonstrations by which we wish=
 to
prevent his leaving some point or to draw him off to another, the objects a=
re
all such as can only be attained indirectly and <i>under the pretext of one=
 of the
three objects specified in the table</i>, usually of the second; for the en=
emy
whose aim is to reconnoitre must draw up his force as if he really intended=
 to
attack and defeat us, or drive us off, &amp;c. &amp;c. But this pretended
object is not the real one, and our present question is only as to the latt=
er;
therefore, we must to the above three objects of the offensive further add =
a
fourth, which is to lead the enemy to make a false conclusion. That offensi=
ve
means are conceivable in connection with this object, lies in the nature of=
 the
thing.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand we must observe that the defence of a place may be of two
kinds, either absolute, if as a general question the point is not to be giv=
en
up, or relative if it is only required for a certain time. The latter happe=
ns
perpetually in the combats of advanced posts and rear guards.
</p>

<p>
That the nature of these different intentions of a combat must have an
essential influence on the dispositions which are its preliminaries, is a t=
hing
clear in itself. We act differently if our object is merely to drive an
enemy=E2=80=99s post out of its place from what we should if our object was=
 to
beat him completely; differently, if we mean to defend a place to the last
extremity from what we should do if our design is only to detain the enemy =
for
a certain time. In the first case we trouble ourselves little about the lin=
e of
retreat, in the latter it is the principal point, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
But these reflections belong properly to tactics, and are only introduced h=
ere
by way of example for the sake of greater clearness. What Strategy has to s=
ay
on the different objects of the combat will appear in the chapters which to=
uch
upon these objects. Here we have only a few general observations to make,
first, that the importance of the object decreases nearly in the order as t=
hey
stand above, therefore, that the first of these objects must always predomi=
nate
in the great battle; lastly, that the two last in a defensive battle are in
reality such as yield no fruit, they are, that is to say, purely negative, =
and
can, therefore, only be serviceable, indirectly, by facilitating something =
else
which is positive. <i>It is, therefore, a bad sign of the strategic situati=
on if
battles of this kind become too frequent.</i>
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap38"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>Duration of Combat</h3>

<p>
If we consider the combat no longer in itself but in relation to the other
forces of War, then its duration acquires a special importance.
</p>

<p>
This duration is to be regarded to a certain extent as a second subordinate
success. For the conqueror the combat can never be finished too quickly, fo=
r
the vanquished it can never last too long. A speedy victory indicates a hig=
her
power of victory, a tardy decision is, on the side of the defeated, some
compensation for the loss.
</p>

<p>
This is in general true, but it acquires a practical importance in its
application to those combats, the object of which is a relative defence.
</p>

<p>
Here the whole success often lies in the mere duration. This is the reason =
why
we have included it amongst the strategic elements.
</p>

<p>
The duration of a combat is necessarily bound up with its essential relatio=
ns.
These relations are, absolute magnitude of force, relation of force and of =
the
different arms mutually, and nature of the country. Twenty thousand men do =
not
wear themselves out upon one another as quickly as two thousand: we cannot
resist an enemy double or three times our strength as long as one of the sa=
me
strength; a cavalry combat is decided sooner than an infantry combat; and a
combat between infantry only, quicker than if there is artillery(*) as well=
; in
hills and forests we cannot advance as quickly as on a level country; all t=
his
is clear enough.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) The increase in the relative range of artillery and the introduction of
shrapnel has altogether modified this conclusion.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows, therefore, that strength, relation of the three arms,=
 and
position, must be considered if the combat is to fulfil an object by its
duration; but to set up this rule was of less importance to us in our prese=
nt
considerations than to connect with it at once the chief results which
experience gives us on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Even the resistance of an ordinary Division of 8000 to 10,000 men of all ar=
ms
even opposed to an enemy considerably superior in numbers, will last severa=
l
hours, if the advantages of country are not too preponderating, and if the
enemy is only a little, or not at all, superior in numbers, the combat will
last half a day. A Corps of three or four Divisions will prolong it to doub=
le
the time; an Army of 80,000 or 100,000 to three or four times. Therefore th=
e
masses may be left to themselves for that length of time, and no separate
combat takes place if within that time other forces can be brought up, whos=
e
co-operation mingles then at once into one stream with the results of the
combat which has taken place.
</p>

<p>
These calculations are the result of experience; but it is important to us =
at
the same time to characterise more particularly the moment of the decision,=
 and
consequently the termination.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap39"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>Decision of the Combat</h3>

<p>
No battle is decided in a single moment, although in every battle there ari=
se
moments of crisis, on which the result depends. The loss of a battle is,
therefore, a gradual falling of the scale. But there is in every combat a p=
oint
of time (*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Under the then existing conditions of armament understood. This point i=
s of
supreme importance, as practically the whole conduct of a great battle depe=
nds
on a correct solution of this question=E2=80=94viz., How long can a given c=
ommand
prolong its resistance? If this is incorrectly answered in practice=E2=80=
=94the
whole man=C5=93uvre depending on it may collapse=E2=80=94<i>e.g.</i>, Kouro=
upatkin at
Liao-Yang, September 1904.
</p>

<p>
when it may be regarded as decided, in such a way that the renewal of the f=
ight
would be a new battle, not a continuation of the old one. To have a clear
notion on this point of time, is very important, in order to be able to dec=
ide
whether, with the prompt assistance of reinforcements, the combat can again=
 be
resumed with advantage.
</p>

<p>
Often in combats which are beyond restoration new forces are sacrificed in
vain; often through neglect the decision has not been seized when it might
easily have been secured. Here are two examples, which could not be more to=
 the
point:
</p>

<p>
When the Prince of Hohenlohe, in 1806, at Jena,(*) with 35,000 men opposed =
to
from 60,000 to 70,000, under Buonaparte, had accepted battle, and lost
it=E2=80=94but lost it in such a way that the 35,000 might be regarded as
dissolved=E2=80=94General R=C3=BCchel undertook to renew the fight with abo=
ut 12,000;
the consequence was that in a moment his force was scattered in like manner=
.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) October 14, 1806.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, on the same day at Auerstadt, the Prussians maintained a
combat with 25,000, against Davoust, who had 28,000, until mid-day, without
success, it is true, but still without the force being reduced to a state o=
f
dissolution without even greater loss than the enemy, who was very deficien=
t in
cavalry;=E2=80=94but they neglected to use the reserve of 18,000, under Gen=
eral
Kalkreuth, to restore the battle which, under these circumstances, it would
have been impossible to lose.
</p>

<p>
Each combat is a whole in which the partial combats combine themselves into=
 one
total result. In this total result lies the decision of the combat. This
success need not be exactly a victory such as we have denoted in the sixth
chapter, for often the preparations for that have not been made, often ther=
e is
no opportunity if the enemy gives way too soon, and in most cases the decis=
ion,
even when the resistance has been obstinate, takes place before such a degr=
ee
of success is attained as would completely satisfy the idea of a victory.
</p>

<p>
We therefore ask, Which is commonly the moment of the decision, that is to =
say,
that moment when a fresh, effective, of course not disproportionate, force,=
 can
no longer turn a disadvantageous battle?
</p>

<p>
If we pass over false attacks, which in accordance with their nature are
properly without decision, then,
</p>

<p>
1. If the possession of a movable object was the object of the combat, the =
loss
of the same is always the decision.
</p>

<p>
2. If the possession of ground was the object of the combat, then the decis=
ion
generally lies in its loss. Still not always, only if this ground is of
peculiar strength, ground which is easy to pass over, however important it =
may
be in other respects, can be re-taken without much danger.
</p>

<p>
3. But in all other cases, when these two circumstances have not already
decided the combat, therefore, particularly in case the destruction of the
enemy=E2=80=99s force is the principal object, the decision is reached at t=
hat
moment when the conqueror ceases to feel himself in a state of disintegrati=
on,
that is, of unserviceableness to a certain extent, when therefore, there is=
 no
further advantage in using the successive efforts spoken of in the twelfth
chapter of the third book. On this ground we have given the strategic unity=
 of
the battle its place here.
</p>

<p>
A battle, therefore, in which the assailant has not lost his condition of o=
rder
and perfect efficiency at all, or, at least, only in a small part of his fo=
rce,
whilst the opposing forces are, more or less, disorganised throughout, is a=
lso
not to be retrieved; and just as little if the enemy has recovered his
efficiency.
</p>

<p>
The smaller, therefore, that part of a force is which has really been engag=
ed,
the greater that portion which as reserve has contributed to the result onl=
y by
its presence. So much the less will any new force of the enemy wrest again =
the
victory from our hands, and that Commander who carries out to the furthest =
with
his Army the principle of conducting the combat with the greatest economy o=
f
forces, and making the most of the moral effect of strong reserves, goes th=
e
surest way to victory. We must allow that the French, in modern times,
especially when led by Buonaparte, have shown a thorough mastery in this.
</p>

<p>
Further, the moment when the crisis-stage of the combat ceases with the
conqueror, and his original state of order is restored, takes place sooner =
the
smaller the unit he controls. A picket of cavalry pursuing an enemy at full
gallop will in a few minutes resume its proper order, and the crisis ceases=
. A
whole regiment of cavalry requires a longer time. It lasts still longer wit=
h
infantry, if extended in single lines of skirmishers, and longer again with
Divisions of all arms, when it happens by chance that one part has taken on=
e
direction and another part another direction, and the combat has therefore
caused a loss of the order of formation, which usually becomes still worse =
from
no part knowing exactly where the other is. Thus, therefore, the point of t=
ime
when the conqueror has collected the instruments he has been using, and whi=
ch
are mixed up and partly out of order, the moment when he has in some measur=
e
rearranged them and put them in their proper places, and thus brought the
battle-workshop into a little order, this moment, we say, is always later, =
the
greater the total force.

<p>
Again, this moment comes later if night overtakes the conqueror in the cris=
is,
and, lastly, it comes later still if the country is broken and thickly wood=
ed.
But with regard to these two points, we must observe that night is also a g=
reat
means of protection, and it is only seldom that circumstances favour the
expectation of a successful result from a night attack, as on March 10, 181=
4,
at Laon,(*) where York against Marmont gives us an example completely in pl=
ace
here. In the same way a wooded and broken country will afford protection
against a reaction to those who are engaged in the long crisis of victory.
Both, therefore, the night as well as the wooded and broken country are
obstacles which make the renewal of the same battle more difficult instead =
of
facilitating it.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) The celebrated charge at night upon Marmont=E2=80=99s Corps.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto, we have considered assistance arriving for the losing side as a m=
ere
increase of force, therefore, as a reinforcement coming up directly from th=
e
rear, which is the most usual case. But the case is quite different if thes=
e
fresh forces come upon the enemy in flank or rear.
</p>

<p>
On the effect of flank or rear attacks so far as they belong to Strategy, w=
e
shall speak in another place: such a one as we have here in view, intended =
for
the restoration of the combat, belongs chiefly to tactics, and is only
mentioned because we are here speaking of tactical results, our ideas,
therefore, must trench upon the province of tactics.
</p>

<p>
By directing a force against the enemy=E2=80=99s flank and rear its efficac=
y may
be much intensified; but this is so far from being a necessary result alway=
s
that the efficacy may, on the other hand, be just as much weakened. The
circumstances under which the combat has taken place decide upon this part =
of
the plan as well as upon every other, without our being able to enter there=
upon
here. But, at the same time, there are in it two things of importance for o=
ur
subject: first, <i>flank and rear attacks have, as a rule, a more favourabl=
e
effect on the consequences of the decision than upon the decision itself</i=
>. Now
as concerns the retrieving a battle, the first thing to be arrived at above=
 all
is a favourable decision and not magnitude of success. In this view one wou=
ld
therefore think that a force which comes to re-establish our combat is of l=
ess
assistance if it falls upon the enemy in flank and rear, therefore separate=
d
from us, than if it joins itself to us directly; certainly, cases are not
wanting where it is so, but we must say that the majority are on the other
side, and they are so on account of the second point which is here importan=
t to
us.
</p>

<p>
This second point <i>is the moral effect of the surprise, which, as a rule,=
 a
reinforcement coming up to re-establish a combat has generally in its favou=
r.</i>
Now the effect of a surprise is always heightened if it takes place in the
flank or rear, and an enemy completely engaged in the crisis of victory in =
his
extended and scattered order, is less in a state to counteract it. Who does=
 not
feel that an attack in flank or rear, which at the commencement of the batt=
le,
when the forces are concentrated and prepared for such an event would be of
little importance, gains quite another weight in the last moment of the com=
bat.
</p>

<p>
We must, therefore, at once admit that in most cases a reinforcement coming=
 up
on the flank or rear of the enemy will be more efficacious, will be like th=
e
same weight at the end of a longer lever, and therefore that under these
circumstances, we may undertake to restore the battle with the same force w=
hich
employed in a direct attack would be quite insufficient. Here results almos=
t
defy calculation, because the moral forces gain completely the ascendency. =
This
is therefore the right field for boldness and daring.
</p>

<p>
The eye must, therefore, be directed on all these objects, all these moment=
s of
co-operating forces must be taken into consideration, when we have to decid=
e in
doubtful cases whether or not it is still possible to restore a combat whic=
h
has taken an unfavourable turn.
</p>

<p>
If the combat is to be regarded as not yet ended, then the new contest whic=
h is
opened by the arrival of assistance fuses into the former; therefore they f=
low
together into one common result, and the first disadvantage vanishes comple=
tely
out of the calculation. But this is not the case if the combat was already
decided; then there are two results separate from each other. Now if the
assistance which arrives is only of a relative strength, that is, if it is =
not
in itself alone a match for the enemy, then a favourable result is hardly t=
o be
expected from this second combat: but if it is so strong that it can undert=
ake
the second combat without regard to the first, then it may be able by a
favourable issue to compensate or even overbalance the first combat, but ne=
ver
to make it disappear altogether from the account.
</p>

<p>
At the battle of Kunersdorf,(*) Frederick the Great at the first onset carr=
ied
the left of the Russian position, and took seventy pieces of artillery; at =
the
end of the battle both were lost again, and the whole result of the first
combat was wiped out of the account. Had it been possible to stop at the fi=
rst
success, and to put off the second part of the battle to the coming day, th=
en,
even if the King had lost it, the advantages of the first would always have
been a set off to the second.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) August 12, 1759.
</p>

<p>
But when a battle proceeding disadvantageously is arrested and turned befor=
e
its conclusion, its minus result on our side not only disappears from the
account, but also becomes the foundation of a greater victory. If, for
instance, we picture to ourselves exactly the tactical course of the battle=
, we
may easily see that until it is finally concluded all successes in partial
combats are only decisions in suspense, which by the capital decision may n=
ot
only be destroyed, but changed into the opposite. The more our forces have
suffered, the more the enemy will have expended on his side; the greater,
therefore, will be the crisis for the enemy, and the more the superiority o=
f
our fresh troops will tell. If now the total result turns in our favour, if=
 we
wrest from the enemy the field of battle and recover all the trophies again=
,
then all the forces which he has sacrificed in obtaining them become sheer =
gain
for us, and our former defeat becomes a stepping-stone to a greater triumph=
.
The most brilliant feats which with victory the enemy would have so highly
prized that the loss of forces which they cost would have been disregarded,
leave nothing now behind but regret at the sacrifice entailed. Such is the
alteration which the magic of victory and the curse of defeat produces in t=
he
specific weight of the same elements.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, even if we are decidedly superior in strength, and are able to r=
epay
the enemy his victory by a greater still, it is always better to forestall =
the
conclusion of a disadvantageous combat, if it is of proportionate importanc=
e,
so as to turn its course rather than to deliver a second battle.
</p>

<p>
Field-Marshal Daun attempted in the year 1760 to come to the assistance of
General Laudon at Leignitz, whilst the battle lasted; but when he failed, h=
e
did not attack the King next day, although he did not want for means to do =
so.
</p>

<p>
For these reasons serious combats of advance guards which precede a battle =
are
to be looked upon only as necessary evils, and when not necessary they are =
to
be avoided.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) This, however, was not Napoleon=E2=80=99s view. A vigorous attack of hi=
s
advance guard he held to be necessary always, to fix the enemy=E2=80=99s
attention and =E2=80=9Cparalyse his independent will-power.=E2=80=9D It was=
 the
failure to make this point which, in August 1870, led von Moltke repeatedly
into the very jaws of defeat, from which only the lethargy of Bazaine on th=
e
one hand and the initiative of his subordinates, notably of von Alvensleben=
,
rescued him. This is the essence of the new Strategic Doctrine of the Frenc=
h
General Staff. See the works of Bonnal, Foch, &amp;C.=E2=80=94EDITOR
</p>

<p>
We have still another conclusion to examine.
</p>

<p>
If on a regular pitched battle, the decision has gone against one, this doe=
s
not constitute a motive for determining on a new one. The determination for
this new one must proceed from other relations. This conclusion, however, i=
s
opposed by a moral force, which we must take into account: it is the feelin=
g of
rage and revenge. From the oldest Field-Marshal to the youngest drummer-boy
this feeling is general, and, therefore, troops are never in better spirits=
 for
fighting than when they have to wipe out a stain. This is, however, only on=
 the
supposition that the beaten portion is not too great in proportion to the
whole, because otherwise the above feeling is lost in that of powerlessness=
.
</p>

<p>
There is therefore a very natural tendency to use this moral force to repai=
r
the disaster on the spot, and on that account chiefly to seek another battl=
e if
other circumstances permit. It then lies in the nature of the case that thi=
s
second battle must be an offensive one.
</p>

<p>
In the catalogue of battles of second-rate importance there are many exampl=
es
to be found of such retaliatory battles; but great battles have generally t=
oo
many other determining causes to be brought on by this weaker motive.
</p>

<p>
Such a feeling must undoubtedly have led the noble Bl=C3=BCcher with his th=
ird
Corps to the field of battle on February 14, 1814, when the other two had b=
een
beaten three days before at Montmirail. Had he known that he would have com=
e
upon Buonaparte in person, then, naturally, preponderating reasons would ha=
ve
determined him to put off his revenge to another day: but he hoped to reven=
ge
himself on Marmont, and instead of gaining the reward of his desire for
honourable satisfaction, he suffered the penalty of his erroneous calculati=
on.
</p>

<p>
On the duration of the combat and the moment of its decision depend the
distances from each other at which those masses should be placed which are
intended to fight <i>in conjunction with</i> each other. This disposition w=
ould be a
tactical arrangement in so far as it relates to one and the same battle; it
can, however, only be regarded as such, provided the position of the troops=
 is
so compact that two separate combats cannot be imagined, and consequently t=
hat
the space which the whole occupies can be regarded strategically as a mere
point. But in War, cases frequently occur where even those forces intended =
to
fight <i>in unison</i> must be so far separated from each other that while =
their union
for one common combat certainly remains the principal object, still the
occurrence of separate combats remains possible. Such a disposition is
therefore strategic.
</p>

<p>
Dispositions of this kind are: marches in separate masses and columns, the
formation of advance guards, and flanking columns, also the grouping of
reserves intended to serve as supports for more than one strategic point; t=
he
concentration of several Corps from widely extended cantonments, &amp;c.
&amp;c. We can see that the necessity for these arrangements may constantly
arise, and may consider them something like the small change in the strateg=
ic
economy, whilst the capital battles, and all that rank with them are the go=
ld
and silver pieces.

<h3><a name=3D"chap40"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Mutual Understanding as to a Ba=
ttle</h3>

<p>
No battle can take place unless by mutual consent; and in this idea, which
constitutes the whole basis of a duel, is the root of a certain phraseology
used by historical writers, which leads to many indefinite and false
conceptions.
</p>

<p>
According to the view of the writers to whom we refer, it has frequently
happened that one Commander has offered battle to the other, and the latter=
 has
not accepted it.
</p>

<p>
But the battle is a very modified duel, and its foundation is not merely in=
 the
mutual wish to fight, that is in consent, but in the objects which are boun=
d up
with the battle: these belong always to a greater whole, and that so much t=
he
more, as even the whole war considered as a =E2=80=9Ccombat-unit=E2=80=9D h=
as
political objects and conditions which belong to a higher standpoint. The m=
ere
desire to conquer each other therefore falls into quite a subordinate relat=
ion,
or rather it ceases completely to be anything of itself, and only becomes t=
he
nerve which conveys the impulse of action from the higher will.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the ancients, and then again during the early period of standing
Armies, the expression that we had offered battle to the enemy in vain, had
more sense in it than it has now. By the ancients everything was constitute=
d
with a view to measuring each other=E2=80=99s strength in the open field fr=
ee
from anything in the nature of a hindrance,(*) and the whole Art of War
consisted in the organisation, and formation of the Army, that is in the or=
der
of battle.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Note the custom of sending formal challenges, fix time and place for
action, and =E2=80=9Cenhazelug=E2=80=9D the battlefield in Anglo-Saxon
times.=E2=80=94ED.
</p>

<p>
Now as their Armies regularly entrenched themselves in their camps, therefo=
re
the position in a camp was regarded as something unassailable, and a battle=
 did
not become possible until the enemy left his camp, and placed himself in a
practicable country, as it were entered the lists.
</p>

<p>
If therefore we hear about Hannibal having offered battle to Fabius in vain=
,
that tells us nothing more as regards the latter than that a battle was not
part of his plan, and in itself neither proves the physical nor moral
superiority of Hannibal; but with respect to him the expression is still
correct enough in the sense that Hannibal really wished a battle.
</p>

<p>
In the early period of modern Armies, the relations were similar in great
combats and battles. That is to say, great masses were brought into action,=
 and
managed throughout it by means of an order of battle, which like a great
helpless whole required a more or less level plain and was neither suited t=
o
attack, nor yet to defence in a broken, close or even mountainous country. =
The
defender therefore had here also to some extent the means of avoiding battl=
e.
These relations although gradually becoming modified, continued until the f=
irst
Silesian War, and it was not until the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War that attack=
s on
an enemy posted in a difficult country gradually became feasible, and of
ordinary occurrence: ground did not certainly cease to be a principle of
strength to those making use of its aid, but it was no longer a charmed cir=
cle,
which shut out the natural forces of War.
</p>

<p>
During the past thirty years War has perfected itself much more in this
respect, and there is no longer anything which stands in the way of a Gener=
al
who is in earnest about a decision by means of battle; he can seek out his
enemy, and attack him: if he does not do so he cannot take credit for havin=
g
wished to fight, and the expression he offered a battle which his opponent =
did
not accept, therefore now means nothing more than that he did not find
circumstances advantageous enough for a battle, an admission which the abov=
e
expression does not suit, but which it only strives to throw a veil over.
</p>

<p>
It is true the defensive side can no longer refuse a battle, yet he may sti=
ll
avoid it by giving up his position, and the <i>r=C3=B4le</i> with which tha=
t position was
connected: this is however half a victory for the offensive side, and an
acknowledgment of his superiority for the present.
</p>

<p>
This idea in connection with the cartel of defiance can therefore no longer=
 be
made use of in order by such rhodomontade to qualify the inaction of him wh=
ose
part it is to advance, that is, the offensive. The defender who as long as =
he
does not give way, must have the credit of willing the battle, may certainl=
y
say, he has offered it if he is not attacked, if that is not understood of
itself.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand, he who now wishes to, and can retreat cannot easily =
be
forced to give battle. Now as the advantages to the aggressor from this ret=
reat
are often not sufficient, and a substantial victory is a matter of urgent
necessity for him, in that way the few means which there are to compel such=
 an
opponent also to give battle are often sought for and applied with particul=
ar
skill.
</p>

<p>
The principal means for this are=E2=80=94first <i>surrounding</i> the enemy=
 so as to
make his retreat impossible, or at least so difficult that it is better for=
 him
to accept battle; and, secondly, <i>surprising</i> him. This last way, for =
which there
was a motive formerly in the extreme difficulty of all movements, has becom=
e in
modern times very inefficacious.
</p>

<p>
From the pliability and manoeuvring capabilities of troops in the present d=
ay,
one does not hesitate to commence a retreat even in sight of the enemy, and
only some special obstacles in the nature of the country can cause serious
difficulties in the operation.
</p>

<p>
As an example of this kind the battle of Neresheim may be given, fought by =
the
Archduke Charles with Moreau in the Rauhe Alp, August 11, 1796, merely with=
 a
view to facilitate his retreat, although we freely confess we have never be=
en
able quite to understand the argument of the renowned general and author
himself in this case.
</p>

<p>
The battle of Rosbach(*) is another example, if we suppose the commander of=
 the
allied army had not really the intention of attacking Frederick the Great.

<h4>
ITS DECISION
</h4>

<p>
What is a battle? A conflict of the main body, but not an unimportant one a=
bout
a secondary object, not a mere attempt which is given up when we see betime=
s
that our object is hardly within our reach: it is a conflict waged with all=
 our
forces for the attainment of a decisive victory.
</p>

<p>
Minor objects may also be mixed up with the principal object, and it will t=
ake
many different tones of colour from the circumstances out of which it
originates, for a battle belongs also to a greater whole of which it is onl=
y a
part, but because the essence of War is conflict, and the battle is the
conflict of the main Armies, it is always to be regarded as the real centre=
 of
gravity of the War, and therefore its distinguishing character is, that unl=
ike
all other encounters, it is arranged for, and undertaken with the sole purp=
ose
of obtaining a decisive victory.
</p>

<p>
This has an influence on the <i>manner of its decision</i>, on the <i>effec=
t of the
victory contained in it</i>, and determines <i>the value which theory is to=
 assign to
it as a means to an end.</i>
</p>

<p>
On that account we make it the subject of our special consideration, and at
this stage before we enter upon the special ends which may be bound up with=
 it,
but which do not essentially alter its character if it really deserves to b=
e
termed a battle.
</p>

<p>
If a battle takes place principally on its own account, the elements of its
decision must be contained in itself; in other words, victory must be striv=
en
for as long as a possibility or hope remains. It must not, therefore, be gi=
ven
up on account of secondary circumstances, but only and alone in the event o=
f
the forces appearing completely insufficient.
</p>

<p>
Now how is that precise moment to be described?
</p>

<p>
If a certain artificial formation and cohesion of an Army is the principal
condition under which the bravery of the troops can gain a victory, as was =
the
case during a great part of the period of the modern Art of War, <i>then th=
e
breaking up of this formation</i> is the decision. A beaten wing which is p=
ut out
of joint decides the fate of all that was connected with it. If as was the =
case
at another time the essence of the defence consists in an intimate alliance=
 of
the Army with the ground on which it fights and its obstacles, so that Army=
 and
position are only one, then the <i>conquest</i> of <i>an essential point</i=
> in this position
is the decision. It is said the key of the position is lost, it cannot
therefore be defended any further; the battle cannot be continued. In both
cases the beaten Armies are very much like the broken strings of an instrum=
ent
which cannot do their work.
</p>

<p>
That geometrical as well as this geographical principle which had a tendenc=
y to
place an Army in a state of crystallising tension which did not allow of th=
e
available powers being made use of up to the last man, have at least so far
lost their influence that they no longer predominate. Armies are still led =
into
battle in a certain order, but that order is no longer of decisive importan=
ce;
obstacles of ground are also still turned to account to strengthen a positi=
on,
but they are no longer the only support.
</p>

<p>
We attempted in the second chapter of this book to take a general view of t=
he
nature of the modern battle. According to our conception of it, the order o=
f
battle is only a disposition of the forces suitable to the convenient use o=
f
them, and the course of the battle a mutual slow wearing away of these forc=
es
upon one another, to see which will have soonest exhausted his adversary.
</p>

<p>
The resolution therefore to give up the fight arises, in a battle more than=
 in
any other combat, from the relation of the fresh reserves remaining availab=
le;
for only these still retain all their moral vigour, and the cinders of the
battered, knocked-about battalions, already burnt out in the destroying
element, must not be placed on a level with them; also lost ground as we ha=
ve
elsewhere said, is a standard of lost moral force; it therefore comes also =
into
account, but more as a sign of loss suffered than for the loss itself, and =
the
number of fresh reserves is always the chief point to be looked at by both
Commanders.
</p>

<p>
In general, an action inclines in one direction from the very commencement,=
 but
in a manner little observable. This direction is also frequently given in a
very decided manner by the arrangements which have been made previously, an=
d
then it shows a want of discernment in that General who commences battle un=
der
these unfavourable circumstances without being aware of them. Even when thi=
s
does not occur it lies in the nature of things that the course of a battle
resembles rather a slow disturbance of equilibrium which commences soon, bu=
t as
we have said almost imperceptibly at first, and then with each moment of ti=
me
becomes stronger and more visible, than an oscillating to and fro, as those=
 who
are misled by mendacious descriptions usually suppose.
</p>

<p>
But whether it happens that the balance is for a long time little disturbed=
, or
that even after it has been lost on one side it rights itself again, and is
then lost on the other side, it is certain at all events that in most insta=
nces
the defeated General foresees his fate long before he retreats, and that ca=
ses
in which some critical event acts with unexpected force upon the course of =
the
whole have their existence mostly in the colouring with which every one dep=
icts
his lost battle.
</p>

<p>
We can only here appeal to the decision of unprejudiced men of experience, =
who
will, we are sure, assent to what we have said, and answer for us to such o=
f
our readers as do not know War from their own experience. To develop the
necessity of this course from the nature of the thing would lead us too far
into the province of tactics, to which this branch of the subject belongs; =
we
are here only concerned with its results.
</p>

<p>
If we say that the defeated General foresees the unfavourable result usuall=
y
some time before he makes up his mind to give up the battle, we admit that
there are also instances to the contrary, because otherwise we should maint=
ain
a proposition contradictory in itself. If at the moment of each decisive
tendency of a battle it should be considered as lost, then also no further
forces should be used to give it a turn, and consequently this decisive
tendency could not precede the retreat by any length of time. Certainly the=
re
are instances of battles which after having taken a decided turn to one sid=
e
have still ended in favour of the other; but they are rare, not usual; thes=
e
exceptional cases, however, are reckoned upon by every General against whom
fortune declares itself, and he must reckon upon them as long as there rema=
ins
a possibility of a turn of fortune. He hopes by stronger efforts, by raisin=
g
the remaining moral forces, by surpassing himself, or also by some fortunat=
e
chance that the next moment will bring a change, and pursues this as far as=
 his
courage and his judgment can agree. We shall have something more to say on =
this
subject, but before that we must show what are the signs of the scales turn=
ing.
</p>

<p>
The result of the whole combat consists in the sum total of the results of =
all
partial combats; but these results of separate combats are settled by diffe=
rent
considerations.
</p>

<p>
First by the pure moral power in the mind of the leading officers. If a Gen=
eral
of Division has seen his battalions forced to succumb, it will have an
influence on his demeanour and his reports, and these again will have an
influence on the measures of the Commander-in-Chief; therefore even those
unsuccessful partial combats which to all appearance are retrieved, are not
lost in their results, and the impressions from them sum themselves up in t=
he
mind of the Commander without much trouble, and even against his will.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, by the quicker melting away of our troops, which can be easily
estimated in the slow and relatively(*) little tumultuary course of our
battles.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Relatively, that is say to the shock of former days.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, by lost ground.
</p>

<p>
All these things serve for the eye of the General as a compass to tell the
course of the battle in which he is embarked. If whole batteries have been =
lost
and none of the enemy=E2=80=99s taken; if battalions have been overthrown b=
y the
enemy=E2=80=99s cavalry, whilst those of the enemy everywhere present
impenetrable masses; if the line of fire from his order of battle wavers
involuntarily from one point to another; if fruitless efforts have been mad=
e to
gain certain points, and the assaulting battalions each, time been scattere=
d by
well-directed volleys of grape and case;=E2=80=94if our artillery begins to=
 reply
feebly to that of the enemy=E2=80=94if the battalions under fire diminish
unusually, fast, because with the wounded crowds of unwounded men go to the
rear;=E2=80=94if single Divisions have been cut off and made prisoners thro=
ugh
the disruption of the plan of the battle;=E2=80=94if the line of retreat be=
gins
to be endangered: the Commander may tell very well in which direction he is
going with his battle. The longer this direction continues, the more decide=
d it
becomes, so much the more difficult will be the turning, so much the nearer=
 the
moment when he must give up the battle. We shall now make some observations=
 on
this moment.
</p>

<p>
We have already said more than once that the final decision is ruled mostly=
 by
the relative number of the fresh reserves remaining at the last; that Comma=
nder
who sees his adversary is decidedly superior to him in this respect makes u=
p
his mind to retreat. It is the characteristic of modern battles that all
mischances and losses which take place in the course of the same can be
retrieved by fresh forces, because the arrangement of the modern order of
battle, and the way in which troops are brought into action, allow of their=
 use
almost generally, and in each position. So long, therefore, as that Command=
er
against whom the issue seems to declare itself still retains a superiority =
in
reserve force, he will not give up the day. But from the moment that his
reserves begin to become weaker than his enemy=E2=80=99s, the decision may =
be
regarded as settled, and what he now does depends partly on special
circumstances, partly on the degree of courage and perseverance which he
personally possesses, and which may degenerate into foolish obstinacy. How =
a
Commander can attain to the power of estimating correctly the still remaini=
ng
reserves on both sides is an affair of skilful practical genius, which does=
 not
in any way belong to this place; we keep ourselves to the result as it form=
s
itself in his mind. But this conclusion is still not the moment of decision
properly, for a motive which only arises gradually does not answer to that,=
 but
is only a general motive towards resolution, and the resolution itself requ=
ires
still some special immediate causes. Of these there are two chief ones whic=
h
constantly recur, that is, the danger of retreat, and the arrival of night.
</p>

<p>
If the retreat with every new step which the battle takes in its course bec=
omes
constantly in greater danger, and if the reserves are so much diminished th=
at
they are no longer adequate to get breathing room, then there is nothing le=
ft
but to submit to fate, and by a well-conducted retreat to save what, by a
longer delay ending in flight and disaster, would be lost.
</p>

<p>
But night as a rule puts an end to all battles, because a night combat hold=
s
out no hope of advantage except under particular circumstances; and as nigh=
t is
better suited for a retreat than the day, so, therefore, the Commander who =
must
look at the retreat as a thing inevitable, or as most probable, will prefer=
 to
make use of the night for his purpose.
</p>

<p>
That there are, besides the above two usual and chief causes, yet many othe=
rs
also, which are less or more individual and not to be overlooked, is a matt=
er
of course; for the more a battle tends towards a complete upset of equilibr=
ium
the more sensible is the influence of each partial result in hastening the
turn. Thus the loss of a battery, a successful charge of a couple of regime=
nts
of cavalry, may call into life the resolution to retreat already ripening.
</p>

<p>
As a conclusion to this subject, we must dwell for a moment on the point at
which the courage of the Commander engages in a sort of conflict with his
reason.
</p>

<p>
If, on the one hand the overbearing pride of a victorious conqueror, if the
inflexible will of a naturally obstinate spirit, if the strenuous resistanc=
e of
noble feelings will not yield the battlefield, where they must leave their
honour, yet on the other hand, reason counsels not to give up everything, n=
ot
to risk the last upon the game, but to retain as much over as is necessary =
for
an orderly retreat. However highly we must esteem courage and firmness in W=
ar,
and however little prospect there is of victory to him who cannot resolve t=
o
seek it by the exertion of all his power, still there is a point beyond whi=
ch
perseverance can only be termed desperate folly, and therefore can meet wit=
h no
approbation from any critic. In the most celebrated of all battles, that of
Belle-Alliance, Buonaparte used his last reserve in an effort to retrieve a
battle which was past being retrieved. He spent his last farthing, and then=
, as
a beggar, abandoned both the battle-field and his crown.

<h3><a name=3D"chap42"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>Effects of Victory</h3>

<p>
According to the point from which our view is taken, we may feel as much
astonished at the extraordinary results of some great battles as at the wan=
t of
results in others. We shall dwell for a moment on the nature of the effect =
of a
great victory.
</p>

<p>
Three things may easily be distinguished here: the effect upon the instrume=
nt
itself, that is, upon the Generals and their Armies; the effect upon the St=
ates
interested in the War; and the particular result of these effects as manife=
sted
in the subsequent course of the campaign.
</p>

<p>
If we only think of the trifling difference which there usually is between
victor and vanquished in killed, wounded, prisoners, and artillery lost on =
the
field of battle itself, the consequences which are developed out of this
insignificant point seem often quite incomprehensible, and yet, usually,
everything only happens quite naturally.
</p>

<p>
We have already said in the seventh chapter that the magnitude of a victory
increases not merely in the same measure as the vanquished forces increase =
in
number, but in a higher ratio. The moral effects resulting from the issue o=
f a
great battle are greater on the side of the conquered than on that of the
conqueror: they lead to greater losses in physical force, which then in tur=
n
react on the moral element, and so they go on mutually supporting and
intensifying each other. On this moral effect we must therefore lay special
weight. It takes an opposite direction on the one side from that on the oth=
er;
as it undermines the energies of the conquered so it elevates the powers an=
d
energy of the conqueror. But its chief effect is upon the vanquished, becau=
se
here it is the direct cause of fresh losses, and besides it is homogeneous =
in
nature with danger, with the fatigues, the hardships, and generally with al=
l
those embarrassing circumstances by which War is surrounded, therefore ente=
rs
into league with them and increases by their help, whilst with the conquero=
r
all these things are like weights which give a higher swing to his courage.=
 It
is therefore found, that the vanquished sinks much further below the origin=
al
line of equilibrium than the conqueror raises himself above it; on this
account, if we speak of the effects of victory we allude more particularly =
to
those which manifest themselves in the army. If this effect is more powerfu=
l in
an important combat than in a smaller one, so again it is much more powerfu=
l in
a great battle than in a minor one. The great battle takes place for the sa=
ke
of itself, for the sake of the victory which it is to give, and which is so=
ught
for with the utmost effort. Here on this spot, in this very hour, to conque=
r
the enemy is the purpose in which the plan of the War with all its threads
converges, in which all distant hopes, all dim glimmerings of the future me=
et,
fate steps in before us to give an answer to the bold question.=E2=80=94Thi=
s is
the state of mental tension not only of the Commander but of his whole Army
down to the lowest waggon-driver, no doubt in decreasing strength but also =
in
decreasing importance.
</p>

<p>
According to the nature of the thing, a great battle has never at any time =
been
an unprepared, unexpected, blind routine service, but a grand act, which,
partly of itself and partly from the aim of the Commander, stands out from
amongst the mass of ordinary efforts, sufficiently to raise the tension of =
all
minds to a higher degree. But the higher this tension with respect to the
issue, the more powerful must be the effect of that issue.
</p>

<p>
Again, the moral effect of victory in our battles is greater than it was in=
 the
earlier ones of modern military history. If the former are as we have depic=
ted
them, a real struggle of forces to the utmost, then the sum total of all th=
ese
forces, of the physical as well as the moral, must decide more than certain
special dispositions or mere chance.
</p>

<p>
A single fault committed may be repaired next time; from good fortune and
chance we can hope for more favour on another occasion; but the sum total o=
f
moral and physical powers cannot be so quickly altered, and, therefore, wha=
t
the award of a victory has decided appears of much greater importance for a=
ll
futurity. Very probably, of all concerned in battles, whether in or out of =
the
Army, very few have given a thought to this difference, but the course of t=
he
battle itself impresses on the minds of all present in it such a conviction=
,
and the relation of this course in public documents, however much it may be
coloured by twisting particular circumstances, shows also, more or less, to=
 the
world at large that the causes were more of a general than of a particular
nature.
</p>

<p>
He who has not been present at the loss of a great battle will have difficu=
lty
in forming for himself a living or quite true idea of it, and the abstract
notions of this or that small untoward affair will never come up to the per=
fect
conception of a lost battle. Let us stop a moment at the picture.
</p>

<p>
The first thing which overpowers the imagination=E2=80=94and we may indeed =
say,
also the understanding=E2=80=94is the diminution of the masses; then the lo=
ss of
ground, which takes place always, more or less, and, therefore, on the side=
 of
the assailant also, if he is not fortunate; then the rupture of the origina=
l
formation, the jumbling together of troops, the risks of retreat, which, wi=
th
few exceptions may always be seen sometimes in a less sometimes in a greate=
r
degree; next the retreat, the most part of which commences at night, or, at
least, goes on throughout the night. On this first march we must at once le=
ave
behind, a number of men completely worn out and scattered about, often just=
 the
bravest, who have been foremost in the fight who held out the longest: the
feeling of being conquered, which only seized the superior officers on the
battlefield, now spreads through all ranks, even down to the common soldier=
s,
aggravated by the horrible idea of being obliged to leave in the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
hands so many brave comrades, who but a moment since were of such value to =
us
in the battle, and aggravated by a rising distrust of the chief, to whom, m=
ore
or less, every subordinate attributes as a fault the fruitless efforts he h=
as
made; and this feeling of being conquered is no ideal picture over which on=
e
might become master; it is an evident truth that the enemy is superior to u=
s; a
truth of which the causes might have been so latent before that they were n=
ot
to be discovered, but which, in the issue, comes out clear and palpable, or
which was also, perhaps, before suspected, but which in the want of any
certainty, we had to oppose by the hope of chance, reliance on good fortune=
,
Providence or a bold attitude. Now, all this has proved insufficient, and t=
he
bitter truth meets us harsh and imperious.
</p>

<p>
All these feelings are widely different from a panic, which in an army
fortified by military virtue never, and in any other, only exceptionally,
follows the loss of a battle. They must arise even in the best of Armies, a=
nd
although long habituation to War and victory together with great confidence=
 in
a Commander may modify them a little here and there, they are never entirel=
y
wanting in the first moment. They are not the pure consequences of lost
trophies; these are usually lost at a later period, and the loss of them do=
es
not become generally known so quickly; they will therefore not fail to appe=
ar
even when the scale turns in the slowest and most gradual manner, and they
constitute that effect of a victory upon which we can always count in every
case.
</p>

<p>
We have already said that the number of trophies intensifies this effect.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that an Army in this condition, looked at as an instrument, i=
s
weakened! How can we expect that when reduced to such a degree that, as we =
said
before, it finds new enemies in all the ordinary difficulties of making War=
, it
will be able to recover by fresh efforts what has been lost! Before the bat=
tle
there was a real or assumed equilibrium between the two sides; this is lost=
,
and, therefore, some external assistance is requisite to restore it; every =
new
effort without such external support can only lead to fresh losses.
</p>

<p>
Thus, therefore, the most moderate victory of the chief Army must tend to c=
ause
a constant sinking of the scale on the opponent=E2=80=99s side, until new
external circumstances bring about a change. If these are not near, if the
conqueror is an eager opponent, who, thirsting for glory, pursues great aim=
s,
then a first-rate Commander, and in the beaten Army a true military spirit,
hardened by many campaigns are required, in order to stop the swollen strea=
m of
prosperity from bursting all bounds, and to moderate its course by small bu=
t
reiterated acts of resistance, until the force of victory has spent itself =
at
the goal of its career.
</p>

<p>
And now as to the effect of defeat beyond the Army, upon the Nation and
Government! It is the sudden collapse of hopes stretched to the utmost, the
downfall of all self-reliance. In place of these extinct forces, fear, with=
 its
destructive properties of expansion, rushes into the vacuum left, and compl=
etes
the prostration. It is a real shock upon the nerves, which one of the two
athletes receives from the electric spark of victory. And that effect, howe=
ver
different in its degrees, is never completely wanting. Instead of every one
hastening with a spirit of determination to aid in repairing the disaster,
every one fears that his efforts will only be in vain, and stops, hesitatin=
g
with himself, when he should rush forward; or in despondency he lets his ar=
m
drop, leaving everything to fate.
</p>

<p>
The consequence which this effect of victory brings forth in the course of =
the
War itself depend in part on the character and talent of the victorious
General, but more on the circumstances from which the victory proceeds, and=
 to
which it leads. Without boldness and an enterprising spirit on the part of =
the
leader, the most brilliant victory will lead to no great success, and its f=
orce
exhausts itself all the sooner on circumstances, if these offer a strong an=
d
stubborn opposition to it. How very differently from Daun, Frederick the Gr=
eat
would have used the victory at Kollin; and what different consequences Fran=
ce,
in place of Prussia, might have given a battle of Leuthen!
</p>

<p>
The conditions which allow us to expect great results from a great victory =
we
shall learn when we come to the subjects with which they are connected; the=
n it
will be possible to explain the disproportion which appears at first sight
between the magnitude of a victory and its results, and which is only too
readily attributed to a want of energy on the part of the conqueror. Here,
where we have to do with the great battle in itself, we shall merely say th=
at
the effects now depicted never fail to attend a victory, that they mount up
with the intensive strength of the victory=E2=80=94mount up more the more t=
he
whole strength of the Army has been concentrated in it, the more the whole
military power of the Nation is contained in that Army, and the State in th=
at
military power.
</p>

<p>
But then the question may be asked, Can theory accept this effect of victor=
y as
absolutely necessary?=E2=80=94must it not rather endeavour to find out
counteracting means capable of neutralising these effects? It seems quite
natural to answer this question in the affirmative; but heaven defend us fr=
om
taking that wrong course of most theories, out of which is begotten a mutua=
lly
devouring <i>Pro et Contra</i>.
</p>

<p>
Certainly that effect is perfectly necessary, for it has its foundation in =
the
nature of things, and it exists, even if we find means to struggle against =
it;
just as the motion of a cannon ball is always in the direction of the
terrestrial, although when fired from east to west part of the general velo=
city
is destroyed by this opposite motion.
</p>

<p>
All War supposes human weakness, and against that it is directed.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if hereafter in another place we examine what is to be done afte=
r
the loss of a great battle, if we bring under review the resources which st=
ill
remain, even in the most desperate cases, if we should express a belief in =
the
possibility of retrieving all, even in such a case; it must not be supposed=
 we
mean thereby that the effects of such a defeat can by degrees be completely
wiped out, for the forces and means used to repair the disaster might have =
been
applied to the realisation of some positive object; and this applies both t=
o
the moral and physical forces.
</p>

<p>
Another question is, whether, through the loss of a great battle, forces ar=
e
not perhaps roused into existence, which otherwise would never have come to
life. This case is certainly conceivable, and it is what has actually occur=
red
with many Nations. But to produce this intensified reaction is beyond the
province of military art, which can only take account of it where it might =
be
assumed as a possibility.
</p>

<p>
If there are cases in which the fruits of a victory appear rather of a
destructive nature in consequence of the reaction of the forces which it ha=
d
the effect of rousing into activity=E2=80=94cases which certainly are very
exceptional=E2=80=94then it must the more surely be granted, that there is =
a
difference in the effects which one and the same victory may produce accord=
ing
to the character of the people or state, which has been conquered.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap43"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>The Use of the Battle</h3>

<p>
Whatever form the conduct of War may take in particular cases, and whatever=
 we
may have to admit in the sequel as necessary respecting it: we have only to
refer to the conception of War to be convinced of what follows:
</p>

<p>
1. The destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s military force, is the leading
principle of War, and for the whole chapter of positive action the direct w=
ay
to the object.
</p>

<p>
2. This destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, must be principally effec=
ted by
means of battle.
</p>

<p>
3. Only great and general battles can produce great results.
</p>

<p>
4. The results will be greatest when combats unite themselves in one great
battle.
</p>

<p>
5. It is only in a great battle that the General-in-Chief commands in perso=
n,
and it is in the nature of things, that he should place more confidence in
himself than in his subordinates.
</p>

<p>
From these truths a double law follows, the parts of which mutually support
each other; namely, that the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s military fo=
rce is
to be sought for principally by great battles, and their results; and that =
the
chief object of great battles must be the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99=
s
military force.
</p>

<p>
No doubt the annihilation-principle is to be found more or less in other
means=E2=80=94granted there are instances in which through favourable
circumstances in a minor combat, the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s for=
ces
has been disproportionately great (Maxen), and on the other hand in a battl=
e,
the taking or holding a single post may be predominant in importance as an
object=E2=80=94but as a general rule it remains a paramount truth, that bat=
tles
are only fought with a view to the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army,=
 and
that this destruction can only be effected by their means.
</p>

<p>
The battle may therefore be regarded as War concentrated, as the centre of
effort of the whole War or campaign. As the sun=E2=80=99s rays unite in the=
 focus
of the concave mirror in a perfect image, and in the fulness of their heat;=
 to
the forces and circumstances of War, unite in a focus in the great battle f=
or
one concentrated utmost effort.
</p>

<p>
The very assemblage of forces in one great whole, which takes place more or
less in all Wars, indicates an intention to strike a decisive blow with thi=
s
whole, either voluntarily as assailant, or constrained by the opposite part=
y as
defender. When this great blow does not follow, then some modifying, and
retarding motives have attached themselves to the original motive of hostil=
ity,
and have weakened, altered or completely checked the movement. But also, ev=
en
in this condition of mutual inaction which has been the key-note in so many
Wars, the idea of a possible battle serves always for both parties as a poi=
nt
of direction, a distant focus in the construction of their plans. The more =
War
is War in earnest, the more it is a venting of animosity and hostility, a
mutual struggle to overpower, so much the more will all activities join dea=
dly
contest, and also the more prominent in importance becomes the battle.
</p>

<p>
In general, when the object aimed at is of a great and positive nature, one
therefore in which the interests of the enemy are deeply concerned, the bat=
tle
offers itself as the most natural means; it is, therefore, also the best as=
 we
shall show more plainly hereafter: and, as a rule, when it is evaded from
aversion to the great decision, punishment follows.
</p>

<p>
The positive object belong to the offensive, and therefore the battle is al=
so
more particularly his means. But without examining the conception of offens=
ive
and defensive more minutely here, we must still observe that, even for the
defender in most cases, there is no other effectual means with which to mee=
t
the exigencies of his situation, to solve the problem presented to him.
</p>

<p>
The battle is the bloodiest way of solution. True, it is not merely recipro=
cal
slaughter, and its effect is more a killing of the enemy=E2=80=99s courage =
than
of the enemy=E2=80=99s soldiers, as we shall see more plainly in the next
chapter=E2=80=94but still blood is always its price, and slaughter its char=
acter
as well as name;(*) from this the humanity in the General=E2=80=99s mind re=
coils
with horror.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) =E2=80=9C<i>Schlacht</i>=E2=80=9D, from schlachten =3D to slaughter.
</p>

<p>
But the soul of the man trembles still more at the thought of the decision =
to
be given with one single blow. <i>in one point</i> of space and time all ac=
tion is
here pressed together, and at such a moment there is stirred up within us a=
 dim
feeling as if in this narrow space all our forces could not develop themsel=
ves
and come into activity, as if we had already gained much by mere time, alth=
ough
this time owes us nothing at all. This is all mere illusion, but even as
illusion it is something, and the same weakness which seizes upon the man i=
n
every other momentous decision may well be felt more powerfully by the Gene=
ral,
when he must stake interests of such enormous weight upon one venture.
</p>

<p>
Thus, then, Statesmen and Generals have at all times endeavoured to avoid t=
he
decisive battle, seeking either to attain their aim without it, or dropping
that aim unperceived. Writers on history and theory have then busied themse=
lves
to discover in some other feature in these campaigns not only an equivalent=
 for
the decision by battle which has been avoided, but even a higher art. In th=
is
way, in the present age, it came very near to this, that a battle in the
economy of War was looked upon as an evil, rendered necessary through some
error committed, a morbid paroxysm to which a regular prudent system of War
would never lead: only those Generals were to deserve laurels who knew how =
to
carry on War without spilling blood, and the theory of War=E2=80=94a real
business for Brahmins=E2=80=94was to be specially directed to teaching this=
.
</p>

<p>
Contemporary history has destroyed this illusion,(*) but no one can guarant=
ee
that it will not sooner or later reproduce itself, and lead those at the he=
ad
of affairs to perversities which please man=E2=80=99s weakness, and therefo=
re
have the greater affinity for his nature. Perhaps, by-and-by,
Buonaparte=E2=80=99s campaigns and battles will be looked upon as mere acts=
 of
barbarism and stupidity, and we shall once more turn with satisfaction and
confidence to the dress-sword of obsolete and musty institutions and forms.=
 If
theory gives a caution against this, then it renders a real service to thos=
e
who listen to its warning voice. <i>May we succeed in lending a hand to tho=
se who
in our dear native land are called upon to speak with authority on these
matters, that we may be their guide into this field of inquiry, and excite =
them
to make a candid examination of the subject</i>.(**)

decision only in a great battle. From time immemorial, only great victories
have led to great successes on the offensive side in the absolute form, on =
the
defensive side in a manner more or less satisfactory. Even Buonaparte would=
 not
have seen the day of Ulm, unique in its kind, if he had shrunk from sheddin=
g
blood; it is rather to be regarded as only a second crop from the victoriou=
s
events in his preceding campaigns. It is not only bold, rash, and presumptu=
ous
Generals who have sought to complete their work by the great venture of a
decisive battle, but also fortunate ones as well; and we may rest satisfied
with the answer which they have thus given to this vast question.
</p>

<p>
Let us not hear of Generals who conquer without bloodshed. If a bloody
slaughter is a horrible sight, then that is a ground for paying more respec=
t to
War, but not for making the sword we wear blunter and blunter by degrees fr=
om
feelings of humanity, until some one steps in with one that is sharp and lo=
ps
off the arm from our body.
</p>

<p>
We look upon a great battle as a principal decision, but certainly not as t=
he
only one necessary for a War or a campaign. Instances of a great battle
deciding a whole campaign, have been frequent only in modern times, those w=
hich
have decided a whole War, belong to the class of rare exceptions.
</p>

<p>
A decision which is brought about by a great battle depends naturally not o=
n
the battle itself, that is on the mass of combatants engaged in it, and on =
the
intensity of the victory, but also on a number of other relations between t=
he
military forces opposed to each other, and between the States to which thes=
e
forces belong. But at the same time that the principal mass of the force
available is brought to the great duel, a great decision is also brought on=
,
the extent of which may perhaps be foreseen in many respects, though not in
all, and which although not the only one, still is the <i>first</i> decisio=
n, and as
such, has an influence on those which succeed. Therefore a deliberately pla=
nned
great battle, according to its relations, is more or less, but always in so=
me
degree, to be regarded as the leading means and central point of the whole
system. The more a General takes the field in the true spirit of War as wel=
l as
of every contest, with the feeling and the idea, that is the conviction, th=
at
he must and will conquer, the more he will strive to throw every weight int=
o
the scale in the first battle, hope and strive to win everything by it.
Buonaparte hardly ever entered upon a War without thinking of conquering hi=
s
enemy at once in the first battle,(*) and Frederick the Great, although in =
a
more limited sphere, and with interests of less magnitude at stake, thought=
 the
same when, at the head of a small Army, he sought to disengage his rear fro=
m
the Russians or the Federal Imperial Army.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) This was Moltke=E2=80=99s essential idea in his preparations for the Wa=
r of
1870. See his secret memorandum issued to G.O.C.s on May 7. 1870, pointing =
to a
battle on the Upper Saar as his primary purpose.=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<p>
The decision which is given by the great battle, depends, we have said, par=
tly
on the battle itself, that is on the number of troops engaged, and partly o=
n
the magnitude of the success.
</p>

<p>
How the General may increase its importance in respect to the first point i=
s
evident in itself and we shall merely observe that according to the importa=
nce
of the great battle, the number of cases which are decided along with it
increases, and that therefore Generals who, confident in themselves have be=
en
lovers of great decisions, have always managed to make use of the greater p=
art
of their troops in it without neglecting on that account essential points
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
As regards the consequences or speaking more correctly the effectiveness of=
 a
victory, that depends chiefly on four points:
</p>

<p>
1. On the tactical form adopted as the order of battle.
</p>

<p>
2. On the nature of the country.
</p>

<p>
3. On the relative proportions of the three arms.
</p>

<p>
4. On the relative strength of the two Armies.
</p>

<p>
A battle with parallel fronts and without any action against a flank will
seldom yield as great success as one in which the defeated Army has been
turned, or compelled to change front more or less. In a broken or hilly cou=
ntry
the successes are likewise smaller, because the power of the blow is everyw=
here
less.
</p>

<p>
If the cavalry of the vanquished is equal or superior to that of the victor=
,
then the effects of the pursuit are diminished, and by that great part of t=
he
results of victory are lost.
</p>

<p>
Finally it is easy to understand that if superior numbers are on the side o=
f
the conqueror, and he uses his advantage in that respect to turn the flank =
of
his adversary, or compel him to change front, greater results will follow t=
han
if the conqueror had been weaker in numbers than the vanquished. The battle=
 of
Leuthen may certainly be quoted as a practical refutation of this principle=
,
but we beg permission for once to say what we otherwise do not like, <i>no =
rule
without an exception.</i>
</p>

<p>
In all these ways, therefore, the Commander has the means of giving his bat=
tle
a decisive character; certainly he thus exposes himself to an increased amo=
unt
of danger, but his whole line of action is subject to that dynamic law of t=
he
moral world.
</p>

<p>
There is then nothing in War which can be put in comparison with the great
battle in point of importance, <i>and the acme of strategic ability is disp=
layed
in the provision of means for this great event, in the skilful determinatio=
n of
place and time, and direction of troops, and in the good use made of succes=
s.</i>
</p>

<p>
But it does not follow from the importance of these things that they must b=
e of
a very complicated and recondite nature; all is here rather simple, the art=
 of
combination by no means great; but there is great need of quickness in judg=
ing
of circumstances, need of energy, steady resolution, a youthful spirit of
enterprise=E2=80=94heroic qualities, to which we shall often have to refer.=
 There
is, therefore, but little wanted here of that which can be taught by books =
and
there is much that, if it can be taught at all, must come to the General
through some other medium than printer=E2=80=99s type.
</p>

<p>
The impulse towards a great battle, the voluntary, sure progress to it, mus=
t
proceed from a feeling of innate power and a clear sense of the necessity; =
in
other words, it must proceed from inborn courage and from perceptions sharp=
ened
by contact with the higher interests of life.
</p>

<p>
Great examples are the best teachers, but it is certainly a misfortune if a
cloud of theoretical prejudices comes between, for even the sunbeam is
refracted and tinted by the clouds. To destroy such prejudices, which many =
a
time rise and spread themselves like a miasma, is an imperative duty of the=
ory,
for the misbegotten offspring of human reason can also be in turn destroyed=
 by
pure reason.

<p>
The more difficult part, viz., that of perfectly preparing the victory, is =
a
silent service of which the merit belongs to Strategy and yet for which it =
is
hardly sufficiently commended. It appears brilliant and full of renown by
turning to good account a victory gained.
</p>

<p>
What may be the special object of a battle, how it is connected with the wh=
ole
system of a War, whither the career of victory may lead according to the na=
ture
of circumstances, where its culminating-point lies=E2=80=94all these are th=
ings
which we shall not enter upon until hereafter. But under any conceivable
circumstances the fact holds good, that without a pursuit no victory can ha=
ve a
great effect, and that, however short the career of victory may be, it must
always lead beyond the first steps in pursuit; and in order to avoid the
frequent repetition of this, we shall now dwell for a moment on this necess=
ary
supplement of victory in general.
</p>

<p>
The pursuit of a beaten Army commences at the moment that Army, giving up t=
he
combat, leaves its position; all previous movements in one direction and
another belong not to that but to the progress of the battle itself. Usuall=
y
victory at the moment here described, even if it is certain, is still as ye=
t
small and weak in its proportions, and would not rank as an event of any gr=
eat
positive advantage if not completed by a pursuit on the first day. Then it =
is
mostly, as we have before said, that the trophies which give substance to t=
he
victory begin to be gathered up. Of this pursuit we shall speak in the next
place.
</p>

<p>
Usually both sides come into action with their physical powers considerably
deteriorated, for the movements immediately preceding have generally the
character of very urgent circumstances. The efforts which the forging out o=
f a
great combat costs, complete the exhaustion; from this it follows that the
victorious party is very little less disorganised and out of his original
formation than the vanquished, and therefore requires time to reform, to
collect stragglers, and issue fresh ammunition to those who are without. Al=
l
these things place the conqueror himself in the state of crisis of which we
have already spoken. If now the defeated force is only a detached portion o=
f
the enemy=E2=80=99s Army, or if it has otherwise to expect a considerable
reinforcement, then the conqueror may easily run into the obvious danger of
having to pay dear for his victory, and this consideration, in such a case,
very soon puts an end to pursuit, or at least restricts it materially. Even
when a strong accession of force by the enemy is not to be feared, the
conqueror finds in the above circumstances a powerful check to the vivacity=
 of
his pursuit. There is no reason to fear that the victory will be snatched a=
way,
but adverse combats are still possible, and may diminish the advantages whi=
ch
up to the present have been gained. Moreover, at this moment the whole weig=
ht
of all that is sensuous in an Army, its wants and weaknesses, are dependent=
 on
the will of the Commander. All the thousands under his command require rest=
 and
refreshment, and long to see a stop put to toil and danger for the present;
only a few, forming an exception, can see and feel beyond the present momen=
t,
it is only amongst this little number that there is sufficient mental vigou=
r to
think, after what is absolutely necessary at the moment has been done, upon
those results which at such a moment only appear to the rest as mere
embellishments of victory=E2=80=94as a luxury of triumph. But all these tho=
usands
have a voice in the council of the General, for through the various steps o=
f
the military hierarchy these interests of the sensuous creature have their =
sure
conductor into the heart of the Commander. He himself, through mental and
bodily fatigue, is more or less weakened in his natural activity, and thus =
it
happens then that, mostly from these causes, purely incidental to human nat=
ure,
less is done than might have been done, and that generally what is done is =
to
be ascribed entirely to the <i>thirst for glory</i>, the <i>energy</i>, ind=
eed also the
<i>hard-heartedness</i> of the General-in-Chief. It is only thus we can exp=
lain the
hesitating manner in which many Generals follow up a victory which superior
numbers have given them. The first pursuit of the enemy we limit in general=
 to
the extent of the first day, including the night following the victory. At =
the
end of that period the necessity of rest ourselves prescribes a halt in any
case.
</p>

<p>
This first pursuit has different natural degrees.
</p>

<p>
The first is, if cavalry alone are employed; in that case it amounts usuall=
y
more to alarming and watching than to pressing the enemy in reality, becaus=
e
the smallest obstacle of ground is generally sufficient to check the pursui=
t.
Useful as cavalry may be against single bodies of broken demoralised troops=
,
still when opposed to the bulk of the beaten Army it becomes again only the
auxiliary arm, because the troops in retreat can employ fresh reserves to c=
over
the movement, and, therefore, at the next trifling obstacle of ground, by
combining all arms they can make a stand with success. The only exception t=
o
this is in the case of an army in actual flight in a complete state of
dissolution.
</p>

<p>
The second degree is, if the pursuit is made by a strong advance-guard comp=
osed
of all arms, the greater part consisting naturally of cavalry. Such a pursu=
it
generally drives the enemy as far as the nearest strong position for his
rear-guard, or the next position affording space for his Army. Neither can
usually be found at once, and, therefore, the pursuit can be carried furthe=
r;
generally, however, it does not extend beyond the distance of one or at mos=
t a
couple of leagues, because otherwise the advance-guard would not feel itsel=
f
sufficiently supported. The third and most vigorous degree is when the
victorious Army itself continues to advance as far as its physical powers c=
an
endure. In this case the beaten Army will generally quit such ordinary
positions as a country usually offers on the mere show of an attack, or of =
an
intention to turn its flank; and the rear-guard will be still less likely t=
o
engage in an obstinate resistance.
</p>

<p>
In all three cases the night, if it sets in before the conclusion of the wh=
ole
act, usually puts an end to it, and the few instances in which this has not
taken place, and the pursuit has been continued throughout the night, must =
be
regarded as pursuits in an exceptionally vigorous form.
</p>

<p>
If we reflect that in fighting by night everything must be, more or less,
abandoned to chance, and that at the conclusion of a battle the regular
cohesion and order of things in an army must inevitably be disturbed, we ma=
y
easily conceive the reluctance of both Generals to carrying on their busine=
ss
under such disadvantageous conditions. If a complete dissolution of the
vanquished Army, or a rare superiority of the victorious Army in military
virtue does not ensure success, everything would in a manner be given up to
fate, which can never be for the interest of any one, even of the most
fool-hardy General. As a rule, therefore, night puts an end to pursuit, eve=
n
when the battle has only been decided shortly before darkness sets in. This
allows the conquered either time for rest and to rally immediately, or, if =
he
retreats during the night it gives him a march in advance. After this break=
 the
conquered is decidedly in a better condition; much of that which had been
thrown into confusion has been brought again into order, ammunition has bee=
n
renewed, the whole has been put into a fresh formation. Whatever further
encounter now takes place with the enemy is a new battle not a continuation=
 of
the old, and although it may be far from promising absolute success, still =
it
is a fresh combat, and not merely a gathering up of the <i>d=C3=A9bris</i> =
by the victor.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, the conqueror can continue the pursuit itself throughout t=
he
night, if only with a strong advance-guard composed of all arms of the serv=
ice,
the effect of the victory is immensely increased, of this the battles of
Leuthen and La Belle Alliance(*) are examples.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
The whole action of this pursuit is mainly tactical, and we only dwell upon=
 it
here in order to make plain the difference which through it may be produced=
 in
the effect of a victory.
</p>

<p>
This first pursuit, as far as the nearest stopping-point, belongs as a righ=
t to
every conqueror, and is hardly in any way connected with his further plans =
and
combinations. These may considerably diminish the positive results of a vic=
tory
gained with the main body of the Army, but they cannot make this first use =
of
it impossible; at least cases of that kind, if conceivable at all, must be =
so
uncommon that they should have no appreciable influence on theory. And here
certainly we must say that the example afforded by modern Wars opens up qui=
te a
new field for energy. In preceding Wars, resting on a narrower basis, and
altogether more circumscribed in their scope, there were many unnecessary
conventional restrictions in various ways, but particularly in this point. =
<i>The
conception, Honour of Victory</i> seemed to Generals so much by far the chi=
ef thing
that they thought the less of the complete destruction of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
military force, as in point of fact that destruction of force appeared to t=
hem
only as one of the many means in War, not by any means as the principal, mu=
ch
less as the only means; so that they the more readily put the sword in its
sheath the moment the enemy had lowered his. Nothing seemed more natural to
them than to stop the combat as soon as the decision was obtained, and to
regard all further carnage as unnecessary cruelty. Even if this false
philosophy did not determine their resolutions entirely, still it was a poi=
nt
of view by which representations of the exhaustion of all powers, and physi=
cal
impossibility of continuing the struggle, obtained readier evidence and gre=
ater
weight. Certainly the sparing one=E2=80=99s own instrument of victory is a =
vital
question if we only possess this one, and foresee that soon the time may ar=
rive
when it will not be sufficient for all that remains to be done, for every
continuation of the offensive must lead ultimately to complete exhaustion. =
But
this calculation was still so far false, as the further loss of forces by a
continuance of the pursuit could bear no proportion to that which the enemy
must suffer. That view, therefore, again could only exist because the milit=
ary
forces were not considered the vital factor. And so we find that in former =
Wars
real heroes only=E2=80=94such as Charles XII., Marlborough, Eugene, Frederi=
ck the
Great=E2=80=94added a vigorous pursuit to their victories when they were de=
cisive
enough, and that other Generals usually contented themselves with the
possession of the field of battle. In modern times the greater energy infus=
ed
into the conduct of Wars through the greater importance of the circumstance=
s
from which they have proceeded has thrown down these conventional barriers;=
 the
pursuit has become an all-important business for the conqueror; trophies ha=
ve
on that account multiplied in extent, and if there are cases also in modern
Warfare in which this has not been the case, still they belong to the list =
of
exceptions, and are to be accounted for by peculiar circumstances.
</p>

<p>
At Gorschen(*) and Bautzen nothing but the superiority of the allied cavalr=
y
prevented a complete rout, at Gross Beeren and Dennewitz the ill-will of
Bernadotte, the Crown Prince of Sweden; at Laon the enfeebled personal
condition of Bl=C3=BCcher, who was then seventy years old and at the moment
confined to a dark room owing to an injury to his eyes.

</p>

<p>
But Borodino is also an illustration to the point here, and we cannot resis=
t
saying a few more words about it, partly because we do not consider the
circumstances are explained simply by attaching blame to Buonaparte, partly
because it might appear as if this, and with it a great number of similar
cases, belonged to that class which we have designated as so extremely rare=
,
cases in which the general relations seize and fetter the General at the ve=
ry
beginning of the battle. French authors in particular, and great admirers o=
f
Buonaparte (Vaudancourt, Chambray, S=C3=A9gur), have blamed him decidedly
because he did not drive the Russian Army completely off the field, and use=
 his
last reserves to scatter it, because then what was only a lost battle would
have been a complete rout. We should be obliged to diverge too far to descr=
ibe
circumstantially the mutual situation of the two Armies; but this much is
evident, that when Buonaparte passed the Niemen with his Army the same corp=
s
which afterwards fought at Borodino numbered 300,000 men, of whom now only
120,000 remained, he might therefore well be apprehensive that he would not
have enough left to march upon Moscow, the point on which everything seemed=
 to
depend. The victory which he had just gained gave him nearly a certainty of
taking that capital, for that the Russians would be in a condition to fight=
 a
second battle within eight days seemed in the highest degree improbable; an=
d in
Moscow he hoped to find peace. No doubt the complete dispersion of the Russ=
ian
Army would have made this peace much more certain; but still the first
consideration was to get to Moscow, that is, to get there with a force with
which he should appear dictator over the capital, and through that over the
Empire and the Government. The force which he brought with him to Moscow wa=
s no
longer sufficient for that, as shown in the sequel, but it would have been
still less so if, in scattering the Russian Army, he had scattered his own =
at
the same time. Buonaparte was thoroughly alive to all this, and in our eyes=
 he
stands completely justified. But on that account this case is still not to =
be
reckoned amongst those in which, through the general relations, the General=
 is
interdicted from following up his victory, for there never was in his case =
any
question of mere pursuit. The victory was decided at four o=E2=80=99clock i=
n the
afternoon, but the Russians still occupied the greater part of the field of
battle; they were not yet disposed to give up the ground, and if the attack=
 had
been renewed, they would still have offered a most determined resistance, w=
hich
would have undoubtedly ended in their complete defeat, but would have cost =
the
conqueror much further bloodshed. We must therefore reckon the Battle of
Borodino as amongst battles, like Bautzen, left unfinished. At Bautzen the
vanquished preferred to quit the field sooner; at Borodino the conqueror
preferred to content himself with a half victory, not because the decision
appeared doubtful, but because he was not rich enough to pay for the whole.
</p>

<p>
Returning now to our subject, the deduction from our reflections in relatio=
n to
the first stage of pursuit is, that the energy thrown into it chiefly
determines the value of the victory; that this pursuit is a second act of t=
he
victory, in many cases more important also than the first, and that strateg=
y,
whilst here approaching tactics to receive from it the harvest of success,
exercises the first act of her authority by demanding this completion of th=
e
victory.
</p>

<p>
But further, the effects of victory are very seldom found to stop with this
first pursuit; now first begins the real career to which victory lent veloc=
ity.
This course is conditioned as we have already said, by other relations of w=
hich
it is not yet time to speak. But we must here mention, what there is of a
general character in the pursuit in order to avoid repetition when the subj=
ect
occurs again.
</p>

<p>
In the further stages of pursuit, again, we can distinguish three degrees: =
the
simple pursuit, a hard pursuit, and a parallel march to intercept.
</p>

<p>
The simple <i>following</i> or <i>pursuing</i> causes the enemy to continue=
 his retreat,
until he thinks he can risk another battle. It will therefore in its effect
suffice to exhaust the advantages gained, and besides that, all that the en=
emy
cannot carry with him, sick, wounded, and disabled from fatigue, quantities=
 of
baggage, and carriages of all kinds, will fall into our hands, but this mer=
e
following does not tend to heighten the disorder in the enemy=E2=80=99s Arm=
y, an
effect which is produced by the two following causes.
</p>

<p>
If, for instance, instead of contenting ourselves with taking up every day =
the
camp the enemy has just vacated, occupying just as much of the country as h=
e
chooses to abandon, we make our arrangements so as every day to encroach
further, and accordingly with our advance-guard organised for the purpose,
attack his rear-guard every time it attempts to halt, then such a course wi=
ll
hasten his retreat, and consequently tend to increase his
disorganisation.=E2=80=94This it will principally effect by the character o=
f
continuous flight, which his retreat will thus assume. Nothing has such a
depressing influence on the soldier, as the sound of the enemy=E2=80=99s ca=
nnon
afresh at the moment when, after a forced march he seeks some rest; if this
excitement is continued from day to day for some time, it may lead to a
complete rout. There lies in it a constant admission of being obliged to ob=
ey
the law of the enemy, and of being unfit for any resistance, and the
consciousness of this cannot do otherwise than weaken the moral of an Army =
in a
high degree. The effect of pressing the enemy in this way attains a maximum
when it drives the enemy to make night marches. If the conqueror scares awa=
y
the discomfited opponent at sunset from a camp which has just been taken up
either for the main body of the Army, or for the rear-guard, the conquered =
must
either make a night march, or alter his position in the night, retiring fur=
ther
away, which is much the same thing; the victorious party can on the other h=
and
pass the night in quiet.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement of marches, and the choice of positions depend in this case
also upon so many other things, especially on the supply of the Army, on st=
rong
natural obstacles in the country, on large towns, &amp;c. &amp;c., that it
would be ridiculous pedantry to attempt to show by a geometrical analysis h=
ow
the pursuer, being able to impose his laws on the retreating enemy, can com=
pel
him to march at night while he takes his rest. But nevertheless it is true =
and
practicable that marches in pursuit may be so planned as to have this tende=
ncy,
and that the efficacy of the pursuit is very much enchanced thereby. If thi=
s is
seldom attended to in the execution, it is because such a procedure is more
difficult for the pursuing Army, than a regular adherence to ordinary march=
es
in the daytime. To start in good time in the morning, to encamp at mid-day,=
 to
occupy the rest of the day in providing for the ordinary wants of the Army,=
 and
to use the night for repose, is a much more convenient method than to regul=
ate
one=E2=80=99s movements exactly according to those of the enemy, therefore =
to
determine nothing till the last moment, to start on the march, sometimes in=
 the
morning, sometimes in the evening, to be always for several hours in the
presence of the enemy, and exchanging cannon shots with him, and keeping up
skirmishing fire, to plan man=C5=93uvres to turn him, in short, to make the=
 whole
outlay of tactical means which such a course renders necessary. All that
naturally bears with a heavy weight on the pursuing Army, and in War, where
there are so many burdens to be borne, men are always inclined to strip off
those which do not seem absolutely necessary. These observations are true,
whether applied to a whole Army or as in the more usual case, to a strong
advance-guard. For the reasons just mentioned, this second method of pursui=
t,
this continued pressing of the enemy pursued is rather a rare occurrence; e=
ven
Buonaparte in his Russian campaign, 1812, practised it but little, for the
reasons here apparent, that the difficulties and hardships of this campaign=
,
already threatened his Army with destruction before it could reach its obje=
ct;
on the other hand, the French in their other campaigns have distinguished
themselves by their energy in this point also.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the third and most effectual form of pursuit is, the parallel march=
 to
the immediate object of the retreat.
</p>

<p>
Every defeated Army will naturally have behind it, at a greater or less
distance, some point, the attainment of which is the first purpose in view,
whether it be that failing in this its further retreat might be compromised=
, as
in the case of a defile, or that it is important for the point itself to re=
ach
it before the enemy, as in the case of a great city, magazines, &amp;c., or=
,
lastly, that the Army at this point will gain new powers of defence, such a=
s a
strong position, or junction with other corps.
</p>

<p>
Now if the conqueror directs his march on this point by a lateral road, it =
is
evident how that may quicken the retreat of the beaten Army in a destructiv=
e
manner, convert it into hurry, perhaps into flight.(*) The conquered has on=
ly
three ways to counteract this: the first is to throw himself in front of th=
e
enemy, in order by an unexpected attack to gain that probability of success
which is lost to him in general from his position; this plainly supposes an
enterprising bold General, and an excellent Army, beaten but not utterly
defeated; therefore, it can only be employed by a beaten Army in very few
cases.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) This point is exceptionally well treated by von Bernhardi in his
=E2=80=9CCavalry in Future Wars.=E2=80=9D London: Murray, 1906.
</p>

<p>
The second way is hastening the retreat; but this is just what the conquero=
r
wants, and it easily leads to immoderate efforts on the part of the troops,=
 by
which enormous losses are sustained, in stragglers, broken guns, and carria=
ges
of all kinds.
</p>

<p>
The third way is to make a <i>d=C3=A9tour</i>, and get round the nearest po=
int of
interception, to march with more ease at a greater distance from the enemy,=
 and
thus to render the haste required less damaging. This last way is the worst=
 of
all, it generally turns out like a new debt contracted by an insolvent debt=
or,
and leads to greater embarrassment. There are cases in which this course is
advisable; others where there is nothing else left; also instances in which=
 it
has been successful; but upon the whole it is certainly true that its adopt=
ion
is usually influenced less by a clear persuasion of its being the surest wa=
y of
attaining the aim than by another inadmissible motive=E2=80=94this motive i=
s the
dread of encountering the enemy. Woe to the Commander who gives in to this!
However much the moral of his Army may have deteriorated, and however well
founded may be his apprehensions of being at a disadvantage in any conflict
with the enemy, the evil will only be made worse by too anxiously avoiding
every possible risk of collision. Buonaparte in 1813 would never have broug=
ht
over the Rhine with him the 30,000 or 40,000 men who remained after the bat=
tle
of Hanau,(*) if he had avoided that battle and tried to pass the Rhine at
Mannheim or Coblenz. It is just by means of small combats carefully prepare=
d
and executed, and in which the defeated army being on the defensive, has al=
ways
the assistance of the ground=E2=80=94it is just by these that the moral str=
ength
of the Army can first be resuscitated.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) At Hanau (October 30, 1813), the Bavarians some 50,000 strong threw
themselves across the line of Napoleon=E2=80=99s retreat from Leipsic. By a
masterly use of its artillery the French tore the Bavarians asunder and mar=
ched
on over their bodies.=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<p>
The beneficial effect of the smallest successes is incredible; but with mos=
t
Generals the adoption of this plan implies great self-command. The other wa=
y,
that of evading all encounter, appears at first so much easier, that there =
is a
natural preference for its adoption. It is therefore usually just this syst=
em
of evasion which best, promotes the view of the pursuer, and often ends wit=
h
the complete downfall of the pursued; we must, however, recollect here that=
 we
are speaking of a whole Army, not of a single Division, which, having been =
cut
off, is seeking to join the main Army by making a <i>d=C3=A9tour;</i> in su=
ch a case
circumstances are different, and success is not uncommon. But there is one
condition requisite to the success of this race of two Corps for an object,
which is that a Division of the pursuing army should follow by the same roa=
d
which the pursued has taken, in order to pick up stragglers, and keep up th=
e
impression which the presence of the enemy never fails to make. Bl=C3=BCche=
r
neglected this in his, in other respects unexceptionable, pursuit after La
Belle Alliance.
</p>

<p>
Such marches tell upon the pursuer as well as the pursued, and they are not
advisable if the enemy=E2=80=99s Army rallies itself upon another considera=
ble
one; if it has a distinguished General at its head, and if its destruction =
is
not already well prepared. But when this means can be adopted, it acts also
like a great mechanical power. The losses of the beaten Army from sickness =
and
fatigue are on such a disproportionate scale, the spirit of the Army is so
weakened and lowered by the constant solicitude about impending ruin, that =
at
last anything like a well organised stand is out of the question; every day
thousands of prisoners fall into the enemy=E2=80=99s hands without striking=
 a
blow. In such a season of complete good fortune, the conqueror need not
hesitate about dividing his forces in order to draw into the vortex of
destruction everything within reach of his Army, to cut off detachments, to
take fortresses unprepared for defence, to occupy large towns, &amp;c. &amp=
;c.
He may do anything until a new state of things arises, and the more he vent=
ures
in this way the longer will it be before that change will take place. There=
 is
no want of examples of brilliant results from grand decisive victories, and=
 of
great and vigorous pursuits in the wars of Buonaparte. We need only quote J=
ena
1806, Ratisbonne 1809, Leipsic 1813, and Belle- Alliance 1815.

<h3><a name=3D"chap45"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>Retreat After a Lost Battle</h3=
>

<p>
In a lost battle the power of an Army is broken, the moral to a greater deg=
ree
than the physical. A second battle unless fresh favourable circumstances co=
me
into play, would lead to a complete defeat, perhaps, to destruction. This i=
s a
military axiom. According to the usual course the retreat is continued up t=
o
that point where the equilibrium of forces is restored, either by
reinforcements, or by the protection of strong fortresses, or by great
defensive positions afforded by the country, or by a separation of the
enemy=E2=80=99s force. The magnitude of the losses sustained, the extent of=
 the
defeat, but still more the character of the enemy, will bring nearer or put=
 off
the instant of this equilibrium. How many instances may be found of a beate=
n
Army rallied again at a short distance, without its circumstances having
altered in any way since the battle. The cause of this may be traced to the
moral weakness of the adversary, or to the preponderance gained in the batt=
le
not having been sufficient to make lasting impression.
</p>

<p>
To profit by this weakness or mistake of the enemy, not to yield one inch
breadth more than the pressure of circumstances demands, but above all thin=
gs,
in order to keep up the moral forces to as advantageous a point as possible=
, a
slow retreat, offering incessant resistance, and bold courageous
counterstrokes, whenever the enemy seeks to gain any excessive advantages, =
are
absolutely necessary. Retreats of great Generals and of Armies inured to Wa=
r
have always resembled the retreat of a wounded lion, such is, undoubtedly, =
also
the best theory.
</p>

<p>
It is true that at the moment of quitting a dangerous position we have ofte=
n
seen trifling formalities observed which caused a waste of time, and were,
therefore, attended with danger, whilst in such cases everything depends on
getting out of the place speedily. Practised Generals reckon this maxim a v=
ery
important one. But such cases must not be confounded with a general retreat
after a lost battle. Whoever then thinks by a few rapid marches to gain a
start, and more easily to recover a firm standing, commits a great error. T=
he
first movements should be as small as possible, and it is a maxim in genera=
l
not to suffer ourselves to be dictated to by the enemy. This maxim cannot b=
e
followed without bloody fighting with the enemy at our heels, but the gain =
is
worth the sacrifice; without it we get into an accelerated pace which soon
turns into a headlong rush, and costs merely in stragglers more men than
rear-guard combats, and besides that extinguishes the last remnants of the
spirit of resistance.
</p>

<p>
A strong rear-guard composed of picked troops, commanded by the bravest
General, and supported by the whole Army at critical moments, a careful
utilisation of ground, strong ambuscades wherever the boldness of the
enemy=E2=80=99s advance-guard, and the ground, afford opportunity; in short=
, the
preparation and the system of regular small battles,=E2=80=94these are the =
means
of following this principle.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties of a retreat are naturally greater or less according as th=
e
battle has been fought under more or less favourable circumstances, and
according as it has been more or less obstinately contested. The battle of =
Jena
and La Belle-Alliance show how impossible anything like a regular retreat m=
ay
become, if the last man is used up against a powerful enemy.
</p>

<p>
Now and again it has been suggested(*) to divide for the purpose of retreat=
ing,
therefore to retreat in separate divisions or even eccentrically. Such a
separation as is made merely for convenience, and along with which concentr=
ated
action continues possible and is kept in view, is not what we now refer to;=
 any
other kind is extremely dangerous, contrary to the nature of the thing, and
therefore a great error. Every lost battle is a principle of weakness and
disorganisation; and the first and immediate desideratum is to concentrate,=
 and
in concentration to recover order, courage, and confidence. The idea of
harassing the enemy by separate corps on both flanks at the moment when he =
is
following up his victory, is a perfect anomaly; a faint-hearted pedant migh=
t be
overawed by his enemy in that manner, and for such a case it may answer; bu=
t
where we are not sure of this failing in our opponent it is better let alon=
e.
If the strategic relations after a battle require that we should cover
ourselves right and left by detachments, so much must be done, as from
circumstances is unavoidable, but this fractioning must always be regarded =
as
an evil, and we are seldom in a state to commence it the day after the batt=
le
itself.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">

If Frederick the Great after the battle of Kollin,(*) and the raising of th=

because the position of his forces, and the necessity of covering Saxony, l=
eft
him no alternative, Buonaparte after the battle of Brienne,(**) sent Marmon=
t
back to the Aube, whilst he himself passed the Seine, and turned towards
Troyes; but that this did not end in disaster, was solely owing to the
circumstance that the Allies, instead of pursuing divided their forces in l=
ike
manner, turning with the one part (Bl=C3=BCcher) towards the Marne, while w=

other (Schwartzenberg), from fear of being too weak, they advanced with

<h3><a name=3D"chap46"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>Night Fighting</h3>

<p>
The manner of conducting a combat at night, and what concerns the details o=
f
its course, is a tactical subject; we only examine it here so far as in its
totality it appears as a special strategic means.
</p>

<p>
Fundamentally every night attack is only a more vehement form of surprise. =
Now
at the first look of the thing such an attack appears quite pre-eminently
advantageous, for we suppose the enemy to be taken by surprise, the assaila=
nt
naturally to be prepared for everything which can happen. What an inequalit=
y!
Imagination paints to itself a picture of the most complete confusion on th=
e
one side, and on the other side the assailant only occupied in reaping the
fruits of his advantage. Hence the constant creation of schemes for night
attacks by those who have not to lead them, and have no responsibility, whi=
lst
these attacks seldom take place in reality.
</p>

<p>
These ideal schemes are all based on the hypothesis that the assailant know=
s
the arrangements of the defender because they have been made and announced
beforehand, and could not escape notice in his reconnaissances, and inquiri=
es;
that on the other hand, the measures of the assailant, being only taken at =
the
moment of execution, cannot be known to the enemy. But the last of these is=
 not
always quite the case, and still less is the first. If we are not so near t=
he
enemy as to have him completely under our eye, as the Austrians had Frederi=
ck
the Great before the battle of Hochkirch (1758), then all that we know of h=
is
position must always be imperfect, as it is obtained by reconnaissances,
patrols, information from prisoners, and spies, sources on which no firm
reliance can be placed because intelligence thus obtained is always more or
less of an old date, and the position of the enemy may have been altered in=
 the
meantime. Moreover, with the tactics and mode of encampment of former times=
 it
was much easier than it is now to examine the position of the enemy. A line=
 of
tents is much easier to distinguish than a line of huts or a bivouac; and a=
n
encampment on a line of front, fully and regularly drawn out, also easier t=
han
one of Divisions formed in columns, the mode often used at present. We may =
have
the ground on which a Division bivouacs in that manner completely under our
eye, and yet not be able to arrive at any accurate idea.
</p>

<p>
But the position again is not all that we want to know the measures which t=
he
defender may take in the course of the combat are just as important, and do=
 not
by any means consist in mere random shots. These measures also make night
attacks more difficult in modern Wars than formerly, because they have in t=
hese
campaigns an advantage over those already taken. In our combats the positio=
n of
the defender is more temporary than definitive, and on that account the
defender is better able to surprise his adversary with unexpected blows, th=
an
he could formerly.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) All these difficulties obviously become increased as the power of the
weapons in use tends to keep the combatants further apart.=E2=80=94EDITOR.
</p>

<p>
Therefore what the assailant knows of the defensive previous to a night att=
ack,
is seldom or never sufficient to supply the want of direct observation.
</p>

<p>
But the defender has on his side another small advantage as well, which is =
that
he is more at home than the assailant, on the ground which forms his positi=
on,
and therefore, like the inhabitant of a room, will find his way about it in=
 the
dark with more ease than a stranger. He knows better where to find each par=
t of
his force, and therefore can more readily get at it than is the case with h=
is
adversary.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows, that the assailant in a combat at night feels the wan=
t of
his eyes just as much as the defender, and that therefore, only particular
reasons can make a night attack advisable.
</p>

<p>
Now these reasons arise mostly in connection with subordinate parts of an A=
rmy,
rarely with the Army itself; it follows that a night attack also as a rule =
can
only take place with secondary combats, and seldom with great battles.
</p>

<p>
We may attack a portion of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army with a very superior fo=
rce,
consequently enveloping it with a view either to take the whole, or to infl=
ict
very severe loss on it by an unequal combat, provided that other circumstan=
ces
are in our favour. But such a scheme can never succeed except by a great
surprise, because no fractional part of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army would enga=
ge in
such an unequal combat, but would retire instead. But a surprise on an
important scale except in rare instances in a very close country, can only =
be
effected at night. If therefore we wish to gain such an advantage as this f=
rom
the faulty disposition of a portion of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army, then we mu=
st
make use of the night, at all events, to finish the preliminary part even i=
f
the combat itself should not open till towards daybreak. This is therefore =
what
takes place in all the little enterprises by night against outposts, and ot=
her
small bodies, the main point being invariably through superior numbers, and
getting round his position, to entangle him unexpectedly in such a
disadvantageous combat, that he cannot disengage himself without great loss=
.
</p>

<p>
The larger the body attacked the more difficult the undertaking, because a
strong force has greater resources within itself to maintain the fight long
enough for help to arrive.
</p>

<p>
On that account the whole of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army can never in ordinary=
 cases
be the object of such an attack for although it has no assistance to expect
from any quarter outside itself, still, it contains within itself sufficien=
t
means of repelling attacks from several sides particularly in our day, when
every one from the commencement is prepared for this very usual form of att=
ack.
Whether the enemy can attack us on several sides with success depends gener=
ally
on conditions quite different from that of its being done unexpectedly; wit=
hout
entering here into the nature of these conditions, we confine ourselves to
observing, that with turning an enemy, great results, as well as great dang=
ers
are connected; that therefore, if we set aside special circumstances, nothi=
ng
justifies it but a great superiority, just such as we should use against a
fractional part of the enemy=E2=80=99s Army.
</p>

<p>
But the turning and surrounding a small fraction of the enemy, and particul=
arly
in the darkness of night, is also more practicable for this reason, that
whatever we stake upon it, and however superior the force used may be, stil=
l
probably it constitutes only a limited portion of our Army, and we can soon=
er
stake that than the whole on the risk of a great venture. Besides, the grea=
ter
part or perhaps the whole serves as a support and rallying-point for the
portion risked, which again very much diminishes the danger of the enterpri=
se.
</p>

<p>
Not only the risk, but the difficulty of execution as well confines night
enterprises to small bodies. As surprise is the real essence of them so als=
o
stealthy approach is the chief condition of execution: but this is more eas=
ily
done with small bodies than with large, and for the columns of a whole Army=
 is
seldom practicable. For this reason such enterprises are in general only
directed against single outposts, and can only be feasible against greater
bodies if they are without sufficient outposts, like Frederick the Great at
Hochkirch.(*) This will happen seldomer in future to Armies themselves than=
 to
minor divisions.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) October 14, 1758.
</p>

<p>
In recent times, when War has been carried on with so much more rapidity an=
d
vigour, it has in consequence often happened that Armies have encamped very
close to each other, without having a very strong system of outposts, becau=
se
those circumstances have generally occurred just at the crisis which preced=
es a
great decision.
</p>

<p>
But then at such times the readiness for battle on both sides is also more
perfect; on the other hand, in former Wars it was a frequent practice for
armies to take up camps in sight of each other, when they had no other obje=
ct
but that of mutually holding each other in check, consequently for a longer
period. How often Frederick the Great stood for weeks so near to the Austri=
ans,
that the two might have exchanged cannon shots with each other.
</p>

<p>
But these practices, certainly more favourable to night attacks, have been
discontinued in later days; and armies being now no longer in regard to
subsistence and requirements for encampment, such independent bodies comple=
te
in themselves, find it necessary to keep usually a day=E2=80=99s march betw=
een
themselves and the enemy. If we now keep in view especially the night attac=
k of
an army, it follows that sufficient motives for it can seldom occur, and th=
at
they fall under one or other of the following classes.
</p>

<p>
1. An unusual degree of carelessness or audacity which very rarely occurs, =
and
when it does is compensated for by a great superiority in moral force.
</p>

<p>
2. A panic in the enemy=E2=80=99s army, or generally such a degree of super=
iority
in moral force on our side, that this is sufficient to supply the place of
guidance in action.
</p>

<p>
3. Cutting through an enemy=E2=80=99s army of superior force, which keeps u=
s
enveloped, because in this all depends on surprise, and the object of merel=
y
making a passage by force, allows a much greater concentration of forces.
</p>

<p>
4. Finally, in desperate cases, when our forces have such a disproportion t=
o
the enemy=E2=80=99s, that we see no possibility of success, except through
extraordinary daring.
</p>

<p>
But in all these cases there is still the condition that the enemy=E2=80=99=
s army
is under our eyes, and protected by no advance-guard.
</p>

<p>
As for the rest, most night combats are so conducted as to end with dayligh=
t,
so that only the approach and the first attack are made under cover of
darkness, because the assailant in that manner can better profit by the
consequences of the state of confusion into which he throws his adversary; =
and
combats of this description which do not commence until daybreak, in which =
the
night therefore is only made use of to approach, are not to be counted as n=
ight
combats.

<h3><a name=3D"chap48"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>Theatre of War, Army, Campaign</h=
3>

<p>
The nature of the things does not allow of a completely satisfactory defini=
tion
of these three factors, denoting respectively, space, mass, and time in war=
;
but that we may not sometimes be quite misunderstood, we must try to make
somewhat plainer the usual meaning of these terms, to which we shall in mos=
t
cases adhere.
</p>

<h4>
1.=E2=80=94Theatre of War.
</h4>

<p>
This term denotes properly such a portion of the space over which war preva=
ils
as has its boundaries protected, and thus possesses a kind of independence.
This protection may consist in fortresses, or important natural obstacles
presented by the country, or even in its being separated by a considerable
distance from the rest of the space embraced in the war.=E2=80=94Such a por=
tion
is not a mere piece of the whole, but a small whole complete in itself; and
consequently it is more or less in such a condition that changes which take
place at other points in the seat of war have only an indirect and no direc=
t
influence upon it. To give an adequate idea of this, we may suppose that on
this portion an advance is made, whilst in another quarter a retreat is tak=
ing
place, or that upon the one an army is acting defensively, whilst an offens=
ive
is being carried on upon the other. Such a clearly defined idea as this is =
not
capable of universal application; it is here used merely to indicate the li=
ne
of distinction.
</p>

<h4>
2.=E2=80=94Army.
</h4>

<p>
With the assistance of the conception of a Theatre of War, it is very easy =
to
say what an Army is: it is, in point of fact, the mass of troops in the sam=
e
Theatre of War. But this plainly does not include all that is meant by the =
term
in its common usage. Bl=C3=BCcher and Wellington commanded each a separate =
army in
1815, although the two were in the same Theatre of War. The chief command i=
s,
therefore, another distinguishing sign for the conception of an Army. At th=
e
same time this sign is very nearly allied to the preceding, for where thing=
s
are well organised, there should only exist one supreme command in a Theatr=
e of
War, and the commander-in-chief in a particular Theatre of War should alway=
s
have a proportionate degree of independence.
</p>

<p>
The mere absolute numerical strength of a body of troops is less decisive o=
n
the subject than might at first appear. For where several Armies are acting
under one command, and upon one and the same Theatre of War, they are calle=
d
Armies, not by reason of their strength, but from the relations antecedent =
to
the war (1813, the Silesian Army, the Army of the North, etc), and although=
 we
should divide a great mass of troops intended to remain in the same Theatre
into corps, we should never divide them into Armies, at least, such a divis=
ion
would be contrary to what seems to be the meaning which is universally atta=
ched
to the term. On the other hand, it would certainly be pedantry to apply the
term Army to each band of irregular troops acting independently in a remote
province: still we must not leave unnoticed that it surprises no one when t=
he
Army of the Vendeans in the Revolutionary War is spoken of, and yet it was =
not
much stronger.
</p>

<p>
The conceptions of Army and Theatre of War therefore, as a rule, go togethe=
r,
and mutually include each other.
</p>

<h4>
3.=E2=80=94Campaign.
</h4>

<p>
Although the sum of all military events which happen in all the Theatres of=
 War
in one year is often called a <i>Campaign</i>, still, however, it is more u=
sual
and more exact to understand by the term the events in <i>one single</i>
Theatre of War. But it is worse still to connect the notion of a Campaign w=
ith
the period of one year, for wars no longer divide themselves naturally into
Campaigns of a year=E2=80=99s duration by fixed and long periods in winter
quarters. As, however, the events in a Theatre of War of themselves form
certain great chapters=E2=80=94if, for instance, the direct effects of some=
 more
or less great catastrophe cease, and new combinations begin to develop
themselves=E2=80=94therefore these natural subdivisions must be taken into
consideration in order to allot to each year (Campaign) its complete share =
of
events. No one would make the Campaign of 1812 terminate at Memel, where th=

armies were on the 1st January, and transfer the further retreat of the Fre=
nch
until they recrossed the Elbe to the campaign of 1813, as that further retr=

was plainly only a part of the whole retreat from Moscow.

That we cannot give these conceptions any greater degree of distinctness is=

no consequence, because they cannot be used as philosophical definitions fo=

<h3><a name=3D"chap49"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>Relation of Power</h3>

<p>
In the eighth chapter of the third book we have spoken of the value of supe=
rior
numbers in battles, from which follows as a consequence the superiority of
numbers in general in strategy. So far the importance of the relations of p=
ower
is established: we shall now add a few more detailed considerations on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
An unbiassed examination of modern military history leads to the conviction
that the <i>superiority in numbers becomes every day more decisive;</i> the
principle of assembling the greatest possible numbers for a decisive battle=
 may
therefore be regarded as more important than ever.
</p>

<p>
Courage and the spirit of an army have, in all ages, multiplied its physica=
l
powers, and will continue to do so equally in future; but we find also that=
 at
certain periods in history a superiority in the organisation and equipment =
of
an army has given a great moral preponderance; we find that at other period=
s a
great superiority in mobility had a like effect; at one time we see a new
system of tactics brought to light; at another we see the art of war develo=
ping
itself in an effort to make a skilful use of ground on great general
principles, and by such means here and there we find one general gaining gr=
eat
advantages over another; but even this tendency has disappeared, and wars n=
ow
go on in a simpler and more natural manner.=E2=80=94If, divesting ourselves=
 of
any preconceived notions, we look at the experiences of recent wars, we mus=
t
admit that there are but little traces of any of the above influences, eith=
er
throughout any whole campaign, or in engagements of a decisive
character=E2=80=94that is, the great battle, respecting which term we refer=
 to
the second chapter of the preceding book.
</p>

<p>
Armies are in our days so much on a par in regard to arms, equipment, and
drill, that there is no very notable difference between the best and the wo=
rst
in these things. A difference may still be observed, resulting from the
superior instruction of the scientific corps, but in general it only amount=
s to
this, that one is the inventor and introducer of improved appliances, which=
 the
other immediately imitates. Even the subordinate generals, leaders of corps=
 and
divisions, in all that comes within the scope of their sphere, have in gene=
ral
everywhere the same ideas and methods, so that, except the talent of the
commander-in-chief=E2=80=94a thing entirely dependent on chance, and not be=
aring
a constant relation to the standard of education amongst the people and the
army=E2=80=94there is nothing now but habituation to war which can give one=
 army
a decided superiority over another. The nearer we approach to a state of
equality in all these things, the more decisive becomes the relation in poi=
nt
of numbers.
</p>

<p>
The character of modern battles is the result of this state of equality. Ta=
ke
for instance the battle of Borodino, where the first army in the world, the
French, measured its strength with the Russian, which, in many parts of its
organisation, and in the education of its special branches, might be consid=
ered
the furthest behindhand. In the whole battle there is not one single trace =
of
superior art or intelligence, it is a mere trial of strength between the
respective armies throughout; and as they were nearly equal in that respect=
,
the result could not be otherwise than a gradual turn of the scale in favou=
r of
that side where there was the greatest energy on the part of the commander,=
 and
the most experience in war on the part of the troops. We have taken this ba=
ttle
as an illustration, because in it there was an equality in the numbers on e=
ach
side such as is rarely to be found.
</p>

<p>
We do not maintain that all battles exactly resemble this, but it shows the
dominant tone of most of them.
</p>

<p>
In a battle in which the forces try their strength on each other so leisure=
ly
and methodically, an excess of force on one side must make the result in it=
s
favour much more certain. And it is a fact that we may search modern milita=
ry
history in vain for a battle in which an army has beaten another double its=
 own
strength, an occurrence by no means uncommon in former times. Buonaparte, t=
he
greatest general of modern times, in all his great victorious
battles=E2=80=94with one exception, that of Dresden, 1813=E2=80=94had manag=
ed to
assemble an army superior in numbers, or at least very little inferior, to =
that
of his opponent, and when it was impossible for him to do so, as at Leipsic=
,
Brienne, Laon, and Belle-Alliance, he was beaten.
</p>

<p>
The absolute strength is in strategy generally a given quantity, which the
commander cannot alter. But from this it by no means follows that it is
impossible to carry on a war with a decidedly inferior force. War is not al=
ways
a voluntary act of state policy, and least of all is it so when the forces =
are
very unequal: consequently, any relation of forces is imaginable in war, an=
d it
would be a strange theory of war which would wish to give up its office jus=
t
where it is most wanted.
</p>

<p>
However desirable theory may consider a proportionate force, still it canno=
t
say that no use can be made of the most disproportionate. No limits can be
prescribed in this respect.
</p>

<p>
The weaker the force the more moderate must be the object it proposes to
itself, and the weaker the force the shorter time it will last. In these tw=
o
directions there is a field for weakness to give way, if we may use this
expression. Of the changes which the measure of the force produces in the
conduct of war, we can only speak by degrees, as these things present
themselves; at present it is sufficient to have indicated the general point=
 of
view, but to complete that we shall add one more observation.
</p>

<p>
The more that an army involved in an unequal combat falls short of the numb=
er
of its opponents, the greater must be the tension of its powers, the greate=
r
its energy when danger presses. If the reverse takes place, and instead of
heroic desperation a spirit of despondency ensues, then certainly there is =
an
end to every art of war.
</p>

<p>
If with this energy of powers is combined a wise moderation in the object
proposed, then there is that play of brilliant actions and prudent forbeara=
nce
which we admire in the wars of Frederick the Great.
</p>

<p>
But the less that this moderation and caution can effect, the more must the
tension and energy of the forces become predominant. When the disproportion=
 of
forces is so great that no modification of our own object can ensure us saf=
ety
from a catastrophe, or where the probable continuance of the danger is so g=
reat
that the greatest economy of our powers can no longer suffice to bring us t=
o
our object, then the tension of our powers should be concentrated for one
desperate blow; he who is pressed on all sides expecting little help from
things which promise none, will place his last and only reliance in the mor=
al
ascendancy which despair gives to courage, and look upon the greatest darin=
g as
the greatest wisdom,=E2=80=94at the same time employ the assistance of subt=
le
stratagem, and if he does not succeed, will find in an honourable downfall =
the
right to rise hereafter.

<h3><a name=3D"chap50"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>Relation of the Three Arms</h3>

<p>
We shall only speak of the three principal arms: Infantry, Cavalry, and
Artillery.
</p>

<p>
We must be excused for making the following analysis which belongs more to
tactics, but is necessary to give distinctness to our ideas.
</p>

<p>
The combat is of two kinds, which are essentially different: the destructiv=
e
principle of fire, and the hand to hand or personal combat. This latter, ag=
ain,
is either attack or defence. (As we here speak of elements, attack and defe=
nce
are to be understood in a perfectly absolute sense.) Artillery, obviously, =
acts
only with the destructive principle of fire. Cavalry only with personal com=
bat.
Infantry with both.
</p>

<p>
In close combat the essence of defence consists in standing firm, as if roo=
ted
to the ground; the essence of the attack is movement. Cavalry is entirely
deficient in the first quality; on the other hand, it possesses the latter =
in
an especial manner. It is therefore only suited for attack. Infantry has
especially the property of standing firm, but is not altogether without
mobility.
</p>

<p>
From this division of the elementary forces of war into different arms, we =
have
as a result, the superiority and general utility of Infantry as compared wi=
th
the other two arms, from its being the only arm which unites in itself all =
the
three elementary forces. A further deduction to be drawn is, that the
combination of the three arms leads to a more perfect use of the forces, by
affording the means of strengthening at pleasure either the one or the othe=
r of
the principles which are united in an unalterable manner in Infantry.
</p>

<p>
The destructive principle of fire is in the wars of the present time plainl=
y
beyond measure the most effective; nevertheless, the close combat, man to m=
an,
is just as plainly to be regarded as the real basis of combat. For that rea=
son,
therefore, an army of artillery only would be an absurdity in war, but an a=
rmy
of cavalry is conceivable, only it would possess very little intensity of f=
orce
An army of infantry alone is not only conceivable but also much the stronge=
st
of the three. The three arms, therefore, stand in this order in reference t=
o
independent value=E2=80=94Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery.
</p>

<p>
But this order does not hold good if applied to the relative importance of =
each
arm when they are all three acting in conjunction. As the destructive princ=
iple
is much more effective than the principle of motion, therefore the complete
want of cavalry would weaken an army less than the total want of artillery.
</p>

<p>
An army consisting of infantry and artillery alone, would certainly find it=
self
in a disagreeable position if opposed to an army composed of all three arms=
;
but if what it lacked in cavalry was compensated for by a proportionate
increase of infantry, it would still, by a somewhat different mode of actin=
g,
be able to do very well with its tactical economy. Its outpost service woul=
d
cause some embarrassment; it would never be able to pursue a beaten enemy w=
ith
great vivacity, and it must make a retreat with greater hardships and effor=
ts;
but these inconveniences would still never be sufficient in themselves to d=
rive
it completely out of the field.=E2=80=94On the other hand, such an army opp=
osed
to one composed of infantry and cavalry only would be able to play a very g=
ood
part, while it is hardly conceivable that the latter could keep the field a=
t
all against an army made up of all three arms.
</p>

<p>
Of course these reflections on the relative importance of each single arm
result only from a consideration of the generality of events in war, where =
one
case compensates another; and therefore it is not our intention to apply th=
e
truth thus ascertained to each individual case of a particular combat. A
battalion on outpost service or on a retreat may, perhaps, choose to have w=
ith
it a squadron in preference to a couple of guns. A body of cavalry with hor=
se
artillery, sent in rapid pursuit of, or to cut off, a flying enemy wants no
infantry, etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
If we summarise the results of these considerations they amount to this.
</p>

<p>
1. That infantry is the most independent of the three arms.
</p>

<p>
2. Artillery is quite wanting in independence.
</p>

<p>
3. Infantry is the most important in the combination of the three arms.
</p>

<p>
4. Cavalry can the most easily be dispensed with.
</p>

<p>
5. A combination of the three arms gives the greatest strength.
</p>

<p>
Now, if the combination of the three gives the greatest strength, it is nat=
ural
to inquire what is the best absolute proportion of each, but that is a ques=
tion
which it is almost impossible to answer.
</p>

<p>
If we could form a comparative estimate of the cost of organising in the fi=
rst
instance, and then provisioning and maintaining each of the three arms, and
then again of the relative amount of service rendered by each in war, we sh=
ould
obtain a definite result which would give the best proportion in the abstra=
ct.
But this is little more than a play of the imagination. The very first term=
 in
the comparison is difficult to determine, that is to say, one of the factor=
s,
the cost in money, is not difficult to find; but another, the value of
men=E2=80=99s lives, is a computation which no one would readily try to sol=
ve by
figures.
</p>

<p>
Also the circumstance that each of the three arms chiefly depends on a
different element of strength in the state=E2=80=94Infantry on the number o=
f the
male population, cavalry on the number of horses, artillery on available
financial means=E2=80=94introduces into the calculation some heterogeneous
conditions, the overruling influence of which may be plainly observed in th=
e
great outlines of the history of different people at various periods.
</p>

<p>
As, however, for other reasons we cannot altogether dispense with some stan=
dard
of comparison, therefore, in place of the whole of the first term of the
comparison we must take only that one of its factors which can be ascertain=
ed,
namely, the cost in money. Now on this point it is sufficient for our purpo=
se
to assume that, in general, a squadron of 150 horsemen, a battalion of infa=
ntry
800 strong, a battery of artillery consisting of 8 six-pounders, cost nearl=
y
the same, both as respects the expense of formation and of maintenance.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the other member of the comparison, that is, how much servic=
e
the one arm is capable of rendering as compared with the others, it is much
less easy to find any distinct quantity. The thing might perhaps be possibl=
e if
it depended merely on the destroying principle; but each arm is destined to=
 its
own particular use, therefore has its own particular sphere of action, whic=
h,
again, is not so distinctly defined that it might not be greater or less
through modifications only in the mode of conducting the war, without causi=
ng
any decided disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
We are often told of what experience teaches on this subject, and it is
supposed that military history affords the information necessary for a
settlement of the question, but every one must look upon all that as nothin=
g
more than a way of talking, which, as it is not derived from anything of a
primary and necessary nature, does not deserve attention in an analytical
examination.
</p>

<p>
Now although a fixed ratio as representing the best proportion between the
three arms is conceivable, but is an x which it is impossible to find, a me=
re
imaginary quantity, still it is possible to appreciate the effects of havin=
g a
great superiority or a great inferiority in one particular arm as compared =
with
the same arm in the enemy=E2=80=99s army.
</p>

<p>
Artillery increases the destructive principle of fire; it is the most
redoubtable of arms, and its want, therefore, diminishes very considerably =
the
intensive force of an army. On the other hand, it is the least moveable,
consequently, makes an army more unwieldy; further, it always requires a fo=
rce
for its support, because it is incapable of close combat; if it is too
numerous, so that the troops appointed for its protection are not able to
resist the attacks of the enemy at every point, it is often lost, and from =
that
follows a fresh disadvantage, because of the three arms it is the only one
which in its principal parts, that is guns and carriages, the enemy can soo=
n
use against us.
</p>

<p>
Cavalry increases the principle of mobility in an army. If too few in numbe=
r
the brisk flame of the elements of war is thereby weakened, because everyth=
ing
must be done slower (on foot), everything must be organised with more care;=
 the
rich harvest of victory, instead of being cut with a scythe, can only be re=
aped
with a sickle.
</p>

<p>
An excess of cavalry can certainly never be looked upon as a direct diminut=
ion
of the combatant force, as an organic disproportion, but it may certainly b=
e so
indirectly, on account of the difficulty of feeding that arm, and also if w=
e
reflect that instead of a surplus of 10,000 horsemen not required we might =
have
50,000 infantry.
</p>

<p>
These peculiarities arising from the preponderance of one arm are the more
important to the art of war in its limited sense, as that art teaches the u=
se
of whatever forces are forthcoming; and when forces are placed under the
command of a general, the proportion of the three arms is also commonly alr=
eady
settled without his having had much voice in the matter.
</p>

<p>
If we would form an idea of the character of warfare modified by the
preponderance of one or other of the three arms it is to be done in the
following manner:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
An excess of artillery leads to a more defensive and passive character in o=
ur
measures; our interest will be to seek security in strong positions, great
natural obstacles of ground, even in mountain positions, in order that the
natural impediments we find in the ground may undertake the defence and
protection of our numerous artillery, and that the enemy=E2=80=99s forces m=
ay
come themselves and seek their own destruction. The whole war will be carri=
ed
on in a serious formal minuet step.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a want of artillery will make us prefer the offensive, t=
he
active, the mobile principle; marching, fatigue, exertion, become our speci=
al
weapons, thus the war will become more diversified, more lively, rougher; s=
mall
change is substituted for great events.
</p>

<p>
With a very numerous cavalry we seek wide plains, and take to great movemen=
ts.
At a greater distance from the enemy we enjoy more rest and greater
conveniences without conferring the same advantages on our adversary. We ma=
y
venture on bolder measures to outflank him, and on more daring movements
generally, as we have command over space. In as far as diversions and invas=
ions
are true auxiliary means of war we shall be able to make use of them with
greater facility.
</p>

<p>
A decided want of cavalry diminishes the force of mobility in an army witho=
ut
increasing its destructive power as an excess of artillery does. Prudence a=
nd
method become then the leading characteristics of the war. Always to remain
near the enemy in order to keep him constantly in view=E2=80=94no rapid, st=
ill
less hurried movements, everywhere a slow pushing on of well concentrated
masses=E2=80=94a preference for the defensive and for broken country, and, =
when
the offensive must be resorted to, the shortest road direct to the centre o=
f
force in the enemy=E2=80=99s army=E2=80=94these are the natural tendencies =
or
principles in such cases.
</p>

<p>
These different forms which warfare takes according as one or other of the
three arms preponderates, seldom have an influence so complete and decided =
as
alone, or chiefly to determine the direction of a whole undertaking. Whethe=
r we
shall act strategically on the offensive or defensive, the choice of a thea=
tre
of war, the determination to fight a great battle, or adopt some other mean=
s of
destruction, are points which must be determined by other and more essentia=
l
considerations, at least, if this is not the case, it is much to be feared =
that
we have mistaken minor details for the chief consideration. But although th=
is
is so, although the great questions must be decided before on other grounds=
,
there still always remains a certain margin for the influence of the
preponderating arm, for in the offensive we can always be prudent and
methodical, in the defensive bold and enterprising, etc., etc., through all=
 the
different stages and gradations of the military life.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the nature of a war may have a notable influence on the
proportions of the three arms.
</p>

<p>
First, a national war, kept up by militia and a general levy (Landsturm), m=
ust
naturally bring into the field a very numerous infantry; for in such wars t=
here
is a greater want of the means of equipment than of men, and as the equipme=
nt
consequently is confined to what is indisputably necessary, we may easily
imagine, that for every battery of eight pieces, not only one, but two or t=
hree
battalions might be raised.
</p>

<p>
Second, if a weak state opposed to a powerful one cannot take refuge in a
general call of the male population to regular military service, or in a
militia system resembling it, then the increase of its artillery is certain=
ly
the shortest way of bringing up its weak army nearer to an equality with th=
at
of the enemy, for it saves men, and intensifies the essential principle of
military force, that is, the destructive principle. Any way, such a state w=
ill
mostly be confined to a limited theatre, and therefore this arm will be bet=
ter
suited to it. Frederick the Great adopted this means in the later period of=
 the
Seven Years=E2=80=99 War.
</p>

<p>
Third, cavalry is the arm for movement and great decisions; its increase be=
yond
the ordinary proportions is therefore important if the war extends over a g=
reat
space, if expeditions are to be made in various directions, and great and
decisive blows are intended. Buonaparte is an example of this.
</p>

<p>
That the offensive and defensive do not properly in themselves exercise an
influence on the proportion of cavalry will only appear plainly when we com=
e to
speak of these two methods of acting in war; in the meantime, we shall only
remark that both assailant and defender as a rule traverse the same spaces =
in
war, and may have also, at least in many cases, the same decisive intention=
s.
We remind our readers of the campaign of 1812.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly believed that, in the middle ages, cavalry was much more
numerous in proportion to infantry, and that the difference has been gradua=
lly
on the decrease ever since. Yet this is a mistake, at least partly. The
proportion of cavalry was, according to numbers, on the average perhaps, no=
t
much greater; of this we may convince ourselves by tracing, through the his=
tory
of the middle ages, the detailed statements of the armed forces then employ=
ed.
Let us only think of the masses of men on foot who composed the armies of t=
he
Crusaders, or the masses who followed the Emperors of Germany on their Roma=
n
expeditions. It was in reality the importance of the cavalry which was so m=
uch
greater in those days; it was the stronger arm, composed of the flower of t=
he
people, so much so that, although always very much weaker actually in numbe=
rs,
it was still always looked upon as the chief thing, infantry was little val=
ued,
hardly spoken of; hence has arisen the belief that its numbers were few. No
doubt it happened oftener than it does now, that in incursions of small
importance in France, Germany, and Italy, a small army was composed entirel=
y of
cavalry; as it was the chief arm, there is nothing inconsistent in that; bu=
t
these cases decide nothing if we take a general view, as they are greatly
outnumbered by cases of greater armies of the period constituted differentl=
y.
It was only when the obligations to military service imposed by the feudal =
laws
had ceased, and wars were carried on by soldiers enlisted, hired, and
paid=E2=80=94when, therefore, wars depended on money and enlistment, that i=
s, at
the time of the Thirty Years=E2=80=99 War, and the wars of Louis XIV.=E2=80=
=94that
this employment of great masses of almost useless infantry was checked, and
perhaps in those days they might have fallen into the exclusive use of cava=
lry,
if infantry had not just then risen in importance through the improvements =
in
fire-arms, by which means it maintained its numerical superiority in propor=
tion
to cavalry; at this period, if infantry was weak, the proportion was as one=
 to
one, if numerous as three to one.
</p>

<p>
Since then cavalry has always decreased in importance according as improvem=
ents
in the use of fire-arms have advanced. This is intelligible enough in itsel=
f,
but the improvement we speak of does not relate solely to the weapon itself=
 and
the skill in handling it; we advert also to greater ability in using troops
armed with this weapon. At the battle of Mollwitz the Prussian army had bro=
ught
the fire of their infantry to such a state of perfection, that there has be=
en
no improvement since then in that sense. On the other hand, the use of infa=
ntry
in broken ground and as skirmishers has been introduced more recently, and =
is
to be looked upon as a very great advance in the art of destruction.
</p>

<p>
Our opinion is, therefore, that the relation of cavalry has not much change=
d as
far as regards numbers, but as regards its importance, there has been a gre=
at
alteration. This seems to be a contradiction, but is not so in reality. The
infantry of the middle ages, although forming the greater proportion of an
army, did not attain to that proportion by its value as compared to cavalry=
,
but because all that could not be appointed to the very costly cavalry were
handed over to the infantry; this infantry was, therefore, merely a last
resource; and if the number of cavalry had depended merely on the value set=
 on
that arm, it could never have been too great. Thus we can understand how
cavalry, in spite of its constantly decreasing importance, may still, perha=
ps,
have importance enough to keep its numerical relation at that point which i=
t
has hitherto so constantly maintained.
</p>

<p>
It is a remarkable fact that, at least since the wars of the Austrian
succession, the proportion of cavalry to infantry has changed very little, =
the
variation being constantly between a fourth, a fifth or a sixth; this seems=
 to
indicate that those proportions meet the natural requirements of an army, a=
nd
that these numbers give the solution which it is impossible to find in a di=
rect
manner. We doubt, however, if this is the case, and we find the principal
instances of the employment of a numerous cavalry sufficiently accounted fo=
r by
other causes.
</p>

<p>
Austria and Russia are states which have kept up a numerous cavalry, becaus=
e
they retain in their political condition the fragments of a Tartar
organisation. Buonaparte for his purposes could never be strong enough in
cavalry; when he had made use of the conscription as far as possible, he ha=
d no
ways of strengthening his armies, but by increasing the auxiliary arms, as =
they
cost him more in money than in men. Besides this, it stands to reason that =
in
military enterprises of such enormous extent as his, cavalry must have a
greater value than in ordinary cases.
</p>

<p>
Frederick the Great it is well known reckoned carefully every recruit that
could be saved to his country; it was his great business to keep up the
strength of his army, as far as possible at the expense of other countries.=
 His
reasons for this are easy to conceive, if we remember that his small domini=
ons
did not then include Prussia and the Westphalian provinces. Cavalry was kep=
t
complete by recruitment more easily than infantry, irrespective of fewer me=
n
being required; in addition to which, his system of war was completely foun=
ded
on the mobility of his army, and thus it was, that while his infantry
diminished in number, his cavalry was always increasing itself till the end=
 of
the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War. Still at the end of that war it was hardly mo=
re
than a fourth of the number of infantry that he had in the field.
</p>

<p>
At the period referred to there is no want of instances, also of armies
entering the field unusually weak in cavalry, and yet carrying off the vict=
ory.
The most remarkable is the battle of Gross-gorschen. If we only count the
French divisions which took part in the battle, Buonaparte was 100,000 stro=
ng,
of which 5,000 were cavalry, 90,000 infantry; the Allies had 70,000, of whi=
ch
25,000 were cavalry and 40,000 infantry. Thus, in place of the 20,000 caval=
ry
on the side of the Allies in excess of the total of the French cavalry,
Buonaparte had only 50,000 additional infantry when he ought to have had
100,000. As he gained the battle with that superiority in infantry, we may =
ask
whether it was at all likely that he would have lost it if the proportions =
had
been 140,000 to 40,000.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the great advantage of our superiority in cavalry was shown
immediately after the battle, for Buonaparte gained hardly any trophies by =
his
victory. The gain of a battle is therefore not everything,=E2=80=94but is i=
t not
always the chief thing?
</p>

<p>
If we put together these considerations, we can hardly believe that the
numerical proportion between cavalry and infantry which has existed for the
last eighty years is the natural one, founded solely on their absolute valu=
e;
we are much rather inclined to think, that after many fluctuations, the
relative proportions of these arms will change further in the same directio=
n as
hitherto, and that the fixed number of cavalry at last will be considerably
less.
</p>

<p>
With respect to artillery, the number of guns has naturally increased since=
 its
first invention, and according as it has been made lighter and otherwise
improved; still since the time of Frederick the Great, it has also kept ver=
y
much to the same proportion of two or three guns per 1,000 men, we mean at =
the
commencement of a campaign; for during its course artillery does not melt a=
way
as fast as infantry, therefore at the end of a campaign the proportion is
generally notably greater, perhaps three, four, or five guns per 1,000 men.
Whether this is the natural proportion, or that the increase of artillery m=
ay
be carried still further, without prejudice to the whole conduct of war, mu=
st
be left for experience to decide.
</p>

<p>
The principal results we obtain from the whole of these considerations,
are=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. That infantry is the chief arm, to which the other two are subordinate.
</p>

<p>
2. That by the exercise of great skill and energy in command, the want of t=
he
two subordinate arms may in some measure be compensated for, provided that =
we
are much stronger in infantry; and the better the infantry the easier this =
may
be done.
</p>

<p>
3. That it is more difficult to dispense with artillery than with cavalry,
because it is the chief principle of destruction, and its mode of fighting =
is
more amalgamated with that of infantry.
</p>

<p>
4. That artillery being the strongest arm, as regards destructive action, a=
nd
cavalry the weakest in that respect, the question must in general arise, ho=
w
much artillery can we have without inconvenience, and what is the least
proportion of cavalry we require?

<h3><a name=3D"chap51"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Order of Battle of an Army</h3>

<p>
The order of battle is that division and formation of the different arms in=
to
separate parts or sections of the whole Army, and that form of general posi=
tion
or disposition of those parts which is to be the norm throughout the whole
campaign or war.
</p>

<p>
It consists, therefore, in a certain measure, of an arithmetical and a
geometrical element, <i>the division</i> and the <i>form of disposition</i>=
.
The first proceeds from the permanent peace organisation of the army; adopt=
s as
units certain parts, such as battalions, squadrons, and batteries, and with
them forms units of a higher order up to the highest of all, the whole army=
,
according to the requirements of predominating circumstances. In like manne=
r,
the form of disposition comes from the elementary tactics, in which the arm=
y is
instructed and exercised in time of peace, which must be looked upon as a
property in the troops that cannot be essentially modified at the moment wa=
r
breaks out, the disposition connects these tactics with the conditions whic=
h
the use of the troops in war and in large masses demands, and thus it settl=
es
in a general way the rule or norm in conformity with which the troops are t=
o be
drawn up for battle.
</p>

<p>
This has been invariably the case when great armies have taken the field, a=
nd
there have been times when this form was considered as the most essential p=
art
of the battle.
</p>

<p>
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the improvements in the
firearms of infantry occasioned a great increase of that arm, and allowed o=
f
its being deployed in such long thin lines, the order of battle was thereby
simplified, but, at the same time it became more difficult and more artific=
ial
in the carrying out, and as no other way of disposing of cavalry at the
commencement of a battle was known but that of posting them on the wings, w=
here
they were out of the fire and had room to move, therefore in the order of
battle the army always became a closed inseparable whole. If such an army w=
as
divided in the middle, it was like an earthworm cut in two: the wings had s=
till
life and the power of motion, but they had lost their natural functions. Th=
e
army lay, therefore, in a manner under a spell of unity, and whenever any p=
arts
of it had to be placed in a separate position, a small organisation and
disorganisation became necessary. The marches which the whole army had to m=
ake
were a condition in which, to a certain extent, it found itself out of rule=
. If
the enemy was at hand, the march had to be arranged in the most artificial
manner, and in order that one line or one wing might be always at the
prescribed distance from the other, the troops had to scramble over everyth=
ing:
marches had also constantly to be stolen from the enemy, and this perpetual
theft only escaped severe punishment through one circumstance, which was, t=
hat
the enemy lay under the same ban.
</p>

<p>
Hence, when, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, it was discovere=
d
that cavalry would serve just as well to protect a wing if it stood in rear=
 of
the army as if it were placed on the prolongation of the line, and that,
besides this, it might be applied to other purposes than merely fighting a =
duel
with the enemy=E2=80=99s cavalry, a great step in advance was made, because=
 now
the army in its principal extension or front, which is always the breadth o=
f
its order of battle (position), consisted entirely of homogeneous members, =
so
that it could be formed of any number of parts at pleasure, each part like
another and like the whole. In this way it ceased to be one single piece an=
d
became an articulated whole, consequently pliable and manageable: the parts
might be separated from the whole and then joined on again without difficul=
ty,
the order of battle always remained the same.=E2=80=94Thus arose the corps
consisting of all arms, that is, thus such an organisation became possible,=
 for
the want of it had been felt long before.
</p>

<p>
That all this relates to the combat is very natural. The battle was formerl=
y
the whole war, and will always continue to be the principal part of it; but=
,
the order of battle belongs generally more to tactics than strategy, and it=
 is
only introduced here to show how tactics in organising the whole into small=
er
wholes made preparations for strategy.
</p>

<p>
The greater armies become, the more they are distributed over wide spaces a=
nd
the more diversified the action and reaction of the different parts amongst
themselves, the wider becomes the field of strategy, and, therefore, then t=
he
order of battle, in the sense of our definition, must also come into a kind=
 of
reciprocal action with strategy, which manifests itself chiefly at the extr=
eme
points where tactics and strategy meet, that is, at those moments when the
general distribution of the combatant forces passes into the special
dispositions for the combat.
</p>

<p>
We now turn to those three points, the <i>division, combination of arms</i>=
,
and <i>order of battle</i> (<i>disposition</i>) in a strategic point of vie=
w.
</p>

<h4>
1.=E2=80=94Division.
</h4>

<p>
In strategy we must never ask what is to be the strength of a division or a
corps, but how many corps or division an army should have. There is nothing
more unmanageable than an army divided into three parts, except it be one
divided into only two, in which case the chief command must be almost
neutralised.
</p>

<p>
To fix the strength of great and small corps, either on the grounds of
elementary tactics or on higher grounds, leaves an incredibly wide field fo=
r
arbitrary judgment, and heaven knows what strange modes of reasoning have
sported in this wide field. On the other hand, the necessity of forming an
independent whole (army) into a certain number of parts is a thing as obvio=
us
as it is positive, and this idea furnishes real strategic motives for
determining the number of the greater divisions of an army, consequently th=
eir
strength, whilst the strength of the smaller divisions, such as companies,
battalions, etc., is left to be determined by tactics.
</p>

<p>
We can hardly imagine the smallest independent body in which there are not =
at
least three parts to be distinguished, that one part may be thrown out in
advance, and another part be left in rear: that four is still more convenie=
nt
follows of itself, if we keep in view that the middle part, being the princ=
ipal
division, ought to be stronger than either of the others; in this way, we m=
ay
proceed to make out eight, which appears to us to be the most suitable numb=
er
for an army if we take one part for an advanced guard as a constant necessi=
ty,
three for the main body, that is a right wing, centre and left wing, two
divisions for reserve, and one to detach to the right, one to the left. Wit=
hout
pedantically ascribing a great importance to these numbers and figures, we
certainly believe that they represent the most usual and frequently recurri=
ng
strategic disposition, and on that account one that is convenient.
</p>

<p>
Certainly it seems that the supreme direction of an army (and the direction=
 of
every whole) must be greatly facilitated if there are only three or four
subordinates to command, but the commander-in-chief must pay dearly for thi=
s
convenience in a twofold manner. In the first place, an order loses in
rapidity, force, and exactness if the gradation ladder down which it has to
descend is long, and this must be the case if there are corps-commanders
between the division leaders and the chief; secondly, the chief loses gener=
ally
in his own proper power and efficiency the wider the spheres of action of h=
is
immediate subordinates become. A general commanding 100,000 men in eight
divisions exercises a power which is greater in intensity than if the 100,0=
00
men were divided into only three corps. There are many reasons for this, bu=
t
the most important is that each commander looks upon himself as having a ki=
nd
of proprietary right in his own corps, and always opposes the withdrawal fr=
om
him of any portion of it for a longer or shorter time. A little experience =
of
war will make this evident to any one.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand the number of divisions must not be too great, otherw=
ise
disorder will ensue. It is difficult enough to manage eight divisions from =
one
head quarter, and the number should never be allowed to exceed ten. But in =
a
division in which the means of circulating orders are much less, the smalle=
r
normal number four, or at most five, may be regarded as the more suitable.
</p>

<p>
If these factors, five and ten, will not answer, that is, if the brigades a=
re
too strong, then <i>corps d=E2=80=99arm=C3=A9e</i> must be introduced; but =
we must
remember that by so doing, a new power is created, which at once very much
lowers all other factors.
</p>

<p>
But now, what is too strong a brigade? The custom is to make them from 2,00=
0 to
5,000 men strong, and there appear to be two reasons for making the latter
number the limit; the first is that a brigade is supposed to be a subdivisi=
on
which can be commanded by one man directly, that is, through the compass of=
 his
voice: the second is that any larger body of infantry should not be left
without artillery, and through this first combination of arms a special
division of itself is formed.
</p>

<p>
We do not wish to involve ourselves in these tactical subtilties, neither s=
hall
we enter upon the disputed point, where and in what proportions the combina=
tion
of all three arms should take place, whether with divisions of 8,000 to 12,=
000
men, or with corps which are 20,000 to 30,000 men strong. The most decided
opponent of these combinations will scarcely take exception at the mere
assertion, that nothing but this combination of the three arms can make a
division independent, and that therefore, for such as are intended to be
frequently detached separately, it is at least very desirable.
</p>

<p>
An army of 200,000 men in ten divisions, the divisions composed of five
brigades each, would give brigades 4,000 strong. We see here no disproporti=
on.
Certainly this army might also be divided into five corps, the corps into f=
our
divisions, and the division into four brigades, which makes the brigade 2,5=
00
men strong; but the first distribution, looked at in the abstract, appears =
to
us preferable, for besides that, in the other, there is one more gradation =
of
rank, five parts are too few to make an army manageable; four divisions, in
like manner, are too few for a corps, and 2,500 men is a weak brigade, of
which, in this manner, there are eighty, whereas the first formation has on=
ly
fifty, and is therefore simpler. All these advantages are given up merely f=
or
the sake of having only to send orders to half as many generals. Of course =
the
distribution into corps is still more unsuitable for smaller armies.
</p>

<p>
This is the abstract view of the case. The particular case may present good
reasons for deciding otherwise. Likewise, we must admit that, although eigh=
t or
ten divisions may be directed when united in a level country, in widely
extended mountain positions the thing might perhaps be impossible. A great
river which divides an army into halves, makes a commander for each half
indispensable; in short, there are a hundred local and particular objects o=
f
the most decisive character, before which all rules must give way.
</p>

<p>
But still, experience teaches us, that these abstract grounds come most
frequently into use and are seldomer overruled by others than we should per=
haps
suppose.
</p>

<p>
We wish further to explain clearly the scope of the foregoing consideration=
s by
a simple outline, for which purpose we now place the different points of mo=
st
importance next to each other.
</p>

<p>
As we mean by the term numbers, or parts of a whole, only those which are m=
ade
by the primary, therefore the immediate division, we say.
</p>

<p>
1. If a whole has too few members it is unwieldy.
</p>

<p>
2. If the parts of a whole body are too large, the power of the superior wi=
ll
is thereby weakened.
</p>

<p>
3. With every additional step through which an order has to pass, it is
weakened in two ways: in one way by the loss of force, which it suffers in =
its
passage through an additional step; in another way by the longer time in it=
s
transmission.
</p>

<p>
The tendency of all this is to show that the number of co-ordinate division=
s
should be as great, and the gradational steps as few as possible; and the o=
nly
limitation to this conclusion is, that in armies no more than from eight to
ten, and in subordinate corps no more than from four or at most six,
subdivisions can be conveniently directed.
</p>

<h4>
2.=E2=80=94Combination of Arms.
</h4>

<p>
For strategy the combination of the three arms in the order of battle is on=
ly
important in regard to those parts of the army which, according to the usua=
l
order of things, are likely to be frequently employed in a detached positio=
n,
where they may be obliged to engage in an independent combat. Now it is in =
the
nature of things, that the members of the first class, and for the most par=
t
only these, are destined for detached positions, because, as we shall see
elsewhere, detached positions are most generally adopted upon the suppositi=
on
and the necessity of a body independent in itself.
</p>

<p>
In a strict sense strategy would therefore only require a permanent combina=
tion
of arms in army corps, or where these do not exist, in divisions, leaving i=
t to
circumstances to determine when a provisional combination of the three arms
shall be made in subdivisions of an inferior order.
</p>

<p>
But it is easy to see that, when corps are of considerable size, such as 30=
,000
or 40,000 men, they can seldom find themselves in a situation to take up a
completely connected position in mass. With corps of such strength, a
combination of the arms in the divisions is therefore necessary. No one who=
 has
had any experience in war, will treat lightly the delay which occurs when
pressing messages have to be sent to some other perhaps distant point befor=
e
cavalry can be brought to the support of infantry=E2=80=94to say nothing of=
 the
confusion which takes place.
</p>

<p>
The details of the combination of the three arms, how far it should extend,=
 how
low down it should be carried, what proportions should be observed, the
strength of the reserves of each to be set apart=E2=80=94these are all pure=
ly
tactical considerations.
</p>

<h4>
3.=E2=80=94The Disposition.
</h4>

<p>
The determination as to the relations in space, according to which the part=
s of
an army amongst themselves are to be drawn up in order of battle, is likewi=
se
completely a tactical subject, referring solely to the battle. No doubt the=
re
is also a strategic disposition of the parts; but it depends almost entirel=
y on
determinations and requirements of the moment, and what there is in it of t=
he
rational, does not come within the meaning of the term =E2=80=9Corder of
battle.=E2=80=9D We shall therefore treat of it in the following chapter un=
der
the head of <i>Disposition of an Army</i>.
</p>

<p>
The order of battle of an army is therefore the organisation and dispositio=
n of
it in mass ready prepared for battle. Its parts are united in such a manner
that both the tactical and strategical requirements of the moment can be ea=
sily
satisfied by the employment of single parts drawn from the general mass. Wh=
en
such momentary exigency has passed over, these parts resume their original
place, and thus the order of battle becomes the first step to, and principa=
l
foundation of, that wholesome methodicism which, like the beat of a pendulu=
m,
regulates the work in war, and of which we have already spoken in the fourt=
h
chapter of the Second Book.
</p>

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap52"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>General Disposition of an Army</h=
3>

<p>
Between the moment of the first assembling of military forces, and that of =
the
solution arrived at maturity when strategy has brought the army to the deci=
sive
point, and each particular part has had its position and r=C3=B4le pointed =
out by
tactics, there is in most cases a long interval; it is the same between one
decisive catastrophe and another.
</p>

<p>
Formerly these intervals in a certain measure did not belong to war at all.
Take for example the manner in which Luxemburg encamped and marched. We sin=
gle
out this general because he is celebrated for his camps and marches, and
therefore may be considered a representative general of his period, and fro=
m
the <i>Histoire de la Flandre militaire</i>, we know more about him than ab=
out
other generals of the time.
</p>

<p>
The camp was regularly pitched with its rear close to a river, or morass, o=
r a
deep valley, which in the present day would be considered madness. The
direction in which the enemy lay had so little to do with determining the f=
ront
of the army, that cases are very common in which the rear was towards the e=
nemy
and the front towards their own country. This now unheard of mode of procee=
ding
is perfectly unintelligible, unless we suppose that in the choice of camps =
the
convenience of the troops was the chief, indeed almost the only considerati=
on,
and therefore look upon the state of being in camp as a state outside of th=
e
action of war, a kind of withdrawal behind the scenes, where one is quite a=
t
ease. The practice of always resting the rear upon some obstacle may be
reckoned the only measure of security which was then taken, of course, in t=
he
sense of the mode of conducting war in that day, for such a measure was qui=
te
inconsistent with the possibility of being compelled to fight in that posit=
ion.
But there was little reason for apprehension on that score, because the bat=
tles
generally depended on a kind of mutual understanding, like a duel, in which=
 the
parties repair to a convenient rendezvous. As armies, partly on account of
their numerous cavalry, which in the decline of its splendour was still
regarded, particularly by the French, as the principal arm, partly on accou=
nt
of the unwieldy organisation of their order of battle, could not fight in e=
very
description of country, an army in a close broken country was as it were un=
der
the protection of a neutral territory, and as it could itself make but litt=
le
use of broken ground, therefore, it was deemed preferable to go to meet an
enemy seeking battle. We know, indeed, that Luxemburg=E2=80=99s battles at
Fleurus, Stienkirk, and Neerwinden, were conceived in a different spirit; b=
ut
this spirit had only just then under this great general freed itself from t=
he
old method, and it had not yet reacted on the method of encampment. Alterat=
ions
in the art of war originate always in matters of a decisive nature, and the=
n
lead by degrees to modifications in other things. The expression <i>il va =
=C3=A0 la
guerre</i>, used in reference to a partizan setting out to watch the enemy,
shows how little the state of an army in camp was considered to be a state =
of
real warfare.
</p>

<p>
It was not much otherwise with the marches, for the artillery then separate=
d
itself completely from the rest of the army, in order to take advantage of
better and more secure roads, and the cavalry on the wings generally took t=
he
right alternately, that each might have in turn its share of the honour of
marching on the right.
</p>

<p>
At present (that is, chiefly since the Silesian wars) the situation out of
battle is so thoroughly influenced by its connection with battle that the t=
wo
states are in intimate correlation, and the one can no longer be completely
imagined without the other. Formerly in a campaign the battle was the real
weapon, the situation at other times only the handle=E2=80=94the former the=
 steel
blade, the other the wooden haft glued to it, the whole therefore composed =
of
heterogeneous parts,=E2=80=94now the battle is the edge, the situation out =
of the
battle the back of the blade, the whole to be looked upon as metal complete=
ly
welded together, in which it is impossible any longer to distinguish where =
the
steel ends and the iron begins.
</p>

<p>
This state in war outside of the battle is now partly regulated by the
organisation and regulations with which the army comes prepared from a stat=
e of
peace, partly by the tactical and strategic arrangements of the moment. The
three situations in which an army may be placed are in quarters, on a march=
, or
in camp. All three belong as much to tactics as to strategy, and these two
branches, bordering on each other here in many ways, often seem to, or actu=
ally
do, incorporate themselves with each other, so that many dispositions may b=
e
looked upon at the same time as both tactical and strategic.
</p>

<p>
We shall treat of these three situations of an army outside of the combat i=
n a
general way, before any special objects come into connection with them; but=
 we
must, first of all, consider the general disposition of the forces, because
that is a superior and more comprehensive measure, determining as respects
camps, cantonments, and marches.
</p>

<p>
If we look at the disposition of the forces in a general way, that is, leav=
ing
out of sight any special object, we can only imagine it as a unit, that is,=
 as
a whole, intended to fight all together, for any deviation from this simple=
st
form would imply a special object. Thus arises, therefore, the conception o=
f an
army, let it be small or large.
</p>

<p>
Further, when there is an absence of any special end, there only remains as=
 the
sole object the preservation of the army itself, which of course includes i=
ts
security. That the army shall be able to exist without inconvenience, and t=
hat
it shall be able to concentrate without difficulty for the purpose of fight=
ing,
are, therefore, the two requisite conditions. From these result, as desirab=
le,
the following points more immediately applying to subjects concerning the
existence and security of the army.
</p>

<p>
1. Facility of subsistence.
</p>

<p>
2. Facility of providing shelter for the troops.
</p>

<p>
3. Security of the rear.
</p>

<p>
4. An open country in front.
</p>

<p>
5. The position itself in a broken country.
</p>

<p>
6. Strategic points d=E2=80=99appui.
</p>

<p>
7. A suitable distribution of the troops.
</p>

<p>
Our elucidation of these several points is as follows:
</p>

<p>
The first two lead us to seek out cultivated districts, and great towns and
roads. They determine measures in general rather than in particular.
</p>

<p>
In the chapter on lines of communication will be found what we mean by secu=
rity
of the rear. The first and most important point in this respect is that the
centre of the position should be at a right angle with the principal line o=
f
retreat adjoining the position.
</p>

<p>
Respecting the fourth point, an army certainly cannot look over an expanse =
of
country in its front as it overlooks the space directly before it when in a
tactical position for battle. But the strategic eyes are the advanced guard=
,
scouts and patrols sent forward, spies, etc., etc., and the service will
naturally be easier for these in an open than in an intersected country. Th=
e
fifth point is merely the reverse of the fourth.
</p>

<p>
Strategical points d=E2=80=99appui differ from tactical in these two respec=
ts,
that the army need not be in immediate contact with them, and that, on the
other hand, they must be of greater extent. The cause of this is that,
according to the nature of the thing, the relations to time and space in wh=
ich
strategy moves are generally on a greater scale than those of tactics. If,
therefore, an army posts itself at a distance of a mile from the sea coast =
or
the banks of a great river, it leans strategically on these obstacles, for =
the
enemy cannot make use of such a space as this to effect a strategic turning
movement. Within its narrow limits he cannot adventure on marches miles in
length, occupying days and weeks. On the other hand, in strategy, a lake of
several miles in circumference is hardly to be looked upon as an obstacle; =
in
its proceedings, a few miles to the right or left are not of much consequen=
ce.
Fortresses will become strategic points d=E2=80=99appui, according as they =
are
large, and afford a wide sphere of action for offensive combinations.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of the army in separate masses may be done with a view eith=
er
to special objects and requirements, or to those of a general nature; here =
we
can only speak of the latter.
</p>

<p>
The first general necessity is to push forward the advanced guard and the o=
ther
troops required to watch the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The second is that, with very large armies, the reserves are usually placed
several miles in rear, and consequently occupy a separate position.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the covering of both wings of an army usually requires a separate
disposition of particular corps.
</p>

<p>
By this covering it is not at all meant that a portion of the army is to be
detached to defend the space round its wings, in order to prevent the enemy
from approaching these weak points, as they are called: who would then defe=
nd
the wings of these flanking corps? This kind of idea, which is so common, i=
s
complete nonsense. The wings of an army are in themselves not weak points o=
f an
army for this reason, that the enemy also has wings, and cannot menace ours
without placing his own in jeopardy. It is only if circumstances are unequa=
l,
if the enemy=E2=80=99s army is larger than ours, if his lines of communicat=
ion
are more secure (see Lines of Communication), it is only then that the wing=
s
become weak parts; but of these special cases we are not now speaking,
therefore, neither of a case in which a flanking corps is appointed in
connection with other combinations to defend effectually the space on our
wings, for that no longer belongs to the category of general dispositions.
</p>

<p>
But although the wings are not particularly weak parts still they are
particularly important, because here, on account of flanking movements the
defence is not so simple as in front, measures are more complicated and req=
uire
more time and preparation. For this reason it is necessary in the majority =
of
cases to protect the wings specially against unforeseen enterprises on the =
part
of the enemy, and this is done by placing stronger masses on the wings than
would be required for mere purposes of observation. To press heavily these
masses, even if they oppose no very serious resistance, more time is requir=
ed,
and the stronger they are the more the enemy must develop his forces and hi=
s
intentions, and by that means the object of the measure is attained; what i=
s to
be done further depends on the particular plans of the moment. We may there=
fore
regard corps placed on the wings as lateral advanced guards, intended to re=
tard
the advance of the enemy through the space beyond our wings and give us tim=
e to
make dispositions to counteract his movement.
</p>

<p>
If these corps are to fall back on the main body and the latter is not to m=
ake
a backward movement at the same time, then it follows of itself that they m=
ust
not be in the same line with the front of the main body, but thrown out
somewhat forwards, because when a retreat is to be made, even without being
preceded by a serious engagement, they should not retreat directly on the s=
ide
of the position.
</p>

<p>
From these reasons of a subjective nature, as they relate to the inner
organisation of an army, there arises a natural system of disposition, comp=
osed
of four or five parts according as the reserve remains with the main body o=
r
not.
</p>

<p>
As the subsistence and shelter of the troops partly decide the choice of a
position in general, so also they contribute to a disposition in separate
divisions. The attention which they demand comes into consideration along w=
ith
the other considerations above mentioned; and we seek to satisfy the one
without prejudice to the other. In most cases, by the division of an army i=
nto
five separate corps, the difficulties of subsistence and quartering will be
overcome, and no great alteration will afterwards be required on their acco=
unt.
</p>

<p>
We have still to cast a glance at the distances at which these separated co=
rps
may be allowed to be placed, if we are to retain in view the advantage of
mutual support, and, therefore, of concentrating for battle. On this subjec=
t we
remind our readers of what is said in the chapters on the duration and deci=
sion
of the combat, according to which no absolute distance, but only the most
general, as it were, average rules can be given, because absolute and relat=
ive
strength of arms and country have a great influence.
</p>

<p>
The distance of the advanced guard is the easiest to fix, as in retreating =
it
falls back on the main body of the army, and, therefore, may be at all even=
ts
at a distance of a long day=E2=80=99s march without incurring the risk of b=
eing
obliged to fight an independent battle. But it should not be sent further i=
n
advance than the security of the army requires, because the further it has =
to
fall back the more it suffers.
</p>

<p>
Respecting corps on the flanks, as we have already said, the combat of an
ordinary division of 8000 to 10,000 men usually lasts for several hours, ev=
en
for half a day before it is decided; on that account, therefore, there need=
 be
no hesitation in placing such a division at a distance of some leagues or o=
ne
or two miles, and for the same reason, corps of three or four divisions may=
 be
detached a day=E2=80=99s march or a distance of three or four miles.
</p>

<p>
From this natural and general disposition of the main body, in four or five
divisions at particular distances, a certain method has arisen of dividing =
an
army in a mechanical manner whenever there are no strong special reasons
against this ordinary method.
</p>

<p>
But although we assume that each of these distinct parts of an army shall b=
e
competent to undertake an independent combat, and it may be obliged to enga=
ge
in one, it does not therefore by any means follow that the real object of
fractioning an army is that the parts should fight separately; the necessit=
y
for this distribution of the army is mostly only a condition of existence
imposed by time. If the enemy approaches our position to try the fate of a
general action, the strategic period is over, everything concentrates itsel=
f
into the one moment of the battle, and therewith terminates and vanishes th=
e
object of the distribution of the army. As soon as the battle commences,
considerations about quarters and subsistence are suspended; the observatio=
n of
the enemy before our front and on our flanks has fulfilled the purpose of
checking his advance by a partial resistance, and now all resolves itself i=
nto
the one great unit=E2=80=94the great battle. The best criterion of skill in=
 the
disposition of an army lies in the proof that the distribution has been
considered merely as a condition, as a necessary evil, but that united acti=
on
in battle has been considered the object of the disposition.

<p>
These two bodies belong to that class of subjects into which both the tacti=
cal
and strategic threads run simultaneously. On the one hand we must reckon th=
em
amongst those provisions which give form to the battle and ensure the execu=
tion
of tactical plans; on the other hand, they frequently lead to independent
combats, and on account of their position, more or less distant from the ma=
in
body, they are to be regarded as links in the strategic chain, and it is th=
is
very feature which obliges us to supplement the preceding chapter by devoti=
ng a
few moments to their consideration.
</p>

<p>
Every body of troops, when not completely in readiness for battle, requires=
 an
advanced guard to learn the approach of the enemy, and to gain further
particulars respecting his force before he comes in sight, for the range of
vision, as a rule, does not go much beyond the range of firearms. But what =
sort
of man would he be who could not see farther than his arms can reach! The
foreposts are the eyes of the army, as we have already said. The want of th=
em,
however, is not always equally great; it has its degrees. The strength of
armies and the extent of ground they cover, time, place, contingencies, the
method of making war, even chance, are all points which have an influence i=
n
the matter; and, therefore, we cannot wonder that military history, instead=
 of
furnishing any definite and simple outlines of the method of using advanced
guards and outposts, only presents the subject in a kind of chaos of exampl=
es
of the most diversified nature.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we see the security of an army intrusted to a corps regularly
appointed to the duty of advanced guard; at another time a long line of
separate outposts; sometimes both these arrangements co-exist, sometimes
neither one nor the other; at one time there is only one advanced guard in
common for the whole of the advancing columns; at another time, each column=
 has
its own advanced guard. We shall endeavour to get a clear idea of what the
subject really is, and then see whether we can arrive at some principles
capable of application.
</p>

<p>
If the troops are on the march, a detachment of more or less strength forms=
 its
van or advanced guard, and in case of the movement of the army being revers=
ed,
this same detachment will form the rearguard. If the troops are in cantonme=
nts
or camp, an extended line of weak posts, forms the vanguard, <i>the
outposts</i>. It is essentially in the nature of things, that, when the arm=
y is
halted, a greater extent of space can and must be watched than when the arm=
y is
in motion, and therefore in the one case the conception of a chain of posts=
, in
the other that of a concentrated corps arises of itself.
</p>

<p>
The actual strength of an advanced guard, as well as of outposts, ranges fr=
om a
considerable corps, composed of an organisation of all three arms, to a
regiment of hussars, and from a strongly entrenched defensive line, occupie=
d by
portions of troops from each arm of the service, to mere outlying pickets, =
and
their supports detached from the camp. The services assigned to such vangua=
rds
range also from those of mere observation to an offer of opposition or
resistance to the enemy, and this opposition may not only be to give the ma=
in
body of the army the time which it requires to prepare for battle, but also=
 to
make the enemy develop his plans, and intentions, which consequently makes =
the
observation far more important.
</p>

<p>
According as more or less time is required to be gained, according as the
opposition to be offered is calculated upon and intended to meet the specia=
l
measures of the enemy, so accordingly must the strength of the advanced gua=
rd
and outposts be proportioned.
</p>

<p>
Frederick the Great, a general above all others ever ready for battle, and =
who
almost directed his army in battle by word of command, never required stron=
g
outposts. We see him therefore constantly encamping close under the eyes of=
 the
enemy, without any great apparatus of outposts, relying for his security, a=
t
one place on a hussar regiment, at another on a light battalion, or perhaps=
 on
the pickets, and supports furnished from the camp. On the march, a few thou=
sand
horse, generally furnished by the cavalry on the flanks of the first line,
formed his advanced guard, and at the end of the march rejoined the main bo=
dy.
He very seldom had any corps permanently employed as advanced guard.
</p>

<p>
When it is the intention of a small army, by using the whole weight of its =
mass
with great vigour and activity, to make the enemy feel the effect of its
superior discipline and the greater resolution of its commander, then almos=
t
every thing must be done <i>sous la barbe de l=E2=80=99ennemi</i>, in the s=
ame
way as Frederick the Great did when opposed to Daun. A system of holding ba=
ck
from the enemy, and a very formal, and extensive system of outposts would
neutralise all the advantages of the above kind of superiority. The
circumstance that an error of another kind, and the carrying out
Frederick=E2=80=99s system too far, may lead to a battle of Hochkirch, is n=
o
argument against this method of acting; we should rather say, that as there=
 was
only one battle of Hochkirch in all the Silesian war, we ought to recognise=
 in
this system a proof of the King=E2=80=99s consummate ability.
</p>

<p>
Napoleon, however, who commanded an army not deficient in discipline and
firmness, and who did not want for resolution himself, never moved without =
a
strong advanced guard. There are two reasons for this.
</p>

<p>
The first is to be found in the alteration in tactics. A whole army is no
longer led into battle as one body by mere word of command, to settle the
affair like a great duel by more or less skill and bravery; the combatants =
on
each side now range their forces more to suit the peculiarities of the grou=
nd
and circumstances, so that the order of battle, and consequently the battle
itself, is a whole made up of many parts, from which there follows, that th=
e
simple determination to fight becomes a regularly formed plan, and the word=
 of
command a more or less long preparatory arrangement. For this time and data=
 are
required.
</p>

<p>
The second cause lies in the great size of modern armies. Frederick brought
thirty or forty thousand men into battle; Napoleon from one to two hundred
thousand.
</p>

<p>
We have selected these examples because every one will admit, that two such
generals would never have adopted any systematic mode of proceeding without
some good reason. Upon the whole, there has been a general improvement in t=
he
use of advanced guards and outposts in modern wars; not that every one acte=
d as
Frederick, even in the Silesian wars, for at that time the Austrians had a
system of strong outposts, and frequently sent forward a corps as advanced
guard, for which they had sufficient reason from the situation in which the=
y
were placed. Just in the same way we find differences enough in the mode of
carrying on war in more modern times. Even the French Marshals Macdonald in
Silesia, Oudinot and Ney in the Mark (Brandenburg), advanced with armies of
sixty or seventy thousand men, without our reading of their having had any
advanced guard.=E2=80=94We have hitherto been discussing advanced guards an=
d
outposts in relation to their numerical strength; but there is another
difference which we must settle. It is that, when an army advances or retir=
es
on a certain breadth of ground, it may have a van and rear guard in common =
for
all the columns which are marching side by side, or each column may have on=
e
for itself. In order to form a clear idea on this subject, we must look at =
it
in this way.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental conception of an advanced guard, when a corps is so special=
ly
designated, is that its mission is the security of the main body or centre =
of
the army. If this main body is marching upon several contiguous roads so cl=
ose
together that they can also easily serve for the advanced guard, and theref=
ore
be covered by it, then the flank columns naturally require no special cover=
ing.
</p>

<p>
But those corps which are moving at great distances, in reality as detached
corps, must provide their own van-guards. The same applies also to any of t=
hose
corps which belong to the central mass, and owing to the direction that the
roads may happen to take, are too far from the centre column. Therefore the=
re
will be as many advanced guards, as there are columns virtually separated f=
rom
each other; if each of these advanced guards is much weaker than one genera=
l
one would be, then they fall more into the class of other tactical
dispositions, and there is no advanced guard in the strategic tableau. But =
if
the main body or centre has a much larger corps for its advanced guard, the=
n
that corps will appear as the advanced guard of the whole, and will be so i=
n
many respects.
</p>

<p>
But what can be the reason for giving the centre a van-guard so much strong=
er
than the wings? The following three reasons.
</p>

<p>
1. Because the mass of troops composing the centre is usually much more
considerable.
</p>

<p>
2. Because plainly the central point of a strip of country along which the
front of an army is extended must always be the most important point, as al=
l
the combinations of the campaign relate mostly to it, and therefore the fie=
ld
of battle is also usually nearer to it than to the wings.
</p>

<p>
3. Because, although a corps thrown forward in front of the centre does not
directly protect the wings as a real vanguard, it still contributes greatly=
 to
their security indirectly. For instance, the enemy cannot in ordinary cases
pass by such a corps within a certain distance in order to effect any
enterprise of importance against one of the wings, because he has to fear a=
n
attack in flank and rear. Even if this check which a corps thrown forward i=
n
the centre imposes on the enemy is not sufficient to constitute complete
security for the wings, it is at all events sufficient to relieve the flank=
s
from all apprehension in a great many cases.
</p>

<p>
The van-guard of the centre, if much stronger than that of a wing, that is =
to
say, if it consists of a special corps as advanced guard, has then not mere=
ly
the mission of a van-guard intended to protect the troops in its rear from
sudden surprise; it also operates in more general strategic relations as an
army corps thrown forward in advance.
</p>

<p>
The following are the purposes for which such a corps may be used, and
therefore those which determine its duties in practice.
</p>

<p>
1. To insure a stouter resistance, and make the enemy advance with more
caution; consequently to do the duties of a van-guard on a greater scale,
whenever our arrangements are such as to require time before they can be
carried into effect.
</p>

<p>
2. If the central mass of the army is very large, to be able to keep this
unwieldy body at some distance from the enemy, while we still remain close =
to
him with a more moveable body of troops.
</p>

<p>
3. That we may have a corps of observation close to the enemy, if there are=
 any
other reasons which require us to keep the principal mass of the army at a
considerable distance.
</p>

<p>
The idea that weaker look-out posts, mere partisan corps, might answer just=
 as
well for this observation is set aside at once if we reflect how easily a w=
eak
corps might be dispersed, and how very limited also are its means of
observation as compared with those of a considerable corps.
</p>

<p>
4. In the pursuit of the enemy. A single corps as advanced guard, with the
greater part of the cavalry attached to it, can move quicker, arriving late=
r at
its bivouac, and moving earlier in the morning than the whole mass.
</p>

<p>
5. Lastly, on a retreat, as rearguard, to be used in defending the principa=
l
natural obstacles of ground. In this respect also the centre is exceedingly
important. At first sight it certainly appears as if such a rearguard would=
 be
constantly in danger of having its flanks turned. But we must remember that=
,
even if the enemy succeeds in overlapping the flanks to some extent, he has
still to march the whole way from there to the centre before he can serious=
ly
threaten the central mass, which gives time to the rearguard of the centre =
to
prolong its resistance, and remain in rear somewhat longer. On the other ha=
nd,
the situation becomes at once critical if the centre falls back quicker tha=
n
the wings; there is immediately an appearance as if the line had been broke=
n
through, and even the very idea or appearance of that is to be dreaded. At =
no
time is there a greater necessity for concentration and holding together, a=
nd
at no time is this more sensibly felt by every one than on a retreat. The
intention always is, that the wings in case of extremity should close upon =
the
centre; and if, on account of subsistence and roads, the retreat has to be =
made
on a considerable width (of country), still the movement generally ends by =
a
concentration on the centre. If we add to these considerations also this on=
e,
that the enemy usually advances with his principal force in the centre and =
with
the greatest energy against the centre, we must perceive that the rear guar=
d of
the centre is of special importance.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, therefore, a special corps should always be thrown forward as =
an
advanced guard in every case where one of the above relations occurs. These
relations almost fall to the ground if the centre is not stronger than the
wings, as, for example, Macdonald when he advanced against Bl=C3=BCcher, in=
 Silesia,
in 1813, and the latter, when he made his movement towards the Elbe. Both o=
f
them had three corps, which usually moved in three columns by different roa=
ds,
the heads of the columns in line. On this account no mention is made of the=
ir
having had advanced guards.
</p>

<p>
But this disposition in three columns of equal strength is one which is by =
no
means to be recommended, partly on that account, and also because the divis=
ion
of a whole army into three parts makes it very unmanageable, as stated in t=
he
fifth chapter of the third book.
</p>

<p>
When the whole is formed into a centre with two wings separate from it, whi=
ch
we have represented in the preceding chapter as the most natural formation =
as
long as there is no particular object for any other, the corps forming the
advanced guard, according to the simplest notion of the case, will have its
place in front of the centre, and therefore before the line which forms the
front of the wings; but as the first object of corps thrown out on the flan=
ks
is to perform the same office for the sides as the advanced guard for the
front, it will very often happen that these corps will be in line with the
advanced guard, or even still further thrown forward, according to
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
With respect to the strength of an advanced guard we have little to say, as=
 now
very properly it is the general custom to detail for that duty one or more
component parts of the army of the first class, reinforced by part of the
cavalry: so that it consists of a corps, if the army is formed in corps; of=
 a
division, if the organisation is in divisions.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to perceive that in this respect also the great number of higher
members or divisions is an advantage.
</p>

<p>
How far the advanced guard should be pushed to the front must entirely depe=
nd
on circumstances; there are cases in which it may be more than a day=E2=80=
=99s
march in advance, and others in which it should be immediately before the f=
ront
of the army. If we find that in most cases between one and three miles is t=
he
distance chosen, that shows certainly that circumstances have usually point=
ed
out this distance as the best; but we cannot make of it a rule by which we =
are
to be always guided.
</p>

<p>
In the foregoing observations we have lost sight altogether of <i>outposts<=
/i>,
and therefore we must now return to them again.
</p>

<p>
In saying, at the commencement, that the relations between outposts and
stationary troops is similar to that between advanced guards and troops in
motion, our object was to refer the conceptions back to their origin, and k=
eep
them distinct in future; but it is clear that if we confine ourselves stric=
tly
to the words we should get little more than a pedantic distinction.
</p>

<p>
If an army on the march halts at night to resume the march next morning, th=
e
advanced guard must naturally do the same, and always organise the outpost
duty, required both for its own security and that of the main body, without=
 on
that account being changed from an advanced guard into a line of outposts. =
To
satisfy the notion of that transformation, the advanced guard would have to=
 be
completely broken up into a chain of small posts, having either only a very
small force, or none at all in a form approaching to a mass. In other words=
,
the idea of a line of outposts must predominate over that of a concentrated
corps.
</p>

<p>
The shorter the time of rest of the army, the less complete does the coveri=
ng
of the army require to be, for the enemy has hardly time to learn from day =
to
day what is covered and what is not. The longer the halt is to be the more
complete must be the observation and covering of all points of approach. As=
 a
rule, therefore, when the halt is long, the vanguard becomes always more an=
d
more extended into a line of posts. Whether the change becomes complete, or
whether the idea of a concentrated corps shall continue uppermost, depends
chiefly on two circumstances. The first is the proximity of the contending
armies, the second is the nature of the country.
</p>

<p>
If the armies are very close in comparison to the width of their front, the=
n it
will often be impossible to post a vanguard between them, and the armies ar=
e
obliged to place their dependence on a chain of outposts.
</p>

<p>
A concentrated corps, as it covers the approaches to the army less directly=
,
generally requires more time and space to act efficiently; and therefore, i=
f
the army covers a great extent of front, as in cantonments, and a corps
standing in mass is to cover all the avenues of approach, it is necessary t=
hat
we should be at a considerable distance from the enemy; on this account win=
ter
quarters, for instance, are generally covered by a cordon of posts.
</p>

<p>
The second circumstance is the nature of the country; where, for example, a=
ny
formidable obstacle of ground affords the means of forming a strong line of
posts with but few troops, we should not neglect to take advantage of it.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, in winter quarters, the rigour of the season may also be a reason f=
or
breaking up the advanced guard into a line of posts, because it is easier t=
o
find shelter for it in that way.
</p>

<p>
The use of a reinforced line of outposts was brought to great perfection by=
 the
Anglo-Dutch army, during the campaign of 1794 and 1795, in the Netherlands,
when the line of defence was formed by brigades composed of all arms, in si=
ngle
posts, and supported by a reserve. Scharnhorst, who was with that army,
introduced this system into the Prussian army on the Passarge in 1807.
Elsewhere in modern times, it has been little adopted, chiefly because the =
wars
have been too rich in movement. But even when there has been occasion for i=
ts
use it has been neglected, as for instance, by Murat, at Tarutino. A wider
extension of his defensive line would have spared him the loss of thirty pi=
eces
of artillery in a combat of out-posts.
</p>

<p>
It cannot be disputed that in certain circumstances, great advantages may b=
e
derived from this system. We propose to return to the subject on another
occasion.

<h3><a name=3D"chap54"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Mode of Action of Advanced Corp=
s</h3>

<p>
We have just seen how the security of the army is expected, from the effect
which an advanced guard and flank corps produce on an advancing enemy. Such
corps are always to be considered as very weak whenever we imagine them in
conflict with the main body of the enemy, and therefore a peculiar mode of
using them is required, that they may fulfil the purpose for which they are
intended, without incurring the risk of the serious loss which is to be fea=
red
from this disproportion in strength.
</p>

<p>
The object of a corps of this description, is to observe the enemy, and to
delay his progress.
</p>

<p>
For the first of these purposes a smaller body would never be sufficient,
partly because it would be more easily driven back, partly because its mean=
s of
observation that is its eyes could not reach as far.
</p>

<p>
But the observation must be carried to a high point; the enemy must be made=
 to
develop his whole strength before such a corps, and thereby reveal to a cer=
tain
extent, not only his force, but also his plans.
</p>

<p>
For this its mere presence would be sufficient, and it would only be necess=
ary
to wait and see the measures by which the enemy seeks to drive it back, and
then commence its retreat at once.
</p>

<p>
But further, it must also delay the advance of the enemy, and that implies
actual resistance.
</p>

<p>
Now how can we conceive this waiting until the last moment, as well as this
resistance, without such a corps being in constant danger of serious loss?
Chiefly in this way, that the enemy himself is preceded by an advanced guar=
d,
and therefore does not advance at once with all the outflanking and
overpowering weight of his whole force. Now, if this advance guard is also =
from
the commencement superior to our advanced corps, as we may naturally suppos=
e it
is intended it should be, and if the enemy=E2=80=99s main body is also near=
er to
his advanced guard than we are to ours, and if that main body, being alread=
y on
the march, will soon be on the spot to support the attack of his advanced g=
uard
with all his strength, still this first act, in which our advanced corps ha=
s to
contend with the enemy=E2=80=99s advanced guard, that is with a force not m=
uch
exceeding its own, ensures at once a certain gain of time, and thus allows =
of
our watching the adversary=E2=80=99s movements for some time without endang=
ering
our own retreat.
</p>

<p>
But even a certain amount of resistance which such a corps can offer in a
suitable position is not attended with such disadvantage as we might antici=
pate
in other cases through the disproportion in the strength of the forces enga=
ged.
The chief danger in a contest with a superior enemy consists always in the
possibility of being turned and placed in a critical situation by the enemy
enveloping our position; but in the case to which our attention is now
directed, a risk of this description is very much less, owing to the advanc=
ing
enemy never knowing exactly how near there may be support from the main bod=
y of
his opponent=E2=80=99s army itself, which may place his advanced column bet=
ween
two fires. The consequence is, that the enemy in advancing keeps the heads =
of
his single columns as nearly as possible in line, and only begins very
cautiously to attempt to turn one or other wing after he has sufficiently
reconnoitred our position. While the enemy is thus feeling about and moving
guardedly, the corps we have thrown forward has time to fall back before it=
 is
in any serious danger.
</p>

<p>
As for the length of the resistance which such a corps should offer against=
 the
attack in front, or against the commencement of any turning movement, that
depends chiefly on the nature of the ground and the proximity of the
enemy=E2=80=99s supports. If this resistance is continued beyond its natura=
l
measure, either from want of judgment or from a sacrifice being necessary i=
n
order to give the main body the time it requires, the consequence must alwa=
ys
be a very considerable loss.
</p>

<p>
It is only in rare instances, and more especially when some local obstacle =
is
favourable, that the resistance actually made in such a combat can be of
importance, and the duration of the little battle of such a corps would in
itself be hardly sufficient to gain the time required; that time is really
gained in a threefold manner, which lies in the nature of the thing, viz.:
</p>

<p>
1. By the more cautious, and consequently slower advance of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
2. By the duration of the actual resistance offered.
</p>

<p>
3. By the retreat itself.
</p>

<p>
This retreat must be made as slowly as is consistent with safety. If the
country affords good positions they should be made use of, as that obliges =
the
enemy to organise fresh attacks and plans for turning movements, and by tha=
t
means more time is gained. Perhaps in a new position a real combat even may
again be fought.
</p>

<p>
We see that the opposition to the enemy=E2=80=99s progress by actual fighti=
ng and
the retreat are completely combined with one another, and that the shortnes=
s of
the duration of the fights must be made up for by their frequent repetition=
.
</p>

<p>
This is the kind of resistance which an advanced corps should offer. The de=
gree
of effect depends chiefly on the strength of the corps, and the configurati=
on
of the country; next on the length of the road which the corps has to march
over, and the support which it receives.
</p>

<p>
A small body, even when the forces on both sides are equal can never make a=
s
long a stand as a considerable corps; for the larger the masses the more ti=
me
they require to complete their action, of whatever kind it may be. In a
mountainous country the mere marching is of itself slower, the resistance i=
n
the different positions longer, and attended with less danger, and at every
step favourable positions may be found.
</p>

<p>
As the distance to which a corps is pushed forward increases so will the le=
ngth
of its retreat, and therefore also the absolute gain of time by its resista=
nce;
but as such a corps by its position has less power of resistance in itself,=
 and
is less easily reinforced, its retreat must be made more rapidly in proport=
ion
than if it stood nearer the main body, and had a shorter distance to traver=
se.
</p>

<p>
The support and means of rallying afforded to an advanced corps must natura=
lly
have an influence on the duration of the resistance, as all the time that
prudence requires for the security of the retreat is so much taken from the
resistance, and therefore diminishes its amount.
</p>

<p>
There is a marked difference in the time gained by the resistance of an
advanced corps when the enemy makes his first appearance after midday; in s=
uch
a case the length of the night is so much additional time gained, as the
advance is seldom continued throughout the night. Thus it was that, in 1815=
, on
the short distance from Charleroi to Ligny, not more than two miles,(*) the
first Prussian corps under General Ziethen, about 30,000 strong, against
Buonaparte at the head of 120,000 men, was enabled to gain twenty-four hour=
s
for the Prussian army then engaged in concentrating. The first attack was m=
ade
on General Ziethen about nine o=E2=80=99clock on the morning of 15th June, =
and
the battle of Ligny did not commence until about two on the afternoon of 16=
th.
General Ziethen suffered, it is true, very considerable loss, amounting to =
five
or six thousand men killed, wounded or prisoners.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Here, as well as elsewhere, by the word mile, the German mile is
meant.=E2=80=94Tr.
</p>

<p>
If we refer to experience the following are the results, which may serve as=
 a
basis in any calculations of this kind.
</p>

<p>
A division of ten or twelve thousand men, with a proportion of cavalry, a
day=E2=80=99s march of three or four miles in advance in an ordinary countr=
y, not
particularly strong, will be able to detain the enemy (including time occup=
ied
in the retreat) about half as long again as he would otherwise require to m=
arch
over the same ground, but if the division is only a mile in advance, then t=
he
enemy ought to be detained about twice or three times as long as he otherwi=
se
would be on the march.
</p>

<p>
Therefore supposing the distance to be a march of four miles, for which usu=
ally
ten hours are required, then from the moment that the enemy appears in forc=
e in
front of the advanced corps, we may reckon upon fifteen hours before he is =
in a
condition to attack our main body. On the other hand, if the advanced guard=
 is
posted only a mile in advance, then the time which will elapse before our a=
rmy
can be attacked will be more than three or four hours, and may very easily =
come
up to double that, for the enemy still requires just as much time to mature=
 his
first measures against our advanced guard, and the resistance offered by th=
at
guard in its original position will be greater than it would be in a positi=
on
further forward.
</p>

<p>
The consequence is, that in the first of these supposed cases the enemy can=
not
easily make an attack on our main body on the same day that he presses back=
 the
advanced corps, and this exactly coincides with the results of experience. =
Even
in the second case the enemy must succeed in driving our advanced guard fro=
m
its ground in the first half of the day to have the requisite time for a
general action.
</p>

<p>
As the night comes to our help in the first of these supposed cases, we see=
 how
much time may be gained by an advanced guard thrown further forward.
</p>

<p>
With reference to corps placed on the sides or flanks, the object of which =
we
have before explained, the mode of action is in most cases more or less
connected with circumstances which belong to the province of immediate
application. The simplest way is to look upon them as advanced guards place=
d on
the sides, which being at the same time thrown out somewhat in advance, ret=
reat
in an oblique direction upon the army.
</p>

<p>
As these corps are not immediately in the front of the army, and cannot be =
so
easily supported as a regular advanced guard, they would, therefore, be exp=
osed
to greater danger if it was not that the enemy=E2=80=99s offensive power in=
 most
cases is somewhat less at the outer extremities of his line, and in the wor=
st
cases such corps have sufficient room to give way without exposing the army=
 so
directly to danger as a flying advanced guard would in its rapid retreat.
</p>

<p>
The most usual and best means of supporting an advanced corps is by a
considerable body of cavalry, for which reason, when necessary from the
distance at which the corps is advanced, the reserve cavalry is posted betw=
een
the main body and the advanced corps.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion to be drawn from the preceding reflections is, that an advan=
ced
corps effects more by its presence than by its efforts, less by the combats=
 in
which it engages than by the possibility of those in which it might engage:
that it should never attempt to stop the enemy=E2=80=99s movements, but onl=
y
serve like a pendulum to moderate and regulate them, so that they may be ma=
de
matter of calculation.

<h3><a name=3D"chap55"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>Camps</h3>

<p>
We are now considering the three situations of an army outside of the comba=
t
only strategically, that is, so far as they are conditioned by place, time,=
 and
the number of the effective force. All those subjects which relate to the
internal arrangement of the combat and the transition into the state of com=
bat
belong to tactics.
</p>

<p>
The disposition in camps, under which we mean every disposition of an army
except in quarters, whether it be in tents, huts, or bivouac, is strategica=
lly
completely identical with the combat which is contingent upon such disposit=
ion.
Tactically, it is not so always, for we can, for many reasons, choose a sit=
e
for encamping which is not precisely identical with the proposed field of
battle. Having already said all that is necessary on the disposition of an
army, that is, on the position of the different parts, we have only to make
some observations on camps in connection with their history.
</p>

<p>
In former times, that is, before armies grew once more to considerable
dimensions, before wars became of greater duration, and their partial acts
brought into connection with a whole or general plan, and up to the time of=
 the
war of the French Revolution, armies always used tents. This was their norm=
al
state. With the commencement of the mild season of the year they left their
quarters, and did not again take them up until winter set in. Winter quarte=
rs
at that time must to a certain extent be looked upon as a state of no war, =
for
in them the forces were neutralised, the whole clockwork stopped, quarters =
to
refresh an army which preceded the real winter quarters, and other temporar=
y
cantonments, for a short time within contracted limits were transitional an=
d
exceptional conditions.
</p>

<p>
This is not the place to enquire how such a periodical voluntary neutralisa=
tion
of power consisted with, or is now consistent with the object and being of =
war;
we shall come to that subject hereafter. Enough that it was so.
</p>

<p>
Since the wars of the French Revolution, armies have completely done away w=
ith
the tents on account of the encumbrance they cause. Partly it is found bett=
er
for an army of 100,000 men to have, in place of 6,000 tent horses, 5,000
additional cavalry, or a couple of hundred extra guns, partly it has been f=
ound
that in great and rapid operations a load of tents is a hindrance, and of
little use.
</p>

<p>
But this change is attended with two drawbacks, viz., an increase of casual=
ties
in the force, and greater wasting of the country.
</p>

<p>
However slight the protection afforded by a roof of common tent cloth,=E2=
=80=94it
cannot be denied that on a long continuance it is great relief to the troop=
s.
For a single day the difference is small, because a tent is little protecti=
on
against wind and cold, and does not completely exclude wet; but this small
difference, if repeated two or three hundred times in a year, becomes
important. A greater loss through sickness is just a natural result.
</p>

<p>
How the devastation of the country is increased through the want of tents f=
or
the troops requires no explanation.
</p>

<p>
One would suppose that on account of these two reactionary influences the d=
oing
away with tents must have diminished again the energy of war in another way=
,
that troops must remain longer in quarters, and from want of the requisites=
 for
encampment must forego many positions which would have been possible had te=
nts
been forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
This would indeed have been the case had there not been, in the same epoch =
of
time, an enormous revolution in war generally, which swallowed up in itself=
 all
these smaller subordinate influences.
</p>

<p>
The elementary fire of war has become so overpowering, its energy so
extraordinary, that these regular periods of rest also have disappeared, an=
d
every power presses forward with persistent force towards the great decisio=
n,
which will be treated of more fully in the ninth book. Under these
circumstances, therefore, any question about effects on an army from the
discontinuance of the use of tents in the field is quite thrown into the sh=
ade.
Troops now occupy huts, or bivouac under the canopy of heaven, without rega=
rd
to season of the year, weather, or locality, just according as the general =
plan
and object of the campaign require.
</p>

<p>
Whether war will in the future continue to maintain, under all circumstance=
s
and at all times, this energy, is a question we shall consider hereafter; w=
here
this energy is wanting, the want of tents is calculated to exercise some
influence on the conduct of war; but that this reaction will ever be strong
enough to bring back the use of tents is very doubtful, because now that mu=
ch
wider limits have been opened for the elements of war it will never return
within its old narrow bounds, except occasionally for a certain time and un=
der
certain circumstances, only to break out again with the all-powerful force =
of
its nature. Permanent arrangements for an army must, therefore, be based on=
ly
upon that nature.
</p>

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap56"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>Marches</h3>

<p>
Marches are a mere passage from one position to another under two primary
conditions.
</p>

<p>
The first is the due care of the troops, so that no forces shall be squande=
red
uselessly when they might be usefully employed; the second, is precision in=
 the
movements, so that they may fit exactly. If we marched 100,000 men in one
single column, that is, upon one road without intervals of time, the rear o=
f
the column would never arrive at the proposed destination on the same day w=
ith
the head of the column; we must either advance at an unusually slow pace, o=
r
the mass would, like a thread of water, disperse itself in drops; and this
dispersion, together with the excessive exertion laid upon those in rear ow=
ing
to the length of the column, would soon throw everything into confusion.
</p>

<p>
If from this extreme we take the opposite direction, we find that the small=
er
the mass of troops in one column the greater the ease and precision with wh=
ich
the march can be performed. The result of this is the need of a <i>division=
</i>
quite irrespective of that division of an army in separate parts which belo=
ngs
to its position; therefore, although the division into columns of march
originates in the strategic disposition in general, it does not do so in ev=
ery
particular case. A great mass which is to be concentrated at any one point =
must
necessarily be divided for the march. But even if a disposition of the army=
 in
separate parts causes a march in separate divisions, sometimes the conditio=
ns
of the primitive disposition, sometimes those of the march, are paramount. =
For
instance, if the disposition of the troops is one made merely for rest, one=
 in
which a battle is not expected, then the conditions of the march predominat=
e,
and these conditions are chiefly the choice of good, well-frequented roads.
Keeping in view this difference, we choose a road in the one case on accoun=
t of
the quarters and camping ground, in the other we take the quarters and camp=
s
such as they are, on account of the road. When a battle is expected, and
everything depends on our reaching a particular point with a mass of troops=
,
then we should think nothing of getting to that point by even the worst
by-roads, if necessary; if, on the other hand, we are still on the journey =
to
the theatre of war, then the nearest great roads are selected for the colum=
ns,
and we look out for the best quarters and camps that can be got near them.
</p>

<p>
Whether the march is of the one kind or the other, if there is a possibilit=
y of
a combat, that is within the whole region of actual war, it is an invariabl=
e
rule in the modern art of war to organise the columns so that the mass of
troops composing each column is fit of itself to engage in an independent
combat. This condition is satisfied by the combination of the three arms, b=
y an
organised subdivision of the whole, and by the appointment of a competent
commander. Marches, therefore, have been the chief cause of the new order o=
f
battle, and they profit most by it.
</p>

<p>
When in the middle of the last century, especially in the theatre of war in
which Frederick II. was engaged, generals began to look upon movement as a
principle belonging to fighting, and to think of gaining the victory by the
effect of unexpected movements, the want of an organised order of battle ca=
used
the most complicated and laborious evolutions on a march. In carrying out a
movement near the enemy, an army ought to be always ready to fight; but at =
that
time they were never ready to fight unless the whole army was collectively
present, because nothing less than the army constituted a complete whole. I=
n a
march to a flank, the second line, in order to be always at the regulated
distance, that is about a quarter of a mile from the first, had to march up
hill and down dale, which demanded immense exertion, as well as a great sto=
ck
of local knowledge; for where can one find two good roads running parallel =
at a
distance of a quarter of a mile from each other? The cavalry on the wings h=
ad
to encounter the same difficulties when the march was direct to the front.
There was other difficulty with the artillery, which required a road for
itself, protected by infantry; for the lines of infantry required to be
continuous lines, and the artillery increased the length of their already l=
ong
trailing columns still more, and threw all their regulated distances into
disorder. It is only necessary to read the dispositions for marches in
Tempelhof=E2=80=99s History of the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, to be satisfie=
d of all
these incidents and of the restraints thus imposed on the action of war.
</p>

<p>
But since then the modern art of war has subdivided armies on a regular
principle, so that each of the principal parts forms in itself a complete
whole, of small proportions, but capable of acting in battle precisely like=
 the
great whole, except in one respect, which is, that the duration of its acti=
on
must be shorter. The consequence of this change is, that even when it is
intended that the whole force should take part in a battle, it is no longer
necessary to have the columns so close to each other that they may unite be=
fore
the commencement of the combat; it is sufficient now if the concentration t=
akes
place in the course of the action.
</p>

<p>
The smaller a body of troops the more easily it can be moved, and therefore=
 the
less it requires that subdivision which is not a result of the separate
disposition, but of the unwieldiness of the mass. A small body, therefore, =
can
march upon one road, and if it is to advance on several lines it easily fin=
ds
roads near each other which are as good as it requires. The greater the mas=
s
the greater becomes the necessity for subdividing, the greater becomes the
number of columns, and the want of made roads, or even great high roads,
consequently also the distance of the columns from each other. Now the dang=
er
of this subdivision is arithmetically expressed in an inverse ratio to the
necessity for it. The smaller the parts are, the more readily must they be =
able
to render assistance to each other; the larger they are, the longer they ca=
n be
left to depend on themselves. If we only call to mind what has been said in=
 the
preceding book on this subject, and also consider that in cultivated countr=
ies
at a few miles distance from the main road there are always other tolerably
good roads running in a parallel direction, it is easy to see that, in
regulating a march, there are no great difficulties which make rapidity and
precision in the advance incompatible with the proper concentration of forc=
e.
In a mountainous country parallel roads are both scarce, and the difficulti=
es
of communication between them great; but the defensive powers of a single
column are very much greater.
</p>

<p>
In order to make this idea clearer let us look at it for a moment in a conc=
rete
form.
</p>

<p>
A division of 8,000 men, with its artillery and other carriages, takes up, =
as
we know by experience in ordinary cases, a space of one league; if, therefo=
re,
two divisions march one after the other on the same road, the second arrive=
s
one hour after the first; but now, as said in the sixth chapter of the four=
th
book, a division of this strength is quite capable of maintaining a combat =
for
several hours, even against a superior force, and, therefore, supposing the
worst, that is, supposing the first had to commence a fight instantaneously=
,
still the second division would not arrive too late. Further, within a leag=
ue
right and left of the road on which we march, in the cultivated countries o=
f
central Europe there are, generally, lateral roads which can be used for a
march, so that there is no necessity to go across country, as was so often =
done
in the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War.
</p>

<p>
Again, it is known by experience that the head of a column composed of four
divisions and a reserve of cavalry, even on indifferent roads, generally ge=
ts
over a march of three miles in eight hours; now, if we reckon for each divi=
sion
one league in depth, and the same for the reserve cavalry and artillery, th=
en
the whole march will last thirteen hours. This is no great length of time, =
and
yet in this case forty thousand men would have marched over the same road. =
But
with such a mass as this we can make use of lateral roads, which are to be
found at a greater distance, and therefore easily shorten the march. If the
mass of troops marching on the same road is still greater than above suppos=
ed,
then it is a case in which the arrival of the whole on the same day is no
longer indispensable, for such masses never give battle now the moment they
meet, usually not until the next day.
</p>

<p>
We have introduced these concrete cases, not as exhausting considerations o=
f
this kind, but to make ourselves more intelligible, and by means of this gl=
ance
at the results of experience to show that in the present mode of conducting=
 war
the organisation of marches no longer offers such great difficulties; that =
the
most rapid marches, executed with the greatest precision, no longer require
either that peculiar skill or that exact knowledge of the country which was
needed for Frederick=E2=80=99s rapid and exact marches in the Seven Years=
=E2=80=99
War. Through the existing organisation of armies, they rather go on now alm=
ost
of themselves, at least without any great preparatory plans. In times past,
battles were conducted by mere word of command, but marches required a regu=
lar
plan, now the order of battle requires the latter, and for a march the word=
 of
command almost suffices.
</p>

<p>
As is well known, all marches are either perpendicular [to the front] or
parallel. The latter, also called flank marches, alter the geometrical posi=
tion
of the divisions; those parts which, in position, were in line, will follow=
 one
another, and <i>vice versa</i>. Now, although the line of march may be at a=
ny
angle with the front, still the order of the march must decidedly be of one=
 or
other of these classes.
</p>

<p>
This geometrical alteration could only be completely carried out by tactics=
,
and by it only through the file-march as it is called, which, with great
masses, is impossible. Far less is it possible for strategy to do it. The p=
arts
which changed their geometrical relation in the old order of battle were on=
ly
the centre and wings; in the new they are the divisions of the first rank
corps, divisions, or even brigades, according to the organisation of the ar=
my.
Now, the consequences above deduced from the new order of battle have an
influence here also, for as it is no longer so necessary, as formerly, that=
 the
whole army should be assembled before action commences, therefore the great=
er
care is taken that those troops which march together form one whole (a unit=
).
If two divisions were so placed that one formed the reserve to the other, a=
nd
that they were to advance against the enemy upon two roads, no one would th=
ink
of sending a portion of each division by each of the roads, but a road woul=
d at
once be assigned to each division; they would therefore march side by side,=
 and
each general of division would be left to provide a reserve for himself in =
case
of a combat. Unity of command is much more important than the original
geometrical relation; if the divisions reach their new position without a
combat, they can resume their previous relations. Much less if two division=
s,
standing together, are to make a <i>parallel</i> (flank) march upon two roa=
ds
should we think of placing the second line or reserve of each division on t=
he
rear road; instead of that, we should allot to each of the divisions one of=
 the
roads, and therefore during the march consider one division as forming the
reserve to the other. If an army in four divisions, of which three form the
front line and the fourth the reserve, is to march against the enemy in tha=
t
order, then it is natural to assign a road to each of the divisions in fron=
t,
and cause the reserve to follow the centre. If there are not three roads at=
 a
suitable distance apart, then we need not hesitate at once to march upon tw=
o
roads, as no serious inconvenience can arise from so doing.
</p>

<p>
It is the same in the opposite case, the flank march.
</p>

<p>
Another point is the march off of columns from the right flank or left. In
parallel marches (marches to a flank) the thing is plain in itself. No one
would march off from the right to make a movement to the left flank. In a m=
arch
to the front or rear, the order of march should properly be chosen accordin=
g to
the direction of the lines of roads in respect to the future line of
deployment. This may also be done frequently in tactics, as its spaces are
smaller, and therefore a survey of the geometrical relations can be more ea=
sily
taken. In strategy it is quite impossible, and therefore although we have s=
een
here and there a certain analogy brought over into strategy from tactics, i=
t
was mere pedantry. Formerly the whole order of march was a purely tactical
affair, because the army on a march remained always an indivisible whole, a=
nd
looked to nothing but a combat of the whole; yet nevertheless Schwerin, for
example, when he marched off from his position near Brandeis, on the 5th of
May, could not tell whether his future field of battle would be on his righ=
t or
left, and on this account he was obliged to make his famous countermarch.
</p>

<p>
If an army in the old order of battle advanced against the enemy in four
columns, the cavalry in the first and second lines on each wing formed the =
two
exterior columns, the two lines of infantry composing the wings formed the =
two
central columns. Now these columns could march off all from the right or al=
l
from the left, or the right wing from the right, the left wing from the lef=
t,
or the left from the right, and the right from the left. In the latter case=
 it
would have been called =E2=80=9Cdouble column from the centre.=E2=80=9D But=
 all
these forms, although they ought to have had a relation directly to the fut=
ure
deployment, were really all quite indifferent in that respect. When Frederi=
ck
the Great entered on the battle of Leuthen, his army had been marched off b=
y
wings from the right in four columns, therefore the wonderful transition to=
 a
march off in order of battle, as described by all writers of history, was d=
one
with the greatest ease, because it happened that the king chose to attack t=
he
left wing of the Austrians; had he wanted to turn their right, he must have
countermarched his army, as he did at Prague.
</p>

<p>
If these forms did not meet that object in those days, they would be mere
trifling as regards it now. We know now just as little as formerly the
situation of the future battle-field in reference to the road we take; and =
the
little loss of time occasioned by marching off in inverted order is now
infinitely less important than formerly. The new order of battle has furthe=
r a
beneficial influence in this respect, that it is now immaterial which divis=
ion
arrives first or which brigade is brought under fire first.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances the march off from the right or left is of no
consequence now, otherwise than that when it is done alternately it tends t=
o
equalise the fatigue which the troops undergo. This, which is the only obje=
ct,
is certainly an important one for retaining both modes of marching off with
large bodies.
</p>

<p>
The advance from the centre as a definite evolution naturally comes to an e=
nd
on account of what has just been stated, and can only take place accidental=
ly.
An advance from the centre by one and the same column in strategy is, in po=
int
of fact, nonsense, for it supposes a double road.
</p>

<p>
The order of march belongs, moreover, more to the province of tactics than =
to
that of strategy, for it is the division of a whole into parts, which, afte=
r
the march, are once more to resume the state of a whole. As, however, in mo=
dern
warfare the formal connection of the parts is not required to be constantly
kept up during a march, but on the contrary, the parts during the march may
become further separated, and therefore be left more to their own resources=
,
therefore it is much easier now for independent combats to happen in which =
the
parts have to sustain themselves, and which, therefore must be reckoned as
complete combats in themselves, and on that account we have thought it
necessary to say so much on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Further, an order of battle in three parts in juxtaposition being, as we ha=
ve
seen in the second 1 chapter of this book, the most natural where no specia=
l
object predominates, from that results also that the order of march in thre=
e
columns is the most natural.
</p>

<p>
It only remains to observe that the notion of a column in strategy does not
found itself mainly on the line of march of one body of troops. The term is
used in strategy to designate masses of troops marching on the same road on
different days as well. For the division into columns is made chiefly to
shorten and facilitate the march, as a small number marches quicker and mor=
e
conveniently than large bodies. But this end may, be attained by marching
troops on different days, as well as by marching them on different roads.

<h3><a name=3D"chap57"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>Marches (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>

<p>
Respecting the length of a march and the time it requires, it is natural fo=
r us
to depend on the general results of experience.
</p>

<p>
For our modern armies it has long been settled that a march of three miles
should be the usual day=E2=80=99s work which, on long distances, may be set=
 down
as an average distance of two miles per day, allowing for the necessary res=
t
days, to make such repairs of all kinds as may be required.
</p>

<p>
Such a march in a level country, and on tolerable roads will occupy a divis=
ion
of 8,000 men from eight to ten hours; in a hilly country from ten to twelve
hours. If several divisions are united in one column, the march will occupy=
 a
couple of hours longer, without taking into account the intervals which mus=
t
elapse between the departure of the first and succeeding divisions.
</p>

<p>
We see, therefore, that the day is pretty well occupied with such a march; =
that
the fatigue endured by a soldier loaded with his pack for ten or twelve hou=
rs
is not to be judged of by that of an ordinary journey of three miles on foo=
t
which a person, on tolerable roads, might easily get over in five hours.
</p>

<p>
The longest marches to be found in exceptional instances are of five, or at
most six miles a day; for a continuance four.
</p>

<p>
A march of five miles requires a halt for several hours; and a division of
8,000 men will not do it, even on a good road, in less than sixteen hours. =
If
the march is one of six miles, and that there are several divisions in the
column, we may reckon upon at least twenty hours.
</p>

<p>
We here mean the march of a number of whole divisions at once, from one cam=
p to
another, for that is the usual form of marches made on a theatre of war. Wh=
en
several divisions are to march in one column, the first division to move is
assembled and marched off earlier than the rest, and therefore arrives at i=
ts
camping ground so much the sooner. At the same time this difference can sti=
ll
never amount to the whole time, which corresponds to the depth of a divisio=
n on
the line of march, and which is so well expressed in French, as the time it
requires for its <i>d=C3=A9coulement</i> (running down). The soldier is, th=
erefore,
saved very little fatigue in this way, and every march is very much lengthe=
ned
in duration in proportion as the number of troops to be moved increases. To
assemble and march off the different brigades of a division, in like manner=
 at
different times, is seldom practicable, and for that reason we have taken t=
he
division itself as the unit.
</p>

<p>
In long distances, when troops march from one cantonment into another, and =
go
over the road in small bodies, and without points of assembly, the distance
they go over daily may certainly be increased, and in point of fact it is s=
o,
from the necessary detours in getting to quarters.
</p>

<p>
But those marches, on which troops have to assemble daily in divisions, or
perhaps in corps, and have an additional move to get into quarters, take up=
 the
most time, and are only advisable in rich countries, and where the masses o=
f
troops are not too large, as in such cases the greater facilility of
subsistence and the advantage of the shelter which the troops obtain compen=
sate
sufficiently for the fatigue of a longer march. The Prussian army undoubted=
ly
pursued a wrong system in their retreat in 1806 in taking up quarters for t=
he
troops every night on account of subsistence. They could have procured
subsistence in bivouacs, and the army would not have been obliged to spend
fourteen days in getting over fifty miles of ground, which, after all, they
only accomplished by extreme efforts.
</p>

<p>
If a bad road or a hilly country has to be marched over, all these calculat=
ions
as to time and distance undergo such modifications that it is difficult to
estimate, with any certainty, in any particular case, the time required for=
 a
march; much less, then, can any general theory be established. All that the=
ory
can do is to direct attention to the liability to error with which we are h=
ere
beset. To avoid it the most careful calculation is necessary, and a large
margin for unforeseen delays. The influence of weather and condition of the
troops also come into consideration.
</p>

<p>
Since the doing away with tents and the introduction of the system of
subsisting troops by compulsory demands for provisions on the spot, the bag=
gage
of an army has been very sensibly diminished, and as a natural and most
important consequence we look first for an acceleration in the movements of=
 an
army, and, therefore, of course, an increase in the length of the day=E2=80=
=99s
march. This, however, is only realized under certain circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Marches within the theatre of war have been very little accelerated by this
means, for it is well known that for many years whenever the object require=
d
marches of unusual length it has always been the practice to leave the bagg=
age
behind or send it on beforehand, and, generally, to keep it separate from t=
he
troops during the continuance of such movements, and it had in general no
influence on the movement, because as soon as it was out of the way, and ce=
ased
to be a direct impediment, no further trouble was taken about it, whatever
damage it might suffer in that way. Marches, therefore, took place in the S=
even
Years=E2=80=99 War, which even now cannot be surpassed; as an instance we c=
ite
Lascy=E2=80=99s march in 1760, when he had to support the diversion of the
Russians on Berlin, on that occasion he got over the road from Schweidnitz =
to
Berlin through Lusatia, a distance of 225 miles, in ten days, averaging, th=
erefore, twenty-two
miles a day, which, for a Corps of 15,000, would be an extraordinary
march even in these days.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, through the new method of supplying troops the movements=
 of
armies have acquired a new <i>retarding</i> principle. If troops have partl=
y to
procure supplies for themselves, which often happens, then they require mor=
e
time for the service of supply than would be necessary merely to receive
rations from provision wagons. Besides this, on marches of considerable
duration troops cannot be encamped in such large numbers at any one point; =
the
divisions must be separated from one another, in order the more easily to
manage for them. Lastly, it almost always happens that it is necessary to p=
lace
part of the army, particularly the cavalry, in quarters. All this occasions=
 on
the whole a sensible delay. We find, therefore, that Buonaparte in pursuit =
of
the Prussians in 1806, with a view to cut off their retreat, and Bl=C3=BCch=
er in
1815, in pursuit of the French, with a like object, only accomplished thirt=
y
miles in ten days, a rate which Frederick the Great was able to attain in h=
is
marches from Saxony to Silesia and back, notwithstanding all the train that=
 he
had to carry with him.
</p>

<p>
At the same time the mobility and handiness, if we may use such an expressi=
on,
of the parts of an army, both great and small, on the theatre of war have v=
ery
perceptibly gained by the diminution of baggage. Partly, inasmuch as while =
the
number of cavalry and guns is the same, there are fewer horses, and therefo=
re,
there is less forage required; partly, inasmuch as we are no longer so much
tied to any one position, because we have not to be for ever looking after =
a
long train of baggage dragging after us.
</p>

<p>
Marches such as that, which, after raising the siege of Olm=C3=BCtz, 1758, =
Frederick
the Great made with 4,000 carriages, the escort of which employed half his =
army
broken up into single battalions and companies, could not be effected now i=
n
presence of even the most timid adversary.
</p>

<p>
On long marches, as from the Tagus to the Niemen, that lightening of the ar=
my
is more sensibly felt, for although the usual measure of the day=E2=80=99s =
march
remains the same on account of the carriages still remaining, yet, in cases=
 of
great urgency, we can exceed that usual measure at a less sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Generally the diminution of baggage tends more to a saving of power than to=
 the
acceleration of movement.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap58"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>Marches (<i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>
We have now to consider the destructive influence which marches have upon a=
n
army. It is so great that it may be regarded as an active principle of
destruction, just as much as the combat.
</p>

<p>
One single moderate march does not wear down the instrument, but a successi=
on
of even moderate marches is certain to tell upon it, and a succession of se=
vere
ones will, of course, do so much sooner.
</p>

<p>
At the actual scene of war, want of food and shelter, bad broken-up roads, =
and
the necessity of being in a perpetual state of readiness for battle, are ca=
uses
of an excessive strain upon our means, by which men, cattle, carriages of e=
very
description as well as clothing are ruined.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly said that a long rest does not suit the physical health of a=
n
army; that at such a time there is more sickness than during moderate activ=
ity.
No doubt sickness will and does occur if soldiers are packed too close in
confined quarters; but the same thing would occur if these were quarters ta=
ken
up on the march, and the want of air and exercise can never be the cause of
such sicknesses, as it is so easy to give the soldier both by means of his
exercises.
</p>

<p>
Only think for a moment, when the organism of a human being is in a disorde=
red
and fainting state, what a difference it must make to him whether he falls =
sick
in a house or is seized in the middle of a high road, up to his knees in mu=
d,
under torrents of rain, and loaded with a knapsack on his back; even if he =
is
in a camp he can soon be sent to the next village, and will not be entirely
without medical assistance, whilst on a march he must be for hours without =
any
assistance, and then be made to drag himself along for miles as a straggler=
.
How many trifling illnesses by that means become serious, how many serious =
ones
become mortal. Let us consider how an ordinary march in the dust, and under=
 the
burning rays of a summer sun may produce the most excessive heat, in which
state, suffering from intolerable thirst, the soldier then rushes to the fr=
esh
spring of water, to bring back for himself sickness and death.
</p>

<p>
It is not our object by these reflections to recommend less activity in war=
;
the instrument is there for use, and if the use wears away the instrument t=
hat
is only in the natural order of things; we only wish to see every thing put=
 in
its right place, and to oppose that theoretical bombast according to which =
the
most astonishing surprises the most rapid movements, the most incessant
activity cost nothing, and are painted as rich mines which the indolence of=
 the
general leaves unworked. It is very much the same with these mines as with
those from which gold and silver are obtained; nothing is seen but the prod=
uce,
and no one asks about the value of the work which has brought this produce =
to
light.
</p>

<p>
On long marches outside a theatre of war, the conditions under which the ma=
rch
is made are no doubt usually easier, and the daily losses smaller, but on t=
hat
account men with the slightest sickness are generally lost to the army for =
some
time, as it is difficult for convalescents to overtake an army constantly
advancing.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the cavalry the number of lame horses and horses with sore backs ri=
ses
in an increasing ratio, and amongst the carriages many break down or requir=
e
repair. It never fails, therefore, that at the end of a march of 100 miles =
or
more, an army arrives much weakened, particularly as regards its cavalry an=
d
train.
</p>

<p>
If such marches are necessary on the theatre of war, that is under the eyes=
 of
the enemy, then that disadvantage is added to the other, and from the two
combined the losses with large masses of troops, and under conditions other=
wise
unfavourable may amount to something incredible.
</p>

<p>
Only a couple of examples in order to illustrate our ideas.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte crossed the Niemen on 24th June, 1812, the enormous centre =
of
his army with which he subsequently marched against Moscow numbered 301,000
men. At Smolensk, on the 15th August, he detached 13,500, leaving, it is to=
 be
supposed, 287,500. The actual state of his army however at that date was on=
ly
182,000; he had therefore lost 105,000.(*) Bearing in mind that up to that =
time
only two engagements to speak of had taken place, one between Davoust and
Bragathion, the other between Murat and Tolstoy-Osterman, we may put down t=
he
losses of the French army in action at 10,000 men at most, and therefore th=
e
losses in sick and stragglers within fifty-two days on a march of about sev=
enty
miles direct to his front, amounted to 95,000, that is a third part of the
whole army.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) All these figures are taken from Chambray. Vergl. Bd. vii. 2<sup>te</su=
p>
Auflage, =C2=A7 80, ff.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks later, at the time of the battle of Borodino, the loss amounted=
 to
144,000 (including the casualties in the battle), and eight days after that
again, at Moscow, the number was 198,000. The losses of this army in genera=
l
were at the commencement of the campaign at the rate of 1/150daily,
subsequently they rose to 1/120, and in the last period they increased to 1=
/19
of the original strength.
</p>

<p>
The movement of Napoleon from the passage of the Niemen up to Moscow certai=
nly
may be called a persistent one; still, we must not forget that it lasted
eighty-two days, in which time he only accomplished 120 miles, and that the
French army upon two occasions made regular halts, once at Wilna for about
fourteen days, and the other time at Witebsk for about eleven days, during
which periods many stragglers had time to rejoin. This fourteen weeks=E2=80=
=99
advance was not made at the worst season of the year, nor over the worst of
roads, for it was summer, and the roads along which they marched were mostl=
y
sand. It was the immense mass of troops collected on one road, the want of
sufficient subsistence, and an enemy who was on the retreat, but by no mean=
s in
flight, which were the adverse conditions.
</p>

<p>
Of the retreat of the French army from Moscow to the Niemen, we shall say
nothing, but this we may mention, that the Russian army following them left
Kaluga 120,000 strong, and reached Wilna with 30,000. Every one knows how f=
ew
men were lost in actual combats during that period.
</p>

<p>
One more example from Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s campaign of 1813 in Silesia an=
d Saxony, a
campaign very remarkable not for any long march but for the amount of march=
ing
to and fro. York=E2=80=99s corps of Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s army began this =
campaign 16th
August about 40,000 strong, and was reduced to 12,000 at the battle of Leip=
sic,
19th October. The principal combats which this corps fought at Goldberg,
Lowenberg, on the Katsbach, at Wartenburg, and Mockern (Leipsic) cost it, o=
n
the authority of the best writers, 12,000 men. According to that their loss=
es
from other causes in eight weeks amounted to 16,000, or two-fifths of the
whole.
</p>

<p>
We must, therefore, make up our minds to great wear and tear of our own for=
ces,
if we are to carry on a war rich in movements, we must arrange the rest of =
our
plan accordingly, and above all things the reinforcements which are to foll=
ow.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap59"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>Cantonments</h3>

<p>
In the modern system of war cantonments have become again indispensable,
because neither tents nor a complete military train make an army independen=
t of
them. Huts and open-air camps (bivouacs as they are called), however far su=
ch
arrangements may be carried, can still never become the usual way of locati=
ng
troops without sickness gaining the upper hand, and prematurely exhausting
their strength, sooner or later, according to the state of the weather or
climate. The campaign in Russia in 1812 is one of the few in which, in a ve=
ry
severe climate, the troops, during the six months that it lasted hardly eve=
r
lay in cantonments. But what was the consequence of this extreme effort, wh=
ich
should be called an extravagance, if that term was not much more applicable=
 to
the political conception of the enterprise!
</p>

<p>
Two things interfere with the occupation of cantonments the proximity of th=
e
enemy, and the rapidity of movement. For these reasons they are quitted as =
soon
as the decision approaches, and cannot be again taken up until the decision=
 is
over.
</p>

<p>
In modern wars, that=E2=80=99s, in all campaigns during the last twenty-fiv=
e
years which occur to us at this moment, the military element has acted with
full energy. Nearly all that was possible has generally been done in them, =
as
far as regards activity and the utmost effort of force; but all these campa=
igns
have been of short duration, they have seldom exceeded half a year; in most=
 of
them a few months sufficed to bring matters to a crisis, that is, to a poin=
t
where the vanquished enemy saw himself compelled to sue for an armistice or=
 at
once for peace, or to a point where, on the conqueror=E2=80=99s part, the i=
mpetus
of victory had exhausted itself. During this period of extreme effort there
could be little question of cantonments, for even in the victorious march o=
f
the pursuer, if there was no longer any danger, the rapidity of movement ma=
de
that kind of relief impossible.
</p>

<p>
But when from any cause the course of events is less impetuous, when a more
even oscillation and balancing of forces takes place, then the housing of
troops must again become a foremost subject for attention. This want has so=
me
influence even on the conduct of war itself, partly in this way, that we se=
ek
to gain more time and security by a stronger system of outposts, by a more
considerable advanced guard thrown further forward; and partly in this way,
that our measures are governed more by the richness and fertility of the
country than by the tactical advantages which the ground affords in the
geometrical relations of lines and points. A commercial town of twenty or
thirty thousand inhabitants, a road thickly studded with large villages or
flourishing towns give such facilities for the assembling in one position l=
arge
bodies of troops, and this concentration gives such a freedom and such a
latitude for movement as fully compensate for the advantages which the bett=
er
situation of some point may otherwise present.
</p>

<p>
On the form to be followed in arranging cantonments we have only a few
observations to make, as this subject belongs for the most part to tactics.
</p>

<p>
The housing of troops comes under two heads, inasmuch as it can either be t=
he
main point or only a secondary consideration. If the disposition of the tro=
ops
in the course of a campaign is regulated by grounds purely tactical and
strategical, and if, as is done more especially with cavalry, they are dire=
cted
for their comfort to occupy the quarters available in the vicinity of the p=
oint
of concentration of the army, then the quarters are subordinate considerati=
ons
and substitutes for camps; they must, therefore, be chosen within such a ra=
dius
that the troops can reach the point of assembly in good time. But if an arm=
y
takes up quarters to rest and refresh, then the housing of the troops is th=
e
main point, and other measures, consequently also the selection of the
particular point of assembly, will be influenced by that object.
</p>

<p>
The first question for examination here is as to the general form of the
cantonments as a whole. The usual form is that of a very long oval, a mere
widening as it were of the tactical order of battle. The point of assembly =
for
the army is in front, the head-quarters in rear. Now these three arrangemen=
ts
are, in point of fact, adverse, indeed almost opposed, to the safe assembly=
 of
the army on the approach of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The more the cantonments form a square, or rather a circle, the quicker the
troops can concentrate at one point, that is the centre. The further the pl=
ace
of assembly is placed in rear, the longer the enemy will be in reaching it,
and, therefore, the more time is left us to assemble. A point of assembly i=
n
rear of the cantonments can never be in danger. And, on the other hand, the
farther the head-quarters are in advance, so much the sooner reports arrive=
,
therefore so much the better is the commander informed of everything. At th=
e
same time, the first named arrangements are not devoid of points which dese=
rve
some attention.
</p>

<p>
By the extension of cantonments in width, we have in view the protection of=
 the
country which would otherwise be laid under contributions by the enemy. But
this motive is neither thoroughly sound, nor is it very important. It is on=
ly
sound as far as regards the country on the extremity of the wings, but does=
 not
apply at all to intermediate spaces existing between separate divisions of =
the
army, if the quarters of those divisions are drawn closer round their point=
 of
assembly, for no enemy will then venture into those intervals of space. And=
 it
is not very important, because there are simpler means of shielding the
districts in our vicinity from the enemy=E2=80=99s requisitions than scatte=
ring
the army itself.
</p>

<p>
The placing of the point of assembly in front is with a view to covering th=
e
quarters, for the following reasons: In the first place, a body of troops,
suddenly called to arms, always leaves behind it in cantonments a tail of
stragglers sick, baggage, provisions, etc., etc. which may easily fall into=
 the
enemy=E2=80=99s hands if the point of assembly is placed in rear. In the se=
cond
place, we have to apprehend that if the enemy with some bodies of cavalry
passes by the advanced guard, or if it is defeated in any way, he may fall =
upon
scattered regiments or battalions. If he encounters a force drawn up in goo=
d
order, although it is weak, and in the end must be overpowered, still he is
brought to a stop, and in that way time is gained.
</p>

<p>
As respects the position of the head-quarters, it is generally supposed tha=
t it
cannot be made too secure.
</p>

<p>
According to these different considerations, we may conclude that the best
arrangement for districts of cantonments is where they take an oblong form,
approaching the square or circle, have the point of assembly in the centre,=
 and
the head-quarters placed on the front line, well protected by considerable
masses of troops.
</p>

<p>
What we have said as to covering of the wings in treating of the dispositio=
n of
the army in general, applies here also; therefore corps detached from the m=
ain
body, right and left, although intended to fight in conjunction with the re=
st,
will have particular points of assembly of their own in the same line with =
the
main body.
</p>

<p>
Now, if we reflect that the nature of a country, on the one hand, by favour=
able
features in the ground determines the most natural point of assembly, and o=
n
the other hand, by the positions of towns and villages determines the most
suitable situation for cantonments, then we must perceive how very rarely a=
ny
geometrical form can be decisive in our present subject. But yet it was
necessary to direct attention to it, because, like all general laws, it aff=
ects
the generality of cases in a greater or less degree.
</p>

<p>
What now remains to be said as to an advantageous position for cantonments =
is
that they should be taken up behind some natural obstacle of ground affordi=
ng
cover, whilst the sides next the enemy can be watched by small but numerous
detached parties; or they may be taken up behind fortresses, which, when
circumstances prevent any estimate being formed of the strength of their
garrisons, impose upon the enemy a greater feeling of respect and and cauti=
on.
</p>

<p>
We reserve the subject of winter quarters, covered by defensive works for a
separate article.
</p>

<p>
The quarters taken up by troops on a march differ from those called standin=
g
cantonments in this way, that, in order to save the troops from unnecessary
marching, cantonments on a march are taken up as much as possible along the
lines of march, and are not at any considerable distance on either side of
these roads; if their extension in this sense does not exceed a short
day=E2=80=99s march, the arrangement is not one at all unfavourable to the =
quick
concentration of the army.
</p>

<p>
In all cases in presence of the enemy, according to the technical phrase in
use, that is in all cases where there is no considerable interval between t=
he
advance guards of the two armies respectively, the extent of the cantonment=
s
and the time required to assemble the army determine the strength and posit=
ion
of the advanced guard and outposts; but when these must be suited to the en=
emy
and circumstances, then, on the contrary, the extent of the cantonments mus=
t
depend on the time which we can count upon by the resistance of the advance
guard.
</p>

<p>
In the third(*) chapter of this book, we have stated how this resistance, i=
n the
case of an advanced corps, may be estimated. From the time of that resistan=
ce
we must deduct the time required for transmission of reports and getting th=
e
men under arms, and the remainder only is the time available for assembling=
 at
the point of concentration.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) 8th Chapter.=E2=80=94Tr.
</p>

<p>
We shall conclude here also by establishing our ideas in the form of a resu=
lt,
such as is usual under ordinary circumstances. If the distance at which the
advanced guard is detached is the same as the radius of the cantonments, an=
d
the point of assembly is fixed in the centre of the cantonments, the time w=
hich
is gained by checking the enemy=E2=80=99s advance would be available for th=
e
transmission of intelligence and getting under arms, and would in most case=
s be
sufficient, even although the communication is not made by means of signals=
,
cannon-shots, etc., but simply by relays of orderlies, the only really sure
method.
</p>

<p>
With an advanced guard pushed forward three miles in front, our cantonments
might therefore cover a space of thirty square miles. In a moderately-peopl=
ed
country there would be 10,000 houses in this space, which for an army of
50,000, after deducting the advanced guard, would be four men to a billet,
therefore very comfortable quarters; and for an army of twice the strength =
nine
men to a billet, therefore still not very close quarters. On the other hand=
, if
the advanced guard is only one mile in front, we could only occupy a space =
of
four square miles; for although the time gained does not diminish exactly i=
n
proportion as the distance of the advanced guard diminishes, and even with =
a
distance of one mile we may still calculate on a gain of six hours, yet the
necessity for caution increases when the enemy is so close. But in such a s=
pace
an army of 50,000 men could only find partial accommodation, even in a very
thickly populated country.
</p>

<p>
From all this we see what an important part is played here by great or at l=
east
considerable towns, which afford convenience for sheltering 10,000 or even
20,000 men almost at one point.
</p>

<p>
From this result it follows that, if we are not very close to the enemy, an=
d
have a suitable advanced guard we might remain in cantonments, even if the
enemy is concentrated, as Frederick the Great did at Breslau in the beginni=
ng
of the year 1762, and Buonaparte at Witebsk in 1812. But although by preser=
ving
a right distance and by suitable arrangements we have no reason to fear not
being able to assemble in time, even opposite an enemy who is concentrated,=
 yet
we must not forget that an army engaged in assembling itself in all haste c=
an
do nothing else in that time; that it is therefore, for a time at least, no=
t in
a condition to avail itself in an instant of fortuitous opportunities, whic=
h
deprives it of the greater part of its really efficient power. The conseque=
nce
of this is, that an army should only break itself up completely in cantonme=
nts
under some one or other of the three following cases:
</p>

<p>
1. If the enemy does the same.
</p>

<p>
2. If the condition of the troops makes it unavoidable.
</p>

<p>
3. If the more immediate object with the army is completely limited to the
maintenance of a strong position, and therefore the only point of importanc=
e is
concentrating the troops at that point in good time.
</p>

<p>
The campaign of 1815 gives a very remarkable example of the assembly of an =
army
from cantonments. General Ziethen, with Bl=C3=BCcher=E2=80=99s advanced gua=
rd, 30,000
men, was posted at Charleroi, only two miles from Sombreff, the place appoi=
nted
for the assembly of the army. The farthest cantonments of the army were abo=
ut
eight miles from Sombreff, that is, on the one side beyond Ciney, and on th=
e
other near Li=C3=A9ge. Notwithstanding this, the troops cantoned about Cine=
y were
assembled at Ligny several hours before the battle began, and those near Li=
=C3=A9ge
(Bulow=E2=80=99s Corps) would have been also, had it not been for accident =
and
faulty arrangements in the communication of orders and intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Unquestionably, proper care for the security of the Prussian army was not
taken; but in explanation we must say that the arrangements were made at a =
time
when the French army was still dispersed over widely extended cantonments, =
and
that the real fault consisted in not altering them the moment the first new=
s
was received that the enemy=E2=80=99s troops were in movement, and that
Buonaparte had joined the army.
</p>

<p>
Still it remains noteworthy that the Prussian army was able in any way to
concentrate at Sombreff before the attack of the enemy. Certainly, on the n=
ight
of the 14th, that is, twelve hours before Ziethen was actually attacked,
Bl=C3=BCcher received information of the advance of the enemy, and began to=
 assemble
his army; but on the 15th at nine in the morning, Ziethen was already hotly
engaged, and it was not until the same moment that General Thielman at Cine=
y
first received orders to march to Namur. He had therefore then to assemble =
his
divisions, and to march six and a half miles to Sombreff, which he did in 2=
4
hours. General Bulow would also have been able to arrive about the same tim=
e,
if the order had reached him as it should have done.
</p>

<p>
But Buonaparte did not resolve to make his attack on Ligny until two in the
afternoon of the 16th. The apprehension of having Wellington on the one sid=
e of
him, and Bl=C3=BCcher on the other, in other words, the disproportion in th=
e
relative forces, contributed to this slowness; still we see how the most
resolute commander may be detained by the cautious feeling of the way which=
 is
always unavoidable in cases which are to a certain degree complicated.
</p>

<p>
Some of the considerations here raised are plainly more tactical than strat=
egic
in their nature; but we have preferred rather to encroach a little than to =
run
the risk of not being sufficiently explicit.

<h3><a name=3D"chap60"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>Subsistence</h3>

<p>
This subject has acquired much greater importance in modern warfare from tw=
o
causes in particular. First, because the armies in general are now much gre=
ater
than those of the middle ages, and even those of the old world; for, althou=
gh
formerly armies did appear here and there which equalled or even surpassed
modern ones in size, still these were only rare and transient occurrences,
whilst in modern military history, since the time of Louis XIV, armies have
always been very strong in number. But the second cause is still more
important, and belongs entirely to modern times. It is the very much closer
inner connection which our wars have in themselves, the constant state of
readiness for battle of the belligerents engaged in carrying them on. Almos=
t
all old wars consist of single unconnected enterprises, which are separated
from each other by intervals during which the war in reality either complet=
ely
rested, and only still existed in a political sense, or when the armies at
least had removed so far from each other that each, without any care about =
the
army opposite, only occupied itself with its own wants.
</p>

<p>
Modern wars, that is, the wars which have taken place since the Peace of
Westphalia, have, through the efforts of respective governments, taken a mo=
re
systematic connected form; the military object, in general, predominates
everywhere, and demands also that arrangements for subsistence shall be on =
an
adequate scale. Certainly there were long periods of inaction in the wars o=
f
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, almost amounting to a cessation o=
f
war; these are the regular periods passed in cantonments; still even those
periods were subordinate to the military object; they were caused by the
inclemency of the season, not by any necessity arising out of the subsisten=
ce
of the troops, and as they regularly terminated with the return of summer,
therefore we may say at all events uninterrupted action was the rule of war
during the fine season of the year.
</p>

<p>
As the transition from one situation or method of action to another always
takes place gradually so it was in the case before us. In the wars against
Louis XIV. the allies used still to send their troops into winter cantonmen=
ts
in distant provinces in order to subsist them the more easily; in the Siles=
ian
war that was no longer done.
</p>

<p>
This systematic and connected form of carrying on war only became possible =
when
states took regular troops into their service in place of the feudal armies=
.
The obligation of the feudal law was then commuted into a fine or contribut=
ion:
personal service either came to an end, enlistment being substituted, or it=
 was
only continued amongst the lowest classes, as the nobility regarded the
furnishing a quota of men (as is still done in Russia and Hungary) as a kin=
d of
tribute, a tax in men. In every case, as we have elsewhere observed, armies
became henceforward, an instrument of the cabinet, their principal basis be=
ing
the treasury or the revenue of the government.
</p>

<p>
Just the same kind of thing which took place in the mode of raising and kee=
ping
up an establishment of troops could not but follow in the mode of subsistin=
g
them. The privileged classes having been released from the first of these
services on payment of a contribution in money, the expense of the latter c=
ould
not be again imposed on them quite so easily. The cabinet and the treasury =
had
therefore to provide for the subsistence of the army, and could not allow i=
t to
be maintained in its own country at the expense of the people. Administrati=
ons
were therefore obliged to look upon the subsistence of the army as an affai=
r
for which they were specially responsible. The subsistence thus became more
difficult in two ways: first, because it was an affair belonging to governm=
ent,
and next, because the forces required to be permanently embodied to confron=
t
those kept up in other states.
</p>

<p>
Thus arose a separate military class in the population, with an independent
organisation provided for its subsistence, and carried out to the utmost
possible perfection.
</p>

<p>
Not only were stores of provisions collected, either by purchase or by
deliveries in kind from the landed estates (Dominiallieferungen), consequen=
tly
from distant points, and lodged in magazines, but they were also forwarded =
from
these by means of special wagons, baked near the quarters of the troops in
ovens temporarily established, and from thence again carried away at last b=
y
the troops, by means of another system of transport attached to the army
itself. We take a glance at this system not merely from its being
characteristic of the military arrangements of the period, but also because=
 it
is a system which can never be entirely done away; some parts of it must
continually reappear.
</p>

<p>
Thus military organisation strove perpetually towards becoming more indepen=
dent
of people and country.
</p>

<p>
The consequence was that in this manner war became certainly a more systema=
tic
and more regular affair, and more subordinated to the military, that is the
political object; but it was at the same time also much straitened and impe=
ded
in its movement, and infinitely weakened in energy. For now an army was tie=
d to
its magazines, limited to the working powers of its transport service, and =
it
naturally followed that the tendency of everything was to economise the
subsistence of the troops. The soldier fed on a wretched pittance of bread,
moved about like a shadow, and no prospect of a change for the better comfo=
rted
him under his privations.
</p>

<p>
Whoever treats this miserable way of feeding soldiers as a matter of no mom=
ent,
and points to what Frederick the Great did with soldiers subsisted in this
manner, only takes a partial view of the matter. The power of enduring
privations is one of the finest virtues in a soldier, and without it no arm=
y is
animated with the true military spirit; but such privation must be of a
temporary kind, commanded by the force of circumstances, and not the
consequence of a wretchedly bad system, or of a parsimonious abstract
calculation of the smallest ration that a man can exist upon. When such is =
the
case the powers of the men individually will always deteriorate physically =
and
morally. What Frederick the Great managed to do with his soldiers cannot be
taken as a standard for us, partly because he was opposed to those who purs=
ued
a similar system, partly because we do not know how much more he might have
effected if he had been able to let his troops live as Buonaparte allowed h=
is
whenever circumstances permitted.
</p>

<p>
The feeding of horses by an artificial system of supply is, however, an
experiment which has not been tried, because forage is much more difficult =
to
provide on account of its bulk. A ration for a horse weighs about ten times=
 as
much as one for a man, and the number of horses with an army is more than
one-tenth the number of men, at present it is one-fourth to one-third, and
formerly it was one-third to one-half, therefore the weight of the forage
required is three, four, or five times as much as that of the soldier=E2=80=
=99s
rations required for the same period of time; on this account the shortest =
and
most direct means were taken to meet the wants of an army in this respect, =
that
is by foraging expeditions. Now these expeditions occasioned great
inconvenience in the conduct of war in other ways, first by making it a
principal object to keep the war in the enemy=E2=80=99s country; and next b=
ecause
they made it impossible to remain very long in one part of the country.
However, at the time of the Silesian war, foraging expeditions were much le=
ss
frequent, they were found to occasion a much greater drain upon the country=
,
and much greater waste than if the requirements were satisfied by means of
requisitions and imposts.
</p>

<p>
When the French Revolution suddenly brought again upon the war stage a nati=
onal
army, the means which governments could command were found insufficient, an=
d
the whole system of war, which had its origin in the limited extent of thes=
e
means, and found again its security in this limitation, fell to pieces, and=
 of
course in the downfall of the whole was included that of the branch of whic=
h we
are now speaking, the system of subsistence. Without troubling themselves a=
bout
magazines, and still less about such an organisation as the artificial
clockwork of which we have spoken, by which the different divisions of the
transport service went round like a wheel, the leading spirits of the
revolution sent their soldiers into the field, forced their generals to fig=
ht,
subsisted, reinforced their armies, and kept alive the war by a system of
exaction, and of helping themselves to all they required by robbery and
plunder.
</p>

<p>
Between these two extremes the war under Buonaparte, and against him, prese=
rved
a sort of medium, that is to say, it just made use of such means as suited =
it
best amongst all that were available; and so it will be also in future.
</p>

<p>
The modern method of subsisting troops, that is, seizing every thing which =
is
to be found in the country without regard to <i>meum et tuum</i> may be car=
ried
out in four different ways: that is, subsisting on the inhabitant,
contributions which the troops themselves look after, general contributions=
 and
magazines. All four are generally applied together, one generally prevailin=
g
more than the others: still it sometimes happens that only one is applied
entirely by itself.
</p>

<h4>
1.=E2=80=94Living on the inhabitants, or on the community, which is the sam=
e
thing.
</h4>

<p>
If we bear in mind that in a community consisting even as it does in great
towns, of consumers only, there must always be provisions enough to last fo=
r
several days, we may easily see that the most densely populated place can
furnish food and quarters for a day for about as many troops as there are
inhabitants, and for a less number of troops for several days without the
necessity of any particular previous preparation. In towns of considerable =
size
this gives a very satisfactory result, because it enables us to subsist a l=
arge
force at one point. But in smaller towns, or even in villages, the supply w=
ould
be far from sufficient; for a population of 3,000 or 4,000 in a square mile
which would be large in such a space, would only suffice to feed 3,000 or 4=
,000
soldiers, and if the whole mass of troops is great they would have to be sp=
read
over such an extent of country at this rate as would hardly be consistent w=
ith
other essential points. But in level countries, and even in small towns, th=
e
quantity of those kinds of provisions which are essential in war is general=
ly
much greater; the supply of bread which a peasant has is generally adequate=
 to
the consumption of his family for several, perhaps from eight to fourteen d=
ays;
meat can be obtained daily, vegetable productions are generally forthcoming=
 in
sufficient quantity to last till the following crop. Therefore in quarters
which have never been occupied there is no difficulty in subsisting troops
three or four times the number of the inhabitants for several days, which a=
gain
is a very satisfactory result. According to this, where the population is a=
bout
2,000 or 3,000 per square mile, and if no large town is included, a column =
of
30,000 would require about four square miles, which would be a length of si=
de
of two miles. Therefore for an army of 90,000, which we may reckon at about
75,000 combatants, if marching in three columns contiguous to each other, w=
e
should require to take up a front six miles in breadth in case three roads
could be found within that breadth.
</p>

<p>
If several columns follow one another into these cantonments, then special
measures must be adopted by the civil authorities, and in that way there ca=
n be
no great difficulty in obtaining all that is required for a day or two more=
.
Therefore if the above 90,000 are followed the day after by a like number, =
even
these last would suffer no want; this makes up the large number of 150,000
combatants.
</p>

<p>
Forage for the horses occasions still less difficulty, as it neither requir=
es
grinding nor baking, and as there must be forage forthcoming in sufficient
quantity to last the horses in the country until next harvest, therefore ev=
en
where there is little stall-feeding, still there should be no want, only th=
e
deliveries of forage should certainly be demanded from the community at lar=
ge,
not from the inhabitants individually. Besides, it is supposed that some
attention is, of course, paid to the nature of the country in making
arrangements for a march, so as not to send cavalry mostly into places of
commerce and manufactures, and into districts where there is no forage.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion to be drawn from this hasty glance is, therefore, that in a
moderately populated country, that is, a country of from 2,000 to 3,000 sou=
ls
per square mile, an army of 150,000 combatants may be subsisted by the
inhabitants and community for one or two days within such a narrow space as
will not interfere with its concentration for battle, that is, therefore, t=
hat
such an army can be subsisted on a continuous march without magazines or ot=
her
preparation.
</p>

<p>
On this result were based the enterprises of the French army in the
revolutionary war, and under Buonaparte. They marched from the Adige to the
Lower Danube, and from the Rhine to the Vistula, with little means of
subsistence except upon the inhabitants, and without ever suffering want. A=
s
their undertakings depended on moral and physical superiority, as they were
attended with certain results, and were never delayed by indecision or caut=
ion,
therefore their progress in the career of victory was generally that of an
uninterrupted march.
</p>

<p>
If circumstances are less favourable, if the population is not so great, or=
 if
it consists more of artisans than agriculturists, if the soil is bad, the
country already several times overrun=E2=80=94then of course the results wi=
ll
fall short of what we have supposed. Still, we must remember that if the
breadth of the front of a column is extended from two miles to three, we ge=
t a
superficial extent of country more than double in size, that is, instead of
four we command nine square miles, and that this is still an extent which i=
n
ordinary cases will always admit of concentration for action; we see theref=
ore
that even under unfavourable circumstances this method of subsistence will
still be always compatible with a continuous march.
</p>

<p>
But if a halt of several days takes place, then great distress must ensue i=
f
preparations have not been made beforehand for such an event in other ways.=
 Now
these preparatory measures are of two kinds, and without them a considerabl=
e
army even now cannot exist. The first is equipping the troops with a wagon
train, by means of which bread or flour, as the most essential part of thei=
r
subsistence, can be carried with them for a few, that is, for three or four
days; if to this we add three or four days=E2=80=99 rations which the soldi=
er
himself can carry, then we have provided what is most indispensable in the =
way
of subsistence for eight days.
</p>

<p>
The second arrangement is that of a regular commissariat, which whenever th=
ere
is a moment=E2=80=99s halt gathers provisions from distant localities, so t=
hat at
any moment we can pass over from the system of quartering on the inhabitant=
s to
a different system.
</p>

<p>
Subsisting in cantonments has the immense advantage that hardly any transpo=
rt
is required, and that it is done in the shortest time, but certainly it
supposes as a prior condition that cantonments can be provided for all the
troops.
</p>

<h4>
2.=E2=80=94Subsistence through exactions enforced by the troops themselves.
</h4>

<p>
If a single battalion occupies a camp, this camp may be placed in the vicin=
ity
of some villages, and these may receive notice to furnish subsistence; then=
 the
method of subsistence would not differ essentially from the preceding mode.
But, as is most usual, if the mass of troops to be encamped at some one poi=
nt
is much larger, there is no alternative but to make a collection in common
within the circle of districts marked out for the purpose, collecting
sufficient for the supply of one of the parts of the army, a brigade or
division, and afterwards to make a distribution from the common stock thus
collected.
</p>

<p>
The first glance shows that by such a mode of proceeding the subsistence of=
 a
large army would be a matter of impossibility. The collection made from the
stores in any given district in the country will be much less than if the
troops had taken up their quarters in the same district, for when thirty or
forty men take possession of a farmer=E2=80=99s house they can if necessary
collect the last mouthful, but one officer sent with a few men to collect
provisions has neither time nor means to hunt out all the provisions that m=
ay
be stored in a house, often also he has not the means of transport; he will
therefore only be able to collect a small proportion of what is actually
forthcoming. Besides, in camps the troops are crowded together in such a ma=
nner
at one point, that the range of country from which provisions can be collec=
ted
in a hurry is not of sufficient extent to furnish the whole of what is
required. What could be done in the way of supplying 30,000 men, within a
circle of a mile in diameter, or from an area of three or four square miles=
?
Moreover it would seldom be possible to collect even what there is, for the
most of the nearest adjacent villages would be occupied by small bodies of
troops, who would not allow anything to be removed. Lastly, by such a measu=
re
there would be the greatest waste, because some men would get more than the=
y
required, whilst a great deal would be lost, and of no benefit to any one.
</p>

<p>
The result is, therefore, that the subsistence of troops by forced
contributions in this manner can only be adopted with success when the bodi=
es
of troops are not too large, not exceeding a division of 8,000 or 10,000 me=
n,
and even then it is only to be resorted to as an unavoidable evil.
</p>

<p>
It cannot in general be avoided in the case of troops directly in front of =
the
enemy, such as advanced guards and outposts, when the army is advancing,
because these bodies must arrive at points where no preparations could have
been made, and they are usually too far from the stores collected for the r=
est
of the army; further, in the case of moveable columns acting independently;=
 and
lastly, in all cases where by chance there is neither time nor means to pro=
cure
subsistence in any other way.
</p>

<p>
The more troops are accustomed to live by regular requisitions, the more ti=
me
and circumstances permit the adoption of that way of subsisting, then the m=
ore
satisfactory will be the result. But time is generally wanting, for what th=
e
troops get for themselves directly is got much quicker.
</p>

<h4>
3.=E2=80=94By regular requisitions.
</h4>

<p>
This is unquestionably the simplest and most efficacious means of subsistin=
g
troops, and it has been the basis of all modern wars.
</p>

<p>
It differs from the preceding way chiefly by its having the co-operation of=
 the
local authorities. The supply in this case must not be carried off forcibly
just from the spot where it is found, but be regularly delivered according =
to
an equitable division of the burden. This division can only be made by the
recognised official authorities of the country.
</p>

<p>
In this all depends on time. The more time there is, the more general can t=
he
division be made, the less will it press on individuals, and the more regul=
ar
will be the result. Even purchases may be made with ready money to assist, =
in
which way it will approach the mode which follows next in order (Magazines)=
. In
all assemblages of troops in their own country there is no difficulty in
subsisting by regular requisitions; neither, as a rule, is there any in
retrograde movements. On the other hand, in all movements into a country of
which we are not in possession, there is very little time for such
arrangements, seldom more than the one day which the advanced guard is in t=
he
habit of preceding the army. With the advanced guard the requisitions are s=
ent
to the local officials, specifying how many rations they are to have ready =
at
such and such places. As these can only be furnished from the immediate
neighbourhood, that is, within a circuit of a couple of miles round each po=
int,
the collections so made in haste will never be nearly sufficient for an arm=
y of
considerable strength, and consequently, if the troops do not carry with th=
em
enough for several days, they will run short. It is therefore the duty of t=
he
commissariat to economise what is received, and only to issue to those troo=
ps
who have nothing. With each succeeding day, however, the embarrassment
diminishes; that is to say, if the distances from which provisions can be
procured increase in proportion to the number of days, then the superficial
area over which the contributions can be levied increases as the squares of=
 the
distances gained. If on the first day only four square miles have been draw=
n
upon, on the next day we shall have sixteen, on the third, thirty-six;
therefore on the second day twelve more than on the first, and on the third=
 day
twenty more than on the second.
</p>

<p>
Of course this is a mere rough estimate of what may take place, subject to =
many
modifying circumstances which may intervene, of which the principal is, tha=
t
one district may not be capable of contributing like another. But on the ot=
her
hand, we must also remember that the radius within which we can levy may
increase more than two miles a day in width, perhaps three or four, or in m=
any
places still more.
</p>

<p>
The due execution of these requisitions is enforced by detachments placed u=
nder
the orders of the official functionaries, but still more by the fear of
responsibility, punishment, and ill-treatment which, in such cases, like a
general weight, presses on the whole population.
</p>

<p>
However, it is not our intention to enter into details=E2=80=94into the who=
le
machinery of commissariat and army subsistence; we have only results in vie=
w.
</p>

<p>
The result to be derived from a common-sense view of all the circumstances =
in
general, and the view which the experience of the wars since the French
revolution tends to confirm is,=E2=80=94that even the largest army, if it c=
arries
with it provisions for a few days, may undoubtedly be subsisted by
contributions which, commencing at the moment of entering a country, affect=
 at
first only the districts in the immediate vicinity of the army, but afterwa=
rds,
in the course of time, are levied on a greater scale, over a range of count=
ry
always increasing, and with an ever increasing weight of authority.
</p>

<p>
This resource has no limits except those of the exhaustion, impoverishment,=
 and
devastation of the country. When the stay of an invading army is of some
duration, the administration of this system at last is handed over to those=
 in
the highest official capacity; and they naturally do all they can to equali=
se
its pressure as much as possible, and to alleviate the weight of the tax by
purchases; at the same time, even an invader, when his stay is prolonged in=
 his
enemy=E2=80=99s country, is not usually so barbarous and reckless as to lay=
 upon
that country the entire burden of his support; thus the system of contribut=
ions
of itself gradually approaches to that of magazines, at the same time witho=
ut
ever ceasing altogether, or sensibly losing any of that influence which it
exercises on the operations of the war; for there is a wide difference betw=
een
a case in which some of the resources which have been drawn from a country =
are
replaced by supplies brought from more distant parts (the country, however,
still remaining substantially the source on which the army depends for its
supplies), and the case of an army which=E2=80=94as in the eighteenth
century=E2=80=94provides for all its wants from its own resources, the coun=
try in
which it is operating contributing, as a rule, nothing towards its support.
</p>

<p>
The great difference consists in two things,=E2=80=94namely, the employment=
 of
the transport of the country, and its ovens. In this way, that enormous bur=
den
of any army, that incubus which is always destroying its own work, a milita=
ry
transport train, is almost got rid of.
</p>

<p>
It is true that even now no army can do entirely without some subsistence
wagons, but the number is immensely diminished, and little more is required
than sufficient to carry the surplus of one day on till the next. Peculiar
circumstances, as in Russia in 1812, may even again compel an army to carry=
 an
enormous train, and also field-ovens; but in the first place these are
exceptional cases; for how seldom will it happen that 300,000 men make a
hostile advance of 130 miles upon almost a single road, and that through
countries such as Poland and Russia, and shortly before the season of harve=
st;
and in the next place, any means of supply attached to an army in such case=
s,
may be looked upon as only an assistance in case of need, the contributions=
 of
the country being always regarded as the groundwork of the whole system of
supply.
</p>

<p>
Since the first campaigns of the French revolutionary war, the requisition
system has formed constantly the mainstay of their armies, the armies oppos=
ed
to them were also obliged to adopt the same system, and it is not at all li=
kely
that it will ever be abandoned. There is no other which can be substituted =
for
it with the same results, both as regards its simplicity and freedom from
restraint, and also as respects energy in the prosecution of the war. As an
army is seldom distressed for provisions during the first three or four wee=
ks
of a campaign whatever direction it takes, and afterwards can be assisted b=
y
magazines, we may very well say that by this method war has acquired the mo=
st
perfect freedom of action. Certainly difficulties may be greater in one
direction than in another, and that may carry weight in preliminary
deliberation; but we can never encounter an absolute impossibility, and the
attention which is due to the subject of subsistence can never decide a
question imperatively. To this there is only one exception, which is a retr=
eat
through an enemy=E2=80=99s country. In such a case many of the inconvenienc=
es
connected with subsistence meet together. The operation is one of a continu=
ous
nature, generally carried on without a halt worth speaking of; there is,
therefore, no time to procure provisions; the circumstances under which the
operation commences are generally unfavourable, it is therefore necessary t=
o
keep the troops in masses, and a dispersion in cantonments, or even any
considerable extension in the width of the column cannot be allowed; the
hostile feeling of the country precludes the chance of any collection of
contributions by mere orders issued without the support of a force capable =
of
executing the order; and, lastly, the moment is most auspicious for the
inhabitants to give vent to their feelings by acts of hostility. On account=
 of
all this, an army so situated is generally obliged to confine itself strict=
ly
to its previously prepared lines of communication and retreat.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte had to retreat in 1812, it was impossible for him to do so =
by
any other line but the one upon which he had advanced, on account of the
subsistence of his army; and if he had attempted any other he would only ha=
ve
plunged into more speedy and certain destruction; all the censure therefore
passed on him by even French writers as well as by others with regard to th=
is
point is sheer nonsense.
</p>

<h4>
4.=E2=80=94Subsistence from Magazines.
</h4>

<p>
If we are to make a generic distinction between this method of subsisting
troops and the preceding, it must be by an organisation such as existed for
about thirty years at the close of the seventeenth and during the eighteent=
h
century. Can this organisation ever reappear?
</p>

<p>
Certainly we cannot conceive how it can be dispensed with if great armies a=
re
to be bound down for seven, ten, or twelve years long to one spot, as they =
have
been formerly in the Netherlands, on the Rhine, in Upper Italy, Silesia, an=
d
Saxony; for what country can continue for such a length of time to endure t=
he
burden of two great armies, making it the entire source of their supplies,
without being utterly ruined in the end, and therefore gradually becoming
unable to meet the demands?
</p>

<p>
But here naturally arises the question: shall the war prescribe the system =
of
subsistence, or shall the latter dictate the nature of the war? To this we
answer: the system of subsistence will control the war, in the first place,=
 as
far as the other conditions on which it depends permit; but when the latter=
 are
encroached upon, the war will react on the subsistence system, and in such =
case
determine the same.
</p>

<p>
A war carried on by means of the system of requisitions and local supplies
furnished on the spot has such an advantage over one carried on in dependen=
ce
on issues from magazines, that the latter does not look at all like the sam=
e
instrument. No state will therefore venture to encounter the former with th=
e
latter; and if any war minister should be so narrow-minded and blind to
circumstances as to ignore the real relation which the two systems bear to =
each
other, by sending an army into the field to live upon the old system, the f=
orce
of circumstances would carry the commander of that army along with it in it=
s
course, and the requisition system would burst forth of itself. If we consi=
der
besides, that the great expense attending such an organisation must necessa=
rily
reduce the extent of the armament in other respects, including of course th=
e
actual number of combatant soldiers, as no state has a superabundance of
wealth, then there seems no probability of any such organisation being agai=
n
resorted to unless it should be adopted by the belligerents by mutual
agreement, an idea which is a mere play of the imagination.
</p>

<p>
Wars therefore may be expected henceforward always to commence with the
requisition system; how much one or other government will do to supplement =
the
same by an artificial organisation to spare their own country, etc., etc.,
remains to be seen; that it will not be overmuch we may be certain, for at =
such
moments the tendency is to look to the most urgent wants, and an artificial
system of subsisting troops does not come under that category.
</p>

<p>
But now, if a war is not so decisive in its results, if its operations are =
not
so comprehensive as is consistent with its real nature, then the requisitio=
n
system will begin to exhaust the country in which it is carried on to that
degree that either peace must be made, or means must be found to lighten th=
e
burden on the country, and to become independent of it for the supplies of =
the
army. The latter was the case of the French army under Buonaparte in Spain,=
 but
the first happens much more frequently. In most wars the exhaustion of the
state increases to that degree that, instead of thinking of prosecuting the=
 war
at a still greater expense, the necessity for peace becomes so urgent as to=
 be
imperative. Thus from this point of view the modern method of carrying on w=
ar
has a tendency to shorten the duration of wars.
</p>

<p>
At the same time we shall not positively deny the possibility of the old sy=
stem
of subsistence reappearing in future wars; it will perhaps be resorted to b=
y
belligerents hereafter, where the nature of their mutual relations urge the=
m to
it, and circumstances are favourable to its adoption; but we can never perc=
eive
in that system a natural organisation; it is much rather an abnormal growth
permitted by circumstances, but which can never spring from war in its true
sense. Still less can we consider that form or system as any improvement in=
 war
on the ground of its being more humane, for war itself is not a humane
proceeding.
</p>

<p>
Whatever method of providing subsistence may be chosen, it is but natural t=
hat
it should be more easily carried out in rich and well-peopled countries, th=
an
in the midst of a poor and scanty population. That the population should be
taken into consideration, lies in the double relation which that element be=
ars
to the quantity of provisions to be found in a country: first because, wher=
e
the consumption is large, the provision to meet that consumption is also la=
rge;
and in the next place, because as a rule a large population produces also
largely. From this we must certainly except districts peopled chiefly by
manufacturers, particularly when, as is often the case, such districts lie =
in
mountain valleys surrounded by unproductive land; but in the generality of
cases it is always very much easier to feed troops in a well populated than=
 in
a thinly inhabited country. An army of 100,000 men cannot be supported on f=
our
hundred square miles inhabited by 400,000 people, as well as it would be on
four hundred square miles with a population of 2,000,000 inhabitants, even
supposing the soil equally good in the two cases. Besides, the roads and me=
ans
of water-carriage are much better in rich countries and afford a greater
choice, being more numerous, the means of transport are more abundant, the
commercial relations easier and more certain. In a word, there is infinitel=
y
less difficulty in supporting an army in Flanders than in Poland.
</p>

<p>
The consequence is, that war with its manifold suckers fixes itself by
preference along high roads, near populous towns, in the fertile valleys of
large rivers, or along such sea-coasts as are well frequented.
</p>

<p>
This shows clearly how the subsistence of troops may have a general influen=
ce
upon the direction and form of military undertakings, and upon the choice o=
f a
theatre of war and lines of communication.
</p>

<p>
The extent of this influence, what weight shall attach to the facility or
difficulty of provisioning the troops, all that in the calculation depends =
very
much on the way in which the war is to be conducted. If it is to be carried=
 on
in its real spirit, that is, with the unbridled force which belongs to its
element, with a constant pressing forward to, or seeking for the combat and
decisive solution, then the sustenance of the troops although an important,=
 is
but a subordinate, affair; but if there is to be a state of equilibrium dur=
ing
which the armies move about here and there in the same province for several
years, then the subsistence must often become the principal thing, the
intendant the commander-in-chief, and the conduct of the war an administrat=
ion
of wagons.
</p>

<p>
There are numberless campaigns of this kind in which nothing took place; th=
e
plans miscarried, the forces were used to no purpose, the only excuse being=
 the
plea of a want of subsistence; on the other hand Buonaparte used to say
=E2=80=9C<i>Qu=E2=80=99on ne me parle pas des vivres!</i>=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
Certainly that general in the Russian campaign proved that such recklessnes=
s
may be carried too far, for not to say that perhaps his whole campaign was
ruined through that cause alone, which at best would be only a supposition,
still it is beyond doubt that to his want of regard to the subsistence of h=
is
troops he was indebted for the extraordinary melting away of his army on hi=
s
advance, and for its utter ruin on the retreat.
</p>

<p>
But while fully recognising in Buonaparte the eager gambler who ventures on
many a mad extreme, we may justly say that he and the revolutionary general=
s
who preceded him dispelled a powerful prejudice in respect to the subsisten=
ce
of troops, and showed that it should never be looked upon in any other ligh=
t
than as a <i>condition</i> of war, never as an object.
</p>

<p>
Besides, it is with privation in war just as with physical exertion and dan=
ger;
the demands which the general can make on his army are without any defined
bounds; an iron character demands more than a feeble sensitive man; also th=
e
endurance of an army differs in degree, according as habit, military spirit=
,
confidence in and affection towards the commander, or enthusiasm for the ca=
use
of fatherland, sustain the will and energy of the soldier. But this we may =
look
upon as an established principle, that privation and want, however far they=
 may
be carried, should never be otherwise regarded than as transition-states wh=
ich
should be succeeded by a state of abundance, indeed even by superfluity. Ca=
n
there be any thing more touching than the thought of so many thousand soldi=
ers,
badly clothed, with packs on their backs weighing thirty or forty pounds,
toiling over every kind of road, in every description of weather, for days =
and
days continually on the march, health and life for ever in peril, and for a=
ll
that unable to get a sufficiency of dry bread. Any one who knows how often =
this
happens in war, is at a loss to know how it does not oftener lead to a refu=
sal
of the will and powers to submit any longer to such exactions, and how the =
mere
bent constantly given to the imagination of human beings in one direction, =
is
capable of first calling forth, and then supporting such incredible efforts=
.
</p>

<p>
Let any one then, who imposes great privations on his men because great obj=
ects
demand such a trial of endurance, always bear in mind as a matter of pruden=
ce,
if not prompted to it by his own feelings, that there is a recompence for s=
uch
sacrifices which he is bound to pay at some other time.
</p>

<p>
We have now to consider the difference which takes place in respect to the
question of subsistence in war, according as the action is offensive or
defensive.
</p>

<p>
The defensive is in a position to make uninterrupted use of the subsistence
which he has been able to lay in beforehand, as long as his defensive act
continues. The defensive side therefore can hardly be in want of the
necessaries of life, particularly if he is in his own country; but even in =
the
enemy=E2=80=99s this holds good. The offensive on the other hand is moving =
away
from his resources, and as long as he is advancing, and even during the fir=
st
weeks after he stops, must procure from day to day what he requires, and th=
is
can very rarely be done without want and inconvenience being felt.
</p>

<p>
This difficulty is felt in its fullest force at two particular periods, fir=
st
in the advance, before the decision takes place; then the supplies of the
defensive side are all at hand, whilst the assailant has been obliged to le=
ave
his behind; he is obliged to keep his masses concentrated, and therefore ca=
nnot
spread his army over any considerable space; even his transport cannot keep
close to him when he commences his movements preliminary to a battle. If hi=
s
preparations have not been very well made, it may easily happen at this mom=
ent
that his army may be in want of supplies for several days before the decisi=
ve
battle, which certainly is not a means of bringing them into the fight in t=
he
highest state of efficiency.
</p>

<p>
The second time a state of want arises is at the end of a victorious career=
, if
the lines of communication begin to be too long, especially if the war is
carried on in a poor, sparsely-populated country, and perhaps also in the m=
idst
of a people whose feelings are hostile. What an enormous difference between=
 a
line of communication from Wilna to Moscow, on which every carriage must be
forcibly seized, and a line from Cologne by Li=C3=A9ge, Louvain, Brussels, =
Mons, and
Valenciennes to Paris, where a mercantile contract or a bill of exchange wo=
uld
suffice to procure millions of rations.
</p>

<p>
Frequently has the difficulty we are now speaking of resulted in obscuring =
the
splendour of the most brilliant victories, reduced the powers of the victor=
ious
army, rendered retreat necessary, and then by degrees ended in producing al=
l
the symptoms of a real defeat.
</p>

<p>
Forage, of which, as we have before said, there is usually at first the lea=
st
deficiency, will run short soonest if a country begins to become exhausted,=
 for
it is the most difficult supply to procure from a distance, on account of i=
ts
bulk, and the horse feels the effect of low feeding much sooner than the ma=
n.
For this reason, an over-numerous cavalry and artillery may become a real
burden, and an element of weakness to an army.

<h3><a name=3D"chap61"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>Base of Operations</h3>

<p>
If an army sets out on any expedition, whether it be to attack the enemy an=
d
his theatre of war, or to take post on its own frontier, it continues in a
state of necessary dependence on the sources from which it draws its
subsistence and reinforcements, and must maintain its communication with th=
em,
as they are the conditions of its existence and preservation. This dependen=
ce
increases in intensity and extent in proportion to the size of the army. Bu=
t
now it is neither always possible nor requisite that the army should contin=
ue
in direct communication with the whole of its own country; it is sufficient=
 if
it does so with that portion immediately in its rear, and which is conseque=
ntly
covered by its position. In this portion of the country then, as far as
necessary, special dep=C3=B4ts of provisions are formed, and arrangements a=
re made
for regularly forwarding reinforcements and supplies. This strip of territo=
ry
is therefore the foundation of the army and of all its undertakings, and th=
e
two must be regarded as forming in connection only one whole. If the suppli=
es
for their greater security are lodged in fortified places, the idea of a ba=
se
becomes more distinct; but the idea does not originate in any arrangement o=
f
that kind, and in a number of cases no such arrangement is made.
</p>

<p>
But a portion of the enemy=E2=80=99s territory may also become a base for o=
ur
army, or, at least, form part of it; for when an army penetrates into an
enemy=E2=80=99s land, a number of its wants are supplied from that part of =
the
country which is taken possession of; but it is then a necessary condition =
that
we are completely masters of this portion of territory, that is, certain of=
 our
orders being obeyed within its limits. This certainty, however, seldom exte=
nds
beyond the reach of our ability to keep the inhabitants in awe by small
garrisons, and detachments moving about from place to place, and that is no=
t
very far in general. The consequence is, that in the enemy=E2=80=99s countr=
y, the
part of territory from which we can draw supplies is seldom of sufficient
extent to furnish all the supplies we require, and we must therefore still
depend on our own land for much, and this brings us back again to the
importance of that part of our territory immediately in rear of our army as=
 an
indispensable portion of our base.
</p>

<p>
The wants of an army may be divided into two classes, first those which eve=
ry
cultivated country can furnish; and next those which can only be obtained f=
rom
those localities where they are produced. The first are chiefly provisions,=
 the
second the means of keeping an army complete in every way. The first can
therefore be obtained in the enemy=E2=80=99s country; the second, as a rule=
, can
only be furnished by our own country, for example men, arms, and almost all
munitions of war. Although there are exceptions to this classification in
certain cases, still they are few and trifling, and the distinction we have
drawn is of standing importance, and proves again that the communication wi=
th
our own country is indispensable.
</p>

<p>
Dep=C3=B4ts of provisions and forage are generally formed in open towns, bo=
th in the
enemy=E2=80=99s and in our own country, because there are not as many fortr=
esses
as would be required for these bulky stores continually being consumed, and
wanted sometimes here, sometimes there, and also because their loss is much
easier to replace; on the other hand, stores to keep the army complete, suc=
h as
arms, munition of war, and articles of equipment are never lodged in open
places in the vicinity of the theatre of war if it can be avoided, but are
rather brought from a distance, and in the enemy=E2=80=99s country never st=
ored
anywhere but in fortresses. From this point, again, it may be inferred that=
 the
base is of more importance in relation to supplies intended to refit an arm=
y
than in relation to provisions for food.
</p>

<p>
Now, the more means of each kind are collected together in great magazines
before being brought into use, the more, therefore, all separate streams un=
ite
in great reservoirs, so much the more may these be regarded as taking the p=
lace
of the whole country, and so much the more will the conception of a base fi=
x
itself upon these great dep=C3=B4ts of supply; but this must never go so fa=
r that
any such place becomes looked upon as constituting a base in itself alone.
</p>

<p>
If these sources of supply and refitment are abundant, that is, if the trac=
ts
of territory are wide and rich, if the stores are collected in great dep=C3=
=B4ts to
be more speedily brought into use, if these dep=C3=B4ts are covered in a mi=
litary
sense in one way or another, if they are in close proximity to the army and
accessible by good roads, if they extend along a considerable width in the =
rear
of the army or surround it in part as well=E2=80=94then follows a greater
vitality for the army, as well as a greater freedom in its movements. Attem=
pts
have been made to sum up all the advantages which an army derives from bein=
g so
situated in one single conception, that is, the extent of the base of
operations. By the relation which this base bears to the object of the
undertakings, by the angle which its extremities make with this object
(supposed as a point), it has been attempted to express the whole sum of th=
e
advantages and disadvantages which accrue to an army from the position and
nature of its sources of supply and equipment; but it is plain this elegant
piece of geometrical refinement is merely a play of fancy, as it is founded=
 on
a series of substitutions which must all be made at the expense of truth. A=
s we
have seen, the base of an army is a triple formation in connection with the
situation in which an army is placed: the resources of the country adjacent=
 to
the position of the army, the dep=C3=B4ts of stores which have been made at
particular points, and the <i>province</i> from which these stores are deri=
ved
or collected. These three things are separated in space, and cannot be
collected into one whole, and least of all can we substitute for them a lin=
e
which is to represent the width of the base, a line which is generally imag=
ined
in a manner perfectly arbitrary, either from one fortress to another or fro=
m
one capital of a province to another, or along a political boundary of a
country. Neither can we determine precisely the mutual relation of these th=
ree
steps in the formation of a base, for in reality they blend themselves with
each other always more or less. In one case the surrounding country affords
largely the means of refitting an army with things which otherwise could on=
ly
be obtained from a long distance; in another case we are obliged to get eve=
n
food from a long distance. Sometimes the nearest fortresses are great arsen=
als,
ports, or commercial cities, which contain all the military resources of a
whole state, sometimes they are nothing but old, feeble ramparts, hardly
sufficient for their own defence.
</p>

<p>
The consequence is that all deductions from the length of the base of
operations and its angles, and the whole theory of war founded on these dat=
a,
as far as its geometrical phase, have never met with any attention in real =
war,
and in theory they have only caused wrong tendencies. But as the basis of t=
his
chain of reasoning is a truth, and only the conclusions drawn are false, th=
is
same view will easily and frequently thrust itself forward again.
</p>

<p>
We think, therefore, that we cannot go beyond acknowledging generally the
influence of a base on military enterprises, that at the same time there ar=
e no
means of framing out of this maxim any serviceable rules by a few abstract
ideas; but that in each separate case the whole of the things which we have
specified must be <i>kept in view together</i>.
</p>

<p>
When once arrangements are made within a certain radius to provide the mean=
s of
subsisting an army and keeping it complete in every respect, and with a vie=
w to
operations in a certain direction, then, even in our own country, this dist=
rict
only is to be regarded as the base of the army; and as any alteration of a =
base
requires time and labour, therefore an army cannot change its base every da=
y,
even in its own country, and this again limits it always more or less in th=
e
direction of its operations. If, then, in operating against an enemy=E2=80=
=99s
country we take the whole line of our own frontier, where it forms a bounda=
ry
between the two countries as our base, we may do so in a general sense, in =
so
far that we might make those preparations which constitute a base anywhere =
on
that frontier; but it will not be a base at any moment if preparations have=
 not
been already made everywhere. When the Russian army retreated before the Fr=
ench
in 1812, at the beginning of the campaign the whole of Russia might have be=
en
considered as its base, the more so because the vast extent of the country
offered the army abundance of space in any direction it might select. This =
is
no illusory notion, as it was actually realised at a subsequent time, when
other Russian armies from different quarters entered the field; but still a=
t
every period throughout the campaign the base of the Russian army was not s=
o
extensive; it was principally confined to the road on which the whole train=
 of
transport to and from their army was organised. This limitation prevented t=
he
Russian army, for instance, from making the further retreat which became
necessary after the three days=E2=80=99 fighting at Smolensk in any directi=
on but
that of Moscow, and so hindered their turning suddenly in the direction of
Kaluga, as was proposed in order to draw the enemy away from Moscow. Such a
change of direction could only have been possible by having been prepared f=
or
long beforehand.
</p>

<p>
We have said that the dependence on the base increases in intensity and ext=
ent
with the size of the army, which is easy to understand. An army is like a t=
ree.
From the ground out of which it grows it draws its nourishment; if it is sm=
all
it can easily be transplanted, but this becomes more difficult as it increa=
ses
in size. A small body of troops has also its channels, from which it draws =
the
sustenance of life, but it strikes root easily where it happens to be; not =
so a
large army. When, therefore, we talk of the influence of the base on the
operations of an army, the dimensions of the army must always serve as the
scale by which to measure the magnitude of that influence.
</p>

<p>
Further it is consistent with the nature of things that for the immediate w=
ants
of the present hour the <i>subsistence</i> is the main point, but for the
general efficiency of the army through a long period of time the
<i>refitment</i> and <i>recruitment</i> are the more important, because the
latter can only be done from particular sources while the former may be
obtained in many ways; this again defines still more distinctly the influen=
ce
of the base on the operations of the army.
</p>

<p>
However great that influence may be, we must never forget that it belongs t=
o
those things which can only show a decisive effect after some considerable
time, and that therefore the question always remains what may happen in tha=
t
time. The value of a base of operations will seldom determine the choice of=
 an
undertaking in the first instance. Mere difficulties which may present
themselves in this respect must be put side by side and compared with other
means actually at our command; obstacles of this nature often vanish before=
 the
force of decisive victories.

<h3><a name=3D"chap62"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br>Lines of Communication</h3>

<p>
The roads which lead from the position of an army to those points in its re=
ar
where its dep=C3=B4ts of supply and means of recruiting and refitting its f=
orces are
principally united, and which it also in all ordinary cases chooses for its
retreat, have a double signification; in the first place, they are its <i>l=
ines
of communication</i> for the constant nourishment of the combatant force, a=
nd
next they are <i>roads of retreat</i>.
</p>

<p>
We have said in the preceding chapter, that, although according to the pres=
ent
system of subsistence, an army is chiefly fed from the district in which it=
 is
operating, it must still be looked upon as forming a whole with its base. T=
he
lines of communication belong to this whole; they form the connection betwe=
en
the army and its base, and are to be considered as so many great vital
arteries. Supplies of every kind, convoys of munitions, detachments moving
backwards and forwards, posts, orderlies, hospitals, dep=C3=B4ts, reserves =
of
stores, agents of administration, all these objects are constantly making u=
se
of these roads, and the total value of these services is of the utmost
importance to the army.
</p>

<p>
These great channels of life must therefore neither be permanently severed,=
 nor
must they be of too great length, or beset with difficulties, because there=
 is
always a loss of strength on a long road, which tends to weaken the conditi=
on
of an army.
</p>

<p>
By their second purpose, that is as lines of retreat, they constitute in a =
real
sense the strategic rear of the army.
</p>

<p>
For both purposes the value of these roads depends on their <i>length</i>,
their <i>number</i>, their <i>situation</i>, that is their general directio=
n,
and their direction specially as regards the army, their <i>nature</i> as
roads, <i>difficulties</i> of <i>ground</i>, the <i>political relations and
feeling of local population</i>, and lastly, on the <i>protection</i> they
derive from fortresses or natural obstacles in the country.
</p>

<p>
But all the roads which lead from the point occupied by an army to its sour=
ces
of existence and power, are not on that account necessarily lines of
communication for that army. They may no doubt be used for that purpose, an=
d
may be considered as supplementary of the system of communication, but that
system is confined to the lines regularly prepared for the purpose. Only th=
ose
roads on which magazines, hospitals, stations, posts for despatches and let=
ters
are organised under commandants with police and garrisons, can be looked up=
on
as real lines of communication. But here a very important difference betwee=
n
our own and the enemy=E2=80=99s army makes its appearance, one which is oft=
en
overlooked. An army, even in its own country, has its prepared lines of
communication, but it is not completely limited to them, and can in case of
need change its line, taking some other which presents itself, for it is ev=
ery
where at home, has officials in authority, and the friendly feeling of the
people. Therefore, although other roads may not be as good as those at firs=
t
selected there is nothing to prevent their being used, and the use of them =
is
not to be regarded as <i>impossible</i> in case the army is turned and obli=
ged
to change its front. An army in an enemy=E2=80=99s country on the contrary =
can as
a rule only look upon those roads as lines of communication upon which it h=
as
advanced; and hence arises through small and almost invisible causes a grea=
t
difference in operating. The army in the enemy=E2=80=99s country takes unde=
r its
protection the organisation which, as it advances, it necessarily introduce=
s to
form its lines of communication; and in general, inasmuch as terror, and th=
e
presence of an enemy=E2=80=99s army in the country invests these measures i=
n the
eyes of the inhabitants with all the weight of unalterable necessity, the
inhabitants may even be brought to regard them as an alleviation of the evi=
ls
inseparable from war. Small garrisons left behind in different places suppo=
rt
and maintain this system. But if these commissaries, commandants of station=
s,
police, fieldposts, and the rest of the apparatus of administration, were s=
ent
to some distant road upon which the army had not been seen, the inhabitants
then would look upon such measures as a burden which they would gladly get =
rid
of, and if the most complete defeats and catastrophes had not previously sp=
read
terror throughout the land, the probability is that these functionaries wou=
ld
be treated as enemies, and driven away with very rough usage. Therefore in =
the
first place it would be necessary to establish garrisons to subjugate the n=
ew
line, and these garrisons would require to be of more than ordinary strengt=
h,
and still there would always be a danger of the inhabitants rising and
attempting to overpower them. In short, an army marching into an enemy=E2=
=80=99s
country is destitute of the mechanism through which obedience is rendered; =
it
has to institute its officials into their places, which can only be done by=
 a
strong hand, and this cannot be effected thoroughly without sacrifices and
difficulties, nor is it the work of a moment=E2=80=94From this it follows t=
hat a
change of the system of communication is much less easy of accomplishment i=
n an
enemy=E2=80=99s country than in our own, where it is at least possible; and=
 it
also follows that the army is more restricted in its movements, and must be
much more sensitive about any demonstrations against its communications.
</p>

<p>
But the choice and organisation of lines of communication is from the very
commencement subject also to a number of conditions by which it is restrict=
ed.
Not only must they be in a general sense good high roads, but they will be =
the
more serviceable the wider they are, the more populous and wealthy towns th=
ey
pass through, the more strong places there are which afford them protection=
.
Rivers, also, as means of water communication, and bridges as points of
passage, have a decisive weight in the choice. It follows from this that th=
e
situation of a line of communication, and consequently the road by which an
army proceeds to commence the offensive, is only a matter of free choice up=
 to
a certain point, its situation being dependent on certain geographical
relations.
</p>

<p>
All the foregoing circumstances taken together determine the strength or
weakness of the communication of an army with its base, and this result,
compared with one similarly obtained with regard to the enemy=E2=80=99s
communications, decides which of the two opponents is in a position to oper=
ate
against the other=E2=80=99s lines of communication, or to cut off his retre=
at,
that is, in technical language to <i>turn him</i>. Setting aside all
considerations of moral or physical superiority, that party can only
effectually accomplish this whose communications are the strongest of the t=
wo,
for otherwise the enemy saves himself in the shortest mode, by a counterstr=
oke.
</p>

<p>
Now this turning can, by reason of the double signification of these lines,
have also two purposes. Either the communications may be interfered with an=
d
interrupted, that the enemy may melt away by degrees from want, and thus be
compelled to retreat, or the object may be directly to cut off the retreat.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the first, we have to observe that a mere momentary interrup=
tion
will seldom have any effect while armies are subsisted as they now are; a
certain time is requisite to produce an effect in this way in order that th=
e
losses of the enemy by frequent repetition may compensate in number for the
small amount he suffers in each case. One single enterprise against the
enemy=E2=80=99s flank, which might have been a decisive stroke in those day=
s when
thousands of bread-waggons traversed the lines of communication, carrying o=
ut
the systematised method then in force for subsisting troops, would hardly
produce any effect now, if ever so successful; one convoy at most might be
seized, which would cause the enemy some partial damage, but never compel h=
im
to retreat.
</p>

<p>
The consequence is, that enterprises of this description on a flank, which =
have
always been more in fashion in books than in real warfare, now appear less =
of a
practical nature than ever, and we may safely say that there is no danger i=
n
this respect to any lines of communication but such as are very long, and
otherwise unfavourably circumstanced, more especially by being exposed
everywhere and at any moment to attacks from an <i>insurgent population</i>=
.
</p>

<p>
With respect to the cutting off an enemy=E2=80=99s retreat, we must not be
overconfident in this respect either of the consequences of threatening or
closing the enemy=E2=80=99s lines of retreat, as recent experience has show=
n
that, when troops are good and their leader resolute, it is <i>more
difficult</i> to make them prisoners, than it is for them to cut their way
through the force opposed to them.
</p>

<p>
The means of shortening and protecting long lines of communication are very
limited. The seizure of some fortresses adjacent to the position taken up b=
y
the army, and on the roads leading to the rear=E2=80=94or in the event of t=
here
being no fortresses in the country, the construction of temporary defences =
at
suitable points=E2=80=94the kind treatment of the people of the country, st=
rict
discipline on the military roads, good police, and active measures to impro=
ve
the roads, are the only means by which the evil may be diminished, but it i=
s
one which can never be entirely removed.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, what we said when treating of the question of subsistence with
respect to the roads which the army should chose by preference, applies als=
o
particularly to lines of communication. The best lines of communication are
roads leading through the most flourishing towns and the most important
provinces; they ought to be preferred, even if considerably longer, and in =
most
cases they exercise an important influence on the definitive disposition of=
 the
army.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap63"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>On Country and Ground</h3>

<p>
Quite irrespective of their influence as regards the means of subsistence o=
f an
army, country and ground bear another most intimate and never-failing relat=
ion
to the business of war, which is their decisive influence on the battle, bo=
th
upon what concerns its course, as well as upon the preparation for it, and =
the
use to be made of it. We now proceed to consider country and ground in this
phase, that is, in the full meaning of the French expression
=E2=80=9C<i>Terrain.</i>=E2=80=9D
</p>

<p>
The way to make use of them is a subject which lies mostly within the provi=
nce
of tactics, but the effects resulting from them appear in strategy; a battl=
e in
the mountains is, in its consequences as well as in itself, quite a differe=
nt
thing from a battle on a level plain.
</p>

<p>
But until we have studied the distinction between offensive and defensive, =
and
examined the nature of each separately and fully, we cannot enter upon the
consideration of the principal features of the ground in their effects; we =
must
therefore for the present confine ourselves to an investigation of its gene=
ral
properties. There are three properties through which the ground has an
influence on action in war; that is, as presenting an obstacle to approach,=
 as
an obstacle to an extensive view, and as protection against the effect of
fire-arms; all other effects may be traced back to these three.
</p>

<p>
Unquestionably this threefold influence of ground has a tendency to make
warfare more diversified, more complicated, and more scientific, for they a=
re
plainly three more quantities which enter into military combinations.
</p>

<p>
A completely level plain, quite open at the same time, that is, a tract of
country which cannot influence war at all, has no existence except in relat=
ion
to small bodies of troops, and with respect to them only for the duration o=
f
some given moment of time. When larger bodies are concerned, and a longer
duration of time, accidents of ground mix themselves up with the action of =
such
bodies, and it is hardly possible in the case of a whole army to imagine an=
y
particular moment, such as a battle, when the ground would not make its
influence felt.
</p>

<p>
This influence is therefore never in abeyance, but it is certainly stronger=
 or
weaker according to the nature of the country.
</p>

<p>
If we keep in view the great mass of topographical phenomena we find that
countries deviate from the idea of perfectly open level plains principally =
in
three ways: first by the form of the ground, that is, hills and valleys; th=
en
by woods, marshes, and lakes as natural features; and lastly, by such chang=
es
as have been introduced by the hand of man. Through each of these three
circumstances there is an increase in the influence of ground on the operat=
ions
of war. If we trace them up to a certain distance we have mountainous count=
ry,
a country little cultivated and covered with woods and marshes, and the wel=
l
cultivated. The tendency in each case is to render war more complicated and
connected with art.
</p>

<p>
The degree of influence which cultivation exercises is greater or less
according to the nature of the cultivation; the system pursued in Flanders,
Holstein, and some other countries, where the land is intersected in every
direction with ditches, dykes, hedges, and walls, interspersed with many si=
ngle
dwellings and small woods has the greatest effect on war.
</p>

<p>
The conduct of war is therefore of the easiest kind in a level
moderately-cultivated country. This however only holds good in quite a gene=
ral
sense, leaving entirely out of consideration the use which the defensive ca=
n
make of obstacles of ground.
</p>

<p>
Each of these three kinds of ground has an effect in its own way on movemen=
t,
on the range of sight, and in the cover it affords.
</p>

<p>
In a thickly-wooded country the obstacle to sight preponderates; in a
mountainous country, the difficulty of movement presents the greatest obsta=
cle
to an enemy; in countries very much cultivated both these obstacles exist i=
n a
medium degree.
</p>

<p>
As thick woods render great portions of ground in a certain manner
impracticable for military movements, and as, besides the difficulty which =
they
oppose to movement they also obstruct the view, thereby preventing the use =
of
means to clear a passage, the result is that they simplify the measures to =
be
adopted on one side in proportion as they increase the difficulties with wh=
ich
the other side has to contend. Although it is difficult practically to
concentrate forces for action in a wooded country, still a partition of for=
ces
does not take place to the same extent as it usually does in a mountainous
country, or in a country very much intersected with canals, rivers, &amp;c.=
: in
other words, the partition of forces in such a country is more unavoidable =
but
not so great.
</p>

<p>
In mountains, the obstacles to movement preponderate and take effect in two
ways, because in some parts the country is quite impassable, and where it i=
s
practicable we must move slower and with greater difficulty. On this accoun=
t
the rapidity of all movements is much diminished in mountains, and all
operations are mixed up with a larger quantity of the element of time. But =
the
ground in mountains has also the special property peculiar to itself, that =
one
point commands another. We shall devote the following chapter to the discus=
sion
of the subject of commanding heights generally, and shall only here remark =
that
it is this peculiarity which causes the great partition of forces in operat=
ions
carried on amongst mountains, for particular points thus acquire importance
from the influence they have upon other points in addition to any intrinsic
value which they have in themselves.
</p>

<p>
As we have elsewhere observed, each of these three kinds of ground in
proportion as its own special peculiarity has a tendency to an extreme, has=
 in
the same degree a tendency to lower the influence of the supreme command,
increasing in like manner the independent action of subordinates down to th=
e
private soldier. The greater the partition of any force, the less an undivi=
ded
control is possible, so much the more are subordinates left to themselves; =
that
is self-evident. Certainly when the partition of a force is greater, then
through the diversity of action and greater scope in the use of means the
influence of intelligence must increase, and even the commander-in-chief ma=
y
show his talents to advantage under such circumstances; but we must here re=
peat
what has been said before, that in war the sum total of single results deci=
des
more than the form or method in which they are connected, and therefore, if=
 we
push our present considerations to an extreme case, and suppose a whole arm=
y
extended in a line of skirmishers so that each private soldier fights his o=
wn
little battle, more will depend on the sum of single victories gained than =
on
the form in which they are connected; for the benefit of good combinations =
can
only follow from positive results, not from negative. Therefore in such a c=
ase
the courage, the dexterity, and the spirit of individuals will prove decisi=
ve.
It is only when two opposing armies are on a par as regards military qualit=
ies,
or that their peculiar properties hold the balance even, that the talent an=
d
judgment of the commander become again decisive. The consequence is that
national armies and insurgent levies, etc., etc., in which, at least in the
individual, the warlike spirit is highly excited, although they are not
superior in skill and bravery, are still able to maintain a superiority by =
a
great dispersion of their forces favoured by a difficult country, and that =
they
can only maintain themselves for a continuance upon that kind of system,
because troops of this description are generally destitute of all the quali=
ties
and virtues which are indispensable when tolerably large numbers are requir=
ed
to act as a united body.
</p>

<p>
Also in the nature of forces there are many gradations between one of these
extremes and the other, for the very circumstance of being engaged in the
defence of its own country gives to even a regular standing army something =
of
the character of a national army, and makes it more suited for a war waged =
by
an army broken up into detachments.
</p>

<p>
Now the more these qualifications and influences are wanting in an army, th=
e
greater they are on the side of its opponent, so much the more will it drea=
d
being split into fractions, the more it will avoid a broken country; but to
avoid fighting in such a description of country is seldom a matter of choic=
e;
we cannot choose a theatre of war like a piece of merchandise from amongst
several patterns, and thus we find generally that armies which from their
nature fight with advantage in concentrated masses, exhaust all their ingen=
uity
in trying to carry out their system as far as possible in direct opposition
<i>to the nature of the country</i>. They must in consequence submit to oth=
er
disadvantages, such as scanty and difficult subsistence for the troops, bad
quarters, and in the combat numerous attacks from all sides; but the
disadvantage of giving up their own special advantage would be greater.
</p>

<p>
These two tendencies in opposite directions, the one to concentration the o=
ther
to dispersion of forces, prevail more or less according as the nature of th=
e
troops engaged incline them more to one side or the other, but however deci=
ded
the tendency, the one side cannot always remain with his forces concentrate=
d,
neither can the other expect success by following his system of warfare in
scattered bodies on all occasions. The French were obliged to resort to
partitioning their forces in Spain, and the Spaniards, whilst defending the=
ir
country by means of an insurgent population, were obliged to try the fate o=
f
great battles in the open field with part of their forces.
</p>

<p>
Next to the connection which country and ground have with the general, and
especially with the political, composition of the forces engaged, the most
important point is the relative proportion of the three arms.
</p>

<p>
In all countries which are difficult to traverse, whether the obstacles are
mountains, forests, or a peculiar cultivation, a numerous cavalry is useles=
s:
that is plain in itself; it is just the same with artillery in wooded
countries; there will probably be a want of room to use it with effect, of
roads to transport it, and of forage for the horses. For this arm highly
cultivated countries are less disadvantageous, and least of all a mountaino=
us
country. Both, no doubt, afford cover against its fire, and in that respect
they are unfavourable to an arm which depends entirely on its fire: both al=
so
often furnish means for the enemy=E2=80=99s infantry to place the heavy art=
illery
in jeopardy, as infantry can pass anywhere; but still in neither is there i=
n
general any want of space for the use of a numerous artillery, and in
mountainous countries it has this great advantage, that its effects are
prolonged and increased in consequence of the movements of the enemy being
slower.
</p>

<p>
But it is undeniable that infantry has a decided advantage over every other=
 arm
in difficult country, and that, therefore, in such a country its number may
considerably exceed the usual proportion.

<h3><a name=3D"chap64"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>Command of Ground</h3>

<p>
The word =E2=80=9Ccommand=E2=80=9D has a charm in the art of war peculiar t=
o
itself, and in fact to this element belongs a great part, perhaps half the
influence which ground exercises on the use of troops. Here many of the sac=
red
relics of military erudition have their root, as, for instance, commanding
positions, key positions, strategic man=C5=93uvres, etc. We shall take as c=
lear a
view of the subject as we can without prolixity, and pass in review the tru=
e
and the false, reality and exaggeration.
</p>

<p>
Every exertion of physical force if made upwards is more difficult than if =
it
is made in the contrary direction (downwards); consequently it must be so i=
n
fighting; and there are three evident reasons why it is so. First, every he=
ight
may be regarded as an obstacle to approach; secondly, although the range is=
 not
perceptibly greater in shooting down from a height, yet, all geometrical
relations being taken into consideration, we have a better chance of hittin=
g
than in the opposite case; thirdly, an elevation gives a better command of
view. How all these advantages unite themselves together in battle we are n=
ot
concerned with here; we collect the sum total of the advantages which tacti=
cs
derives from elevation of position and combine them in one whole which we
regard as the first strategic advantage.
</p>

<p>
But the first and last of these advantages that have been enumerated must
appear once more as advantages of strategy itself, for we march and reconno=
itre
in strategy as well as in tactics; if, therefore, an elevated position is a=
n
obstacle to the approach of those on lower ground, that is the second; and =
the
better command of view which this elevated position affords is the third
advantage which strategy may derive in this way.
</p>

<p>
Of these elements is composed the power of dominating, overlooking, command=
ing;
from these sources springs the sense of superiority and security which is f=
elt
in standing on the brow of a hill and looking at the enemy below, and the
feeling of weakness and apprehension which pervades the minds of those belo=
w.
Perhaps the total impression made is at the same time stronger than it ough=
t to
be, because the advantage of the higher ground strikes the senses more than=
 the
circumstances which modify that advantage. Perhaps the impression made
surpasses that which the truth warrants, in which case the effect of
imagination must be regarded as a new element, which exaggerates the effect
produced by an elevation of ground.
</p>

<p>
At the same time the advantage of greater facility of movement is not absol=
ute,
and not always in favour of the side occupying the higher position; it is o=
nly
so when his opponent wishes to attack him; it is not if the combatants are
separated by a great valley, and it is actually in favour of the army on th=
e
lower ground if both wish to fight in the plain (battle of Hohenfriedberg).
Also the power of overlooking, or command of view, has likewise great
limitations. A wooded country in the valley below, and often the very masse=
s of
the mountains themselves on which we stand, obstruct the vision. Countless =
are
the cases in which we might seek in vain on the spot for those advantages o=
f an
elevated position which a map would lead us to expect; and we might often b=
e
led to think we had only involved ourselves in all kinds of disadvantages, =
the
very opposite of the advantages we counted upon. But these limitations and
conditions do not abrogate or destroy the superiority which the more elevat=
ed
position confers, both on the defensive and offensive. We shall point out, =
in a
few words, how this is the case with each.
</p>

<p>
Out of the three strategic advantages of the more elevated ground, <i>the
greater tactical strength, the more difficult approach</i>, and <i>the bett=
er
view</i>, the first two are of such a nature that they belong really to the
defensive only; for it is only in holding firmly to a position that we can =
make
use of them, whilst the other side (offensive) in moving cannot remove them=
 and
take them with him; but the third advantage can be made use of by the offen=
sive
just as well as by the defensive.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows that the more elevated ground is highly important to t=
he
defensive, and as it can only be maintained in a decisive way in mountainou=
s
countries, therefore it would seem to follow, as a consequence, that the
defensive has an important advantage in mountain positions. How it is that,
through other circumstances, this is not so in reality, we shall show in th=
e
chapter on the defence of mountains.
</p>

<p>
We must first of all make a distinction if the question relates merely to
commanding ground at one single point, as, for example, a position for an a=
rmy;
in such case the strategic advantages rather merge in the tactical one of a
battle fought under advantageous circumstances; but if now we imagine a
considerable tract of country=E2=80=94suppose a whole province=E2=80=94as a=
 regular
slope, like the declivity at a general watershed, so that we can make sever=
al
marches, and always hold the upper ground, then the strategic advantages be=
come
greater, because we can now use the advantages of the more elevated ground =
not
only in the combination of our forces with each other for one particular
combat, but also in the combination of several combats with one another. Th=
us
it is with the defensive.
</p>

<p>
As regards the offensive, it enjoys to a certain extent the same advantages=
 as
the defensive from the more elevated ground; for this reason that the strag=
etic
attack is not confined to one act like the tactical. The strategic advance =
is
not the continuous movement of a piece of wheelwork; it is made in single
marches with a longer or shorter interval between them, and at each halting
point the assailant is just as much acting on the defensive as his adversar=
y.
</p>

<p>
Through the advantage of a better view of the surrounding country, an eleva=
ted
position confers, in a certain measure, on the offensive as well as the
defensive, a power of action which we must not omit to notice; it is the
facility of operating with separate masses. For each portion of a force
separately derives the same advantages which the whole derives from this mo=
re
elevated position; by this=E2=80=94a separate corps, let it be strong or we=
ak in
numbers, is stronger than it would otherwise be, and we can venture to take=
 up
a position with less danger than we could if it had not that particular
property of being on an elevation. The advantages which are to be derived f=
rom
such separate bodies of troops is a subject for another place.
</p>

<p>
If the possession of more elevated ground is combined with other geographic=
al
advantages which are in our favour, if the enemy finds himself cramped in h=
is
movements from other causes, as, for instance, by the proximity of a large
river, such disadvantages of his position may prove quite decisive, and he =
may
feel that he cannot too soon relieve himself from such a position. No army =
can
maintain itself in the valley of a great river if it is not in possession o=
f
the heights on each side by which the valley is formed.
</p>

<p>
The possession of elevated ground may therefore become virtually command, a=
nd
we can by no means deny that this idea represents a reality. But neverthele=
ss
the expressions =E2=80=9Ccommanding ground,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Csheltering
position,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Ckey of the country,=E2=80=9D in so far as they =
are
founded on the nature of heights and descents, are hollow shells without an=
y
sound kernel. These imposing elements of theory have been chiefly resorted =
to
in order to give a flavour to the seeming commonplace of military combinati=
ons;
they have become the darling themes of learned soldiers, the magical wands =
of
adepts in strategy, and neither the emptiness of these fanciful conceits, n=
or
the frequent contradictions which have been given to them by the results of
experience have sufficed to convince authors, and those who read their book=
s,
that with such phraseology they are drawing water in the leaky vessel of th=
e
Danaides. The conditions have been mistaken for the thing itself, the
instrument for the hand. The occupation of such and such a position or spac=
e of
ground, has been looked upon as an exercise of power like a thrust or a cut=
,
the ground or position itself as a substantive quantity; whereas the one is
like the lifting of the arm, the other is nothing but the lifeless instrume=
nt,
a mere property which can only realise itself upon an object, a mere sign o=
f
plus or minus which wants the figures or quantities. This cut and thrust, t=
his
object, this quantity, is <i>a victorious battle;</i> it alone really count=
s;
with it only can we reckon; and we must always have it in view, as well in
giving a critical judgment in literature as in real action in the field.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, if nothing but the number and value of victorious combats dec=
ides
in war, it is plain that the comparative value of the opposing armies and
ability of their respective leaders again rank as the first points for
consideration, and that the part which the influence of ground plays can on=
ly
be one of an inferior grade.

<h4>
1.=E2=80=94Conception of Defence.
</h4>

<p>
What is defence in conception? The warding off a blow. What is then its
characteristic sign? The state of expectancy (or of waiting for this blow).
This is the sign by which we always recognise an act as of a defensive
character, and by this sign alone can the defensive be distinguished from t=
he
offensive in war. But inasmuch as an absolute defence completely contradict=
s
the idea of war, because there would then be war carried on by one side onl=
y,
it follows that the defence in war can only be relative and the above
distinguishing signs must therefore only be applied to the essential idea o=
r
general conception: it does not apply to all the separate acts which compos=
e
the war. A partial combat is defensive if we receive the onset, the charge =
of
the enemy; a battle is so if we receive the attack, that is, wait for the
appearance of the enemy before our position and within range of our fire; a
campaign is defensive if we wait for the entry of the enemy into our theatr=
e of
war. In all these cases the sign of waiting for and warding off belongs to =
the
general conception, without any contradiction arising with the conception o=
f
war, for it may be to our advantage to wait for the charge against our
bayonets, or the attack on our position or our theatre of war. But as we mu=
st
return the enemy=E2=80=99s blows if we are really to carry on war on our si=
de,
therefore this offensive act in defensive war takes place more or less unde=
r
the general title defensive=E2=80=94that is to say, the offensive of which =
we
make use falls under the conception of position or theatre of war. We can,
therefore, in a defensive campaign fight offensively, in a defensive battle=
 we
may use some divisions for offensive purposes, and lastly, while remaining =
in
position awaiting the enemy=E2=80=99s onslaught, we still make use of the
offensive by sending at the same time balls into the enemy=E2=80=99s ranks.=
 The
defensive form in war is therefore no mere shield but a shield formed of bl=
ows
delivered with skill.
</p>

<h4>
2.=E2=80=94Advantages of the Defensive.
</h4>

<p>
What is the object of defence? <i>To preserve</i>. To preserve is easier th=
an
to acquire; from which follows at once that the means on both sides being
supposed equal, the defensive is easier than the offensive. But in what
consists the greater facility of preserving or keeping possession? In this,
that all time which is not turned to any account falls into the scale in fa=
vour
of the defence. He reaps where he has not sowed. Every suspension of offens=
ive
action, either from erroneous views, from fear or from indolence, is in fav=
our
of the side acting defensively. This advantage saved the State of Prussia f=
rom
ruin more than once in the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War. It is one which derive=
s
itself from the conception and object of the defensive, lies in the nature =
of
all defence, and in ordinary life, particularly in legal business which bea=
rs
so much resemblance to war, it is expressed by the Latin proverb, <i>Beati =
sunt
possidentes</i>. Another advantage arising from the nature of war and belon=
ging
to it exclusively, is the aid afforded by locality or ground; this is one o=
f
which the defensive form has a preferential use.
</p>

<p>
Having established these general ideas we now turn more directly to the
subject.
</p>

<p>
In tactics every combat, great or small, is <i>defensive</i> if we leave th=
e
initiative to the enemy, and wait for his appearance in our front. From tha=
t
moment forward we can make use of all offensive means without losing the sa=
id
two advantages of the defence, namely, that of waiting for, and that of gro=
und.
In strategy, at first, the campaign represents the battle, and the theatre =
of
war the position; but afterwards the whole war takes the place of the campa=
ign,
and the whole country that of the theatre of war, and in both cases the
defensive remains that which it was in tactics.
</p>

<p>
It has been already observed in a general way that the defensive is easier =
than
the offensive; but as the defensive has a negative object, that of
<i>preserving</i>, and the offensive a positive object that of
<i>conquering</i>, and as the latter increases our own means of carrying on
war, but the preserving does not, therefore in order to express ourselves
distinctly, we must say, <i>that the defensive form of war is in itself
stronger than the offensive</i>. This is the result we have been desirous o=
f
arriving at; for although it lies completely in the nature of the thing, an=
d
has been confirmed by experience a thousand times, still it is completely
contrary to prevalent opinion=E2=80=94a proof how ideas may be confused by
superficial writers.
</p>

<p>
If the defensive is the stronger form of conducting war, but has a negative
object, it follows of itself that we must only make use of it so long as ou=
r
weakness compels us to do so, and that we must give up that form as soon as=
 we
feel strong enough to aim at the positive object. Now as the state of our
circumstances is usually improved in the event of our gaining a victory thr=
ough
the assistance of the defensive, it is therefore, also, the natural course =
in
war to begin with the defensive, and to end with the offensive. It is there=
fore
just as much in contradiction with the conception of war to suppose the
defensive the ultimate object of the war as it was a contradiction to
understand passivity to belong to all the parts of the defensive, as well a=
s to
the defensive as a whole. In other words: a war in which victories are mere=
ly
used to ward off blows, and where there is no attempt to return the blow, w=
ould
be just as absurd as a battle in which the most absolute defence (passivity=
)
should everywhere prevail in all measures.
</p>

<p>
Against the justice of this general view many examples might be quoted in w=
hich
the defensive continued defensive to the last, and the assumption of the
offensive was never contemplated; but such an objection could only be urged=
 if
we lost sight of the fact that here the question is only about general idea=
s
(abstract ideas), and that examples in opposition to the general conception=
 we
are discussing are all of them to be looked upon as cases in which the time=
 for
the possibility of offensive reaction had not yet arrived.
</p>

<p>
In the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, at least in the last three years of it,
Frederick the Great did not think of an offensive; indeed we believe furthe=
r,
that generally speaking, he only acted on the offensive at any time in this=
 war
as the best means of defending himself; his whole situation compelled him t=
o
this course, and it is natural that a general should aim more immediately a=
t
that which is most in accordance with the situation in which he is placed f=
or
the time being. Nevertheless, we cannot look at this example of a defence u=
pon
a great scale without supposing that the idea of a possible counterstroke
against Austria lay at the bottom of the whole of it, and saying to ourselv=
es,
the moment for that counterstroke had not arrived before the war came to a
close. The conclusion of peace shows that this idea is not without foundati=
on
even in this instance; for what could have actuated the Austrians to make p=
eace
except the thought that they were not in a condition with their own forces
alone to make head against the talent of the king; that to maintain an
equilibrium their exertions must be greater than heretofore, and that the
slightest relaxation of their efforts would probably lead to fresh losses o=
f
territory. And, in fact, who can doubt that if Russia, Sweden, and the army=
 of
the German Empire had ceased to act together against Frederick the Great he
would have tried to conquer the Austrians again in Bohemia and Moravia?
</p>

<p>
Having thus defined the true meaning of the defensive, having defined its
boundaries, we return again to the assertion that the defensive <i>is the
stronger form of making war.</i>
</p>

<p>
Upon a closer examination, and comparison of the offensive and defensive, t=
his
will appear perfectly plain; but for the present we shall confine ourselves=
 to
noticing the contradiction in which we should be involved with ourselves, a=
nd
with the results of experience by maintaining the contrary to be the fact. =
If
the offensive form was the stronger there would be no further occasion ever=
 to
use the defensive, as it has merely a negative object, every one would be f=
or
attacking, and the defensive would be an absurdity. On the other hand, it i=
s
very natural that the higher object should be purchased by greater sacrific=
es.
Whoever feels himself strong enough to make use of the weaker form has it i=
n
his power to aim at the greater object; whoever sets before himself the sma=
ller
object can only do so in order to have the benefit of the stronger
form=E2=80=94If we look to experience, such a thing is unheard of as any on=
e
carrying on a war upon two different theatres=E2=80=94offensively on one wi=
th the
weaker army, and defensively on the other with his strongest force But if t=
he
reverse of this has everywhere and at all times taken place that shows plai=
nly
that generals although their own inclination prompts them to the offensive,
still hold the defensive to be the stronger form. We have still in the next
chapters to explain some preliminary points.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap66"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>The Relations of the Offensive an=
d Defensive to Each Other in Tactics</h3>

<p>
First of all we must inquire into the circumstances which give the victory =
in a
battle.
</p>

<p>
Of superiority of numbers, and bravery, discipline, or other qualities of a=
n
army, we say nothing here, because, as a rule, they depend on things which =
lie
out of the province of the art of war in the sense in which we are now
considering it; besides which they exercise the same effect in the offensiv=
e as
the defensive; and, moreover also, the superiority in <i>numbers in general=
</i>
cannot come under consideration here, as the number of troops is likewise a
given quantity or condition, and does not depend on the will or pleasure of=
 the
general. Further, these things have no particular connection with attack an=
d
defence. But, irrespective of these things, there are other three which app=
ear
to us of decisive importance, these are: <i>surprise, advantage of ground</=
i>,
and <i>the attack from several quarters</i>. The surprise produces an effec=
t by
opposing to the enemy a great many more troops than he expected at some
particular point. The superiority in numbers in this case is very different=
 to
a general superiority of numbers; it is the most powerful agent in the art =
of
war.=E2=80=94The way in which the advantage of ground contributes to the vi=
ctory
is intelligible enough of itself, and we have only one observation to make
which is, that we do not confine our remarks to obstacles which obstruct th=
e
advance of an enemy, such as scarped grounds, high hills, marshy streams,
hedges, inclosures, etc.; we also allude to the advantage which ground affo=
rds
as cover, under which troops are concealed from view. Indeed we may say tha=
t
even from ground which is quite unimportant a person acquainted with the
locality may derive assistance. The attack from several quarters includes i=
n
itself all tactical turning movements great and small, and its effects are
derived partly from the double execution obtained in this way from fire-arm=
s,
and partly from the enemy=E2=80=99s dread of his retreat being cut off.
</p>

<p>
Now how do the offensive and defensive stand respectively in relation to th=
ese
things?
</p>

<p>
Having in view the three principles of victory just described, the answer t=
o
this question is, that only a small portion of the first and last of these
principles is in favour of the offensive, whilst the greater part of them, =
and
the whole of the second principle, are at the command of the party acting
defensively.
</p>

<p>
The offensive side can only have the advantage of one complete surprise of =
the
whole mass with the whole, whilst the defensive is in a condition to surpri=
se
incessantly, throughout the whole course of the combat, by the force and fo=
rm
which he gives to his partial attacks.
</p>

<p>
The offensive has greater facilities than the defensive for surrounding and
cutting off the whole, as the latter is in a manner in a fixed position whi=
le
the former is in a state of movement having reference to that position. But=
 the
superior advantage for an enveloping movement, which the offensive possesse=
s,
as now stated, is again limited to a movement against the whole mass; for
during the course of the combat, and with separate divisions of the force, =
it
is easier for the defensive than for the offensive to make attacks from sev=
eral
quarters, <i>because, as we have already said, the former is in a better
situation to surprise by the force and form of his attacks.</i>
</p>

<p>
That the defensive in an especial manner enjoys the assistance which ground
affords is plain in itself; as to what concerns the advantage which the
defensive has in surprising by the force and form of his attacks, that resu=
lts
from the offensive being obliged to approach by roads and paths where he ma=
y be
easily observed, whilst the defensive conceals his position, and, until alm=
ost
the decisive moment, remains invisible to his opponent.=E2=80=94Since the t=
rue
method of defence has been adopted, reconnaissances have gone quite out of
fashion, that is to say, they have become impossible. Certainly reconnaissa=
nces
are still made at times, but they seldom bring home much with them. Immense=
 as
is the advantage of being able to examine well a position, and become perfe=
ctly
acquainted with it before a battle, plain as it is that he (the defensive) =
who
lies in wait near such a chosen position can much more easily effect a surp=
rise
than his adversary, yet still to this very hour the old notion is not explo=
ded
that a battle which is accepted is half lost. This comes from the old kind =
of
defensive practised twenty years ago, and partly also in the Seven Years=E2=
=80=99
War, when the only assistance expected from the ground was that it should b=
e
difficult of approach in front (by steep mountain slopes, etc., etc.), when=
 the
little depth of the positions and the difficulty of moving the flanks produ=
ced
such weakness that the armies dodged one another from one hill to another,
which increased the evil. If some kind of support were found on which to re=
st
the wings, then all depended on preventing the army stretched along between
these points, like a piece of work on an embroidery frame, from being broke=
n
through at any point. The ground occupied possessed a direct value at every
point, and therefore a direct defence was required everywhere. Under such
circumstances, the idea of making a movement or attempting a surprise durin=
g
the battle could not be entertained; it was the exact reverse of what
constitutes a good defence, and of that which the defence has actually beco=
me
in modern warfare.
</p>

<p>
In reality, contempt for the defensive has always been the result of some
particular method of defence having become worn out (outlived its period); =
and
this was just the case with the method we have now mentioned, for in times
antecedent to the period we refer to, that very method was superior to the
offensive.
</p>

<p>
If we go through the progressive development of the modern art of war, we f=
ind
that at the commencement=E2=80=94that is the Thirty Years=E2=80=99 War and =
the war
of the Spanish Succession=E2=80=94the deployment and drawing up of the army=
 in
array, was one of the great leading points connected with the battle. It wa=
s
the most important part of the plan of the battle. This gave the defensive,=
 as
a rule, a great advantage, as he was already drawn up and deployed. As soon=
 as
the troops acquired greater capability of man=C5=93uvring, this advantage c=
eased,
and the superiority passed over to the side of the offensive for a time. Th=
en
the defensive sought shelter behind rivers or deep valleys, or on high land=
.
The defensive thus recovered the advantage, and continued to maintain it un=
til
the offensive acquired such increased mobility and expertness in man=C5=93u=
vring
that he himself could venture into broken ground and attack in separate
columns, and therefore became able <i>to turn</i> his adversary. This led t=
o a
gradual increase in the length of positions, in consequence of which, no do=
ubt,
it occurred to the offensive to concentrate at a few points, and break thro=
ugh
the enemy=E2=80=99s thin line. The offensive thus, for a third time, gained=
 the
ascendancy, and the defence was again obliged to alter its system. This it =
has
done in recent wars by keeping its forces concentrated in large masses, the
greater part not deployed, and, where possible, concealed, thus merely taki=
ng
up a position in readiness to act according to the measures of the enemy as
soon as they are sufficiently revealed.
</p>

<p>
This does not preclude a partially passive defence of the ground; its advan=
tage
is too great for it not to be used a hundred times in a campaign. But that =
kind
of passive defence of the ground is usually no longer the principal affair:
that is what we have to do with here.
</p>

<p>
If the offensive should discover some new and powerful element which it can
bring to its assistance=E2=80=94an event not very probable, seeing the poin=
t of
simplicity and natural order to which all is now brought=E2=80=94then the d=
efence
must again alter its method. But the defensive is always certain of the
assistance of ground, which insures to it in general its natural superiorit=
y,
as the special properties of country and ground exercise a greater influenc=
e
than ever on actual warfare.

<h3><a name=3D"chap67"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>The Relations of the Offensive a=
nd Defensive to Each Other in Strategy</h3>

<p>
Let us ask again, first of all, what are the circumstances which insure a
successful result in strategy?
</p>

<p>
In strategy there is no victory, as we have before said. On the one hand, t=
he
strategic success is the successful preparation of the tactical victory; th=
e
greater this strategic success, the more probable becomes the victory in th=
e
battle. On the other hand, strategic success lies in the making use of the
victory gained. The more events the strategic combinations can in the seque=
l
include in the consequences of a battle gained, the more strategy can lay h=
ands
on amongst the wreck of all that has been shaken to the foundation by the
battle, the more it sweeps up in great masses what of necessity has been ga=
ined
with great labour by many single hands in the battle, the grander will be i=
ts
success.=E2=80=94Those things which chiefly lead to this success, or at lea=
st
facilitate it, consequently the leading principles of efficient action in
strategy, are as follow:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. The advantage of ground.
</p>

<p>
2. The surprise, let it be either in the form of an actual attack by surpri=
se
or by the unexpected display of large forces at certain points.
</p>

<p>
3. The attack from several quarters (all three, as in tactics).
</p>

<p>
4. The assistance of the theatre of war by fortresses, and everything belon=
ging
to them.
</p>

<p>
5. The support of the people.
</p>

<p>
6. The utilisation of great moral forces.
</p>

<p>
Now, what are the relations of offensive and defensive with respect to thes=
e
things?
</p>

<p>
The party on the defensive has the advantage of ground; the offensive side =
that
of the attack by surprise in strategy, as in tactics But respecting the
surprise, we must observe that it is infinitely more efficacious and import=
ant
in strategy than in tactics. In the latter, a surprise seldom rises to the
level of a great victory, while in strategy it often finishes the war at on=
e
stroke. But at the same time we must observe that the advantageous use of t=
his
means supposes some <i>great</i> and <i>uncommon</i>, as well as
<i>decisive</i> error committed by the adversary, therefore it does not alt=
er
the balance much in favour of the offensive.
</p>

<p>
The surprise of the enemy, by placing superior forces in position at certai=
n
points, has again a great resemblance to the analogous case in tactics. Wer=
e
the defensive compelled to distribute his forces upon several points of
approach to his theatre of war, then the offensive would have plainly the
advantage of being able to fall upon one point with all his weight. But her=
e
also, the new art of acting on the defensive by a different mode of proceed=
ing
has imperceptibly brought about new principles. If the defensive side does =
not
apprehend that the enemy, by making use of an undefended road, will throw
himself upon some important magazine or dep=C3=B4t, or on some unprepared
fortification, or on the capital itself.=E2=80=94and if he is not reduced t=
o the
alternative of opposing the enemy on the road he has chosen, or of having h=
is
retreat cut off, then there are no peremptory grounds for dividing his forc=
es;
for if the offensive chooses a different road from that on which the defens=
ive
is to be found, then some days later the latter can march against his oppon=
ent
with his whole force upon the road he has chosen; besides, he may at the sa=
me
time, in most cases, rest satisfied that the offensive will do him the hono=
ur
to seek him out.=E2=80=94If the offensive is obliged to advance with his fo=
rces
divided, which is often unavoidable on account of subsistence, then plainly=
 the
defensive has the advantage on his side of being able to fall in force upon=
 a
fraction of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Attacks in flank and rear, which in strategy mean on the sides and reverse =
of
the theatre of war, are of a very different nature to attacks so called in
tactics.
</p>

<p>
1st. There is no bringing the enemy under two fires, because we cannot fire
from one end of a theatre of war to the other.
</p>

<p>
2nd. The apprehension of losing the line of retreat is very much less, for =
the
spaces in strategy are so great that they cannot be barred as in tactics.
</p>

<p>
3rd. In strategy, on account of the extent of space embraced, the efficacy =
of
interior, that is of shorter lines, is much greater, and this forms a great
safeguard against attacks from several directions.
</p>

<p>
4th. A new principle makes its appearance in the sensibility, which is felt=
 as
to lines of communication, that is in the effect which is produced by merel=
y
interrupting them.
</p>

<p>
Now it confessedly lies in the nature of things, that on account of the gre=
ater
spaces in strategy, the enveloping attack, or the attack from several sides=
, as
a rule is only possible for the side which has the initiative, that is the
offensive, and that the defensive is not in a condition, as he is in tactic=
s,
in the course of the action, to turn the tables on the enemy by surrounding
him, because he has it not in his power either to draw up his forces with t=
he
necessary depth relatively, or to conceal them sufficiently: but then, of w=
hat
use is the facility of enveloping to the offensive, if its advantages are n=
ot
forthcoming? We could not therefore bring forward the enveloping attack in
strategy as a principle of victory in general, if its influence on the line=
s of
communication did not come into consideration. But this factor is seldom gr=
eat
at the first moment, when attack and defence first meet, and while they are
still opposed to each other in their original position; it only becomes gre=
at
as a campaign advances, when the offensive in the enemy=E2=80=99s country i=
s by
degrees brought into the condition of defensive; then the lines of
communication of this new party acting on the defensive, become weak, and t=
he
party originally on the defensive, in assuming the offensive can derive
advantage from this weakness. But who does not see that this casual superio=
rity
of the attack is not to be carried to the credit of the offensive in genera=
l,
for it is in reality created out of the superior relations of the defensive=
.
</p>

<p>
The fourth principle, the <i>Assistance of the Theatre of War</i>, is natur=
ally
an advantage on the side of the defensive. If the attacking army opens the
campaign, it breaks away from its own theatre, and is thus weakened, that i=
s,
it leaves fortresses and dep=C3=B4ts of all kinds behind it. The greater th=
e sphere
of operations which must be traversed, the more it will be weakened (by mar=
ches
and garrisons); the army on the defensive continues to keep up its connecti=
on
with everything, that is, it enjoys the support of its fortresses, is not
weakened in any way, and is near to its sources of supply.
</p>

<p>
<i>The support of the population</i> as a fifth principle is not realised i=
n
every defence, for a defensive campaign may be carried on in the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
country, but still this principle is only derived from the idea of the
defensive, and applies to it in the majority of cases. Besides by this is m=
eant
chiefly, although not exclusively, the effect of calling out the last Reser=
ves,
and even of a national armament, the result of which is that all friction i=
s
diminished, and that all resources are sooner forthcoming and flow in more
abundantly.
</p>

<p>
The campaign of 1812, gives as it were in a magnifying glass a very clear
illustration of the effect of the means specified under principles 3 and 4.
500,000 men passed the Niemen, 120,000 fought at Borodino, and much fewer
arrived at Moscow.
</p>

<p>
We may say that the effect itself of this stupendous attempt was so disastr=
ous
that even if the Russians had not assumed any offensive at all, they would
still have been secure from any fresh attempt at invasion for a considerabl=
e
time. It is true that with the exception of Sweden there is no country in
Europe which is situated like Russia, but the efficient principle is always=
 the
same, the only distinction being in the greater or less degree of its stren=
gth.
</p>

<p>
If we add to the fourth and fifth principles, the consideration that these
forces of the defensive belong to the original defensive, that is the defen=
sive
carried on in our own soil, and that they are much weaker if the defence ta=
kes
place in an enemy=E2=80=99s country and is mixed up with an offensive
undertaking, then from that there is a new disadvantage for the offensive, =
much
the same as above, in respect to the third principle; for the offensive is =
just
as little composed entirely of active elements, as the defensive of mere
warding off blows; indeed every attack which does not lead directly to peac=
e
must inevitably end in the defensive.
</p>

<p>
Now, if all defensive elements which are brought into use in the attack are
weakened by its nature, that is by belonging to the attack, then this must =
also
be considered as a general disadvantage of the offensive.
</p>

<p>
This is far from being an idle piece of logical refinement, on the contrary=
 we
should rather say that in it lies the chief disadvantage of the offensive i=
n
general, and therefore from the very commencement of, as well as throughout
every combination for a strategic attack, most particular attention ought t=
o be
directed to this point, that is to the defensive, which may follow, as we s=
hall
see more plainly when we come to the book on plans of campaigns.
</p>

<p>
The great moral forces which at times saturate the element of war, as it we=
re
with a leaven of their own, which therefore the commander in certain cases =
can
use to assist the other means at his command, are to be supposed just as we=
ll
on the side of the defensive as of the offensive; at least those which are =
more
especially in favour of the attack, such as confusion and disorder in the
enemy=E2=80=99s ranks=E2=80=94do not generally appear until after the decis=
ive
stroke is given, and consequently seldom contribute beforehand to produce t=
hat
result.
</p>

<p>
We think we have now sufficiently established our proposition, that the
<i>defensive is a stronger form of war than the offensive;</i> but there st=
ill
remains to be mentioned one small factor hitherto unnoticed. It is the high
spirit, the feeling of superiority in an army which springs from a
consciousness of belonging to the attacking party. The thing is in itself a
fact, but the feeling soon merges into the more general and more powerful o=
ne
which is imparted by victory or defeat, by the talent or incapacity of the
general.

<h3><a name=3D"chap68"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>Convergence of Attack and Diverge=
nce of Defence</h3>

<p>
These two conceptions, these forms in the use of offensive and defensive,
appear so frequently in theory and reality, that the imagination is
involuntarily disposed to look upon them as intrinsic forms, necessary to
attack and defence, which, however, is not really the case, as the smallest
reflection will show. We take the earliest opportunity of examining them, t=
hat
we may obtain once for all clear ideas respecting them, and that, in procee=
ding
with our consideration of the relations of attack and defence, we may be ab=
le
to set these conceptions aside altogether, and not have our attention for e=
ver
distracted by the appearance of advantage and the reverse which they cast u=
pon
things. We treat them here as pure abstractions, extract the conception of =
them
like an essence, and reserve our remarks on the part which it has in actual
things for a future time.
</p>

<p>
The defending party, both in tactics and in strategy, is supposed to be wai=
ting
in expectation, therefore standing, whilst the assailant is imagined to be =
in
movement, and in movement expressly directed against that standing adversar=
y.
It follows from this, necessarily, that turning and enveloping is at the op=
tion
of the assailant only, that is to say, as long as his movement and the
immobility of the defensive continue. This freedom of choice of the mode of
attack, whether it shall be convergent or not, according as it shall appear
advantageous or otherwise, ought to be reckoned as an advantage to the
offensive in general. But this choice is free only in tactics; it is not al=
ways
allowed in strategy. In the first, the points on which the wings rest are
hardly ever absolutely secure; but they are very frequently so in strategy,=
 as
when the front to be defended stretches in a straight line from one sea to
another, or from one neutral territory to another. In such cases, the attac=
k
cannot be made in a convergent form, and the liberty of choice is limited. =
It
is limited in a still more embarrassing manner if the assailant is obliged =
to
operate by converging lines. Russia and France cannot attack Germany in any
other way than by converging lines; therefore they cannot attack with their
forces united. Now if we assume as granted that the concentric form in the
action of forces in the majority of cases is the weaker form, then the
advantage which the assailant possesses in the greater freedom of choice ma=
y
probably be completely outweighed by the disadvantage, in other cases, of b=
eing
compelled to make use of the weaker form.
</p>

<p>
We proceed to examine more closely the action of these forms, both in tacti=
cs
and in strategy.
</p>

<p>
It has been considered one of the chief advantages of giving a concentric
direction to forces, that is, operating from the circumference of a circle
towards the centre, that the further the forces advance, the nearer they
approach to each other; the fact is true, but the supposed advantage is not=
;
for the tendency to union is going on equally on both sides; consequently, =
the
equilibrium is not disturbed. It is the same in the dispersion of force by
eccentric movements.
</p>

<p>
But another and a real advantage is, that forces operating on converging li=
nes
direct their action towards a <i>common point</i>, those operating on diver=
ging
lines do not.=E2=80=94Now what are the effects of the action in the two cas=
es?
Here we must separate tactics from strategy.
</p>

<p>
We shall not push the analysis too far, and therefore confine ourselves to =
the
following points as the advantages of the action in tactics.
</p>

<p>
1. A cross fire, or, at least, an increased effect of fire, as soon as all =
is
brought within a certain range.
</p>

<p>
2. Attack of one and the same point from several sides.
</p>

<p>
3. The cutting off the retreat.
</p>

<p>
The interception of a retreat may be also conceived strategically, but then=
 it
is plainly much more difficult, because great spaces are not easily blocked=
.
The attack upon one and the same body from several quarters is generally mo=
re
effectual and decisive, the smaller this body is, the nearer it approaches =
to
the lowest limit=E2=80=94that of a single combatant. An army can easily giv=
e
battle on several sides, a division less easily, a battalion only when form=
ed
in mass, a single man not at all. Now strategy, in its province, deals with
large masses of men, extensive spaces, and considerable duration of time; w=
ith
tactics, it is the reverse. From this follows that the attack from several
sides in strategy cannot have the same results as in tactics.
</p>

<p>
The effect of fire does not come within the scope of strategy; but in its p=
lace
there is something else. It is that tottering of the base which every army
feels when there is a victorious enemy in its rear, whether near or far off=
.
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, certain that the concentric action of forces has an advan=
tage
in this way, that the action or effect against a is at the same time one
against <i>b</i>, without its force against <i>a</i> being diminished, and =
that
the action against <i>b</i> is likewise action against <i>a</i>. The whole,
therefore, is not <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>, but something more; and this advanta=
ge
is produced both in tactics and strategy, although somewhat differently in
each.
</p>

<p>
Now what is there in the eccentric or divergent action of forces to oppose =
to
this advantage? Plainly the advantage of having the forces in greater proxi=
mity
to each other, and the moving on <i>interior lines</i>. It is unnecessary t=
o
demonstrate how this can become such a multiplier of forces that the assail=
ant
cannot encounter the advantage it gives his opponent unless he has a great
superiority of force.=E2=80=94When once the defensive has adopted the princ=
iple
of movement (movement which certainly commences later than that of the
assailant, but still time enough to break the chains of paralysing inaction=
),
then this advantage of greater concentration and the interior lines tends m=
uch
more decisively, and in most cases more effectually, towards victory than t=
he
concentric form of the attack. But victory must precede the realisation of =
this
superiority; we must conquer before we can think of cutting off an
enemy=E2=80=99s retreat. In short, we see that there is here a relation sim=
ilar
to that which exists between attack and defence generally; the concentric f=
orm
leads to brilliant results, the advantages of the eccentric are more secure=
:
the former is the weaker form with the positive object; the latter, the
stronger form with the negative object. In this way these two forms seem to=
 us
to be brought nearly to an even balance. Now if we add to this that the
defence, not being always absolute, is also not always precluded from using=
 its
forces on converging lines, we have no longer a right to believe that this
converging form is alone sufficient to ensure to the offensive a superiorit=
y
over the defensive universally, and thus we set ourselves free from the
influence which that opinion usually exercises over the judgment, whenever
there is an opportunity.
</p>

<p>
What has been said up to the present, relates to both tactics and strategy;=
 we
have still a most important point to bring forward, which applies to strate=
gy
only. The advantage of interior lines increases with the distances to which
these lines relate. In distances of a few thousand yards, or a half mile, t=
he
time which is gained, cannot of course be as much as in distances of severa=
l
days=E2=80=99 march, or indeed, of twenty or thirty miles; the first, that =
is,
the small distances, concerns tactics, the greater ones belong to strategy.
But, although we certainly require more time, to reach an object in strateg=
y,
than in tactics, and an army is not so quickly defeated as a battalion, sti=
ll,
these periods of time in strategy can only increase up to a certain point; =
that
is, they can only last until a battle takes place, or, perhaps, over and ab=
ove
that, for the few days during which a battle may be avoided without serious
loss. Further, there is a much greater difference in the real start in adva=
nce,
which is gained in one case, as compared with the other. Owing to the
insignificance of the distances in tactics, the movements of one army in a
battle, take place almost in sight of the other; the army, therefore, on th=
e
exterior line, will generally very soon be made aware of what his adversary=
 is
doing. From the long distances, with which strategy has to deal, it very se=
ldom
happens, that the movement of one army, is not concealed from the other for=
 at
least a day, and there are numerous instances, in which especially if the
movement is only partial, such as a considerable detachment, that it remain=
s
secret for weeks.=E2=80=94It is easy to see, what a great advantage this po=
wer of
concealing movements must be to that party, who through the nature of his
position has reason to desire it most.
</p>

<p>
We here close our considerations on the convergent and divergent use of for=
ces,
and the relation of those forms to attack and defence, proposing to return =
to
the subject at another time.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap69"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Character of the Strategic Defensi=
ve</h3>

<p>
We have already explained what the defensive is generally, namely, nothing =
more
than a stronger form of carrying on war, by means of which we endeavour to
wrest a victory, in order, after having gained a superiority, to pass over =
to
the offensive, that is to the positive object of war.
</p>

<p>
Even if the intention of a war is only the maintenance of the existing
situation of things, the <i>status quo</i>, still a mere parrying of a blow=
 is
something quite contradictory to the conception of the term war, because th=
e
conduct of war is unquestionably no mere state of endurance. If the defende=
r
has obtained an important advantage, then the defensive form has done its p=
art,
and under the protection of this success he must give back the blow, otherw=
ise
he exposes himself to certain destruction; common sense points out that iro=
n
should be struck while it is hot, that we should use the advantage gained t=
o
guard against a second attack. How, when and where this reaction shall comm=
ence
is subject certainly to a number of other conditions, which we can only exp=
lain
hereafter. For the present we keep to this, that we must always consider th=
is
transition to an offensive return as a natural tendency of the defensive,
therefore as an essential element of the same, and always conclude that the=
re
is something wrong in the management of a war when a victory gained through=
 the
defensive form is not turned to good account in any manner, but allowed to
wither away.
</p>

<p>
A swift and vigorous assumption of the offensive=E2=80=94the flashing sword=
 of
vengeance=E2=80=94is the most brilliant point in the defensive; he who does=
 not
at once think of it at the right moment, or rather he who does not from the
first include this transition in his idea of the defensive will never
understand the superiority of the defensive as a form of war; he will be fo=
r
ever thinking only of the means which will be consumed by the enemy and gai=
ned
by ourselves through the offensive, which means however depend not on tying=
 the
knot, but on untying it. Further, it is a stupid confusion of ideas if, und=
er
the term offensive, we always understand sudden attack or surprise, and
consequently under defensive imagine nothing but embarrassment and confusio=
n.
</p>

<p>
It is true that a conqueror makes his determination to go to war sooner tha=
n
the unconscious defender, and if he knows how to keep his measures properly
secret, he may also perhaps take the defender unawares; but that is a thing
quite foreign to war itself, for it should not be so. War actually takes pl=
ace
more for the defensive than for the conqueror, for invasion only calls fort=
h
resistance, and it is not until there is resistance that there is war. A
conqueror is always a lover of peace (as Buonaparte always asserted of
himself); he would like to make his entry into our state unopposed; in orde=
r to
prevent this, we must choose war, and therefore also make preparations, tha=
t is
in other words, it is just the weak, or that side which must defend itself,
which should be always armed in order not to be taken by surprise; so it is
willed by the art of war.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of one side sooner than the other in the theatre of war depe=
nds,
besides, in most cases on things quite different from a view to offensive o=
r
defensive. But although a view to one or other of these forms is not the ca=
use,
it is often the result of this priority of appearance. Whoever is first rea=
dy
will on that account go to work offensively, if the advantage of surprise i=
s
sufficiently great to make it expedient; and the party who is the last to b=
e
ready can only then in some measure compensate for the disadvantage which
threatens him by the advantages of the defensive.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, it must be looked upon in general as an advantage for the
offensive, that he can make that good use of being the first in the field w=
hich
has been noticed in the third book; only this general advantage is not an
absolute necessity in every case.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, we imagine to ourselves a defensive, such as it should be, w=
e
must suppose it with every possible preparation of all means, with an army =
fit
for, and inured to, war, with a general who does not wait for his adversary
with anxiety from an embarrassing feeling of uncertainty, but from his own =
free
choice, with cool presence of mind, with fortresses which do not dread a si=
ege,
and lastly, with a loyal people who fear the enemy as little as he fears th=
em.
With such attributes the defensive will act no such contemptible part in
opposition to the offensive, and the latter will not appear such an easy an=
d
certain form of war, as it does in the gloomy imaginations of those who can
only see in the offensive courage, strength of will, and energy; in the
defensive, helplessness and apathy.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap70"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>Extent of the Means of Defence</h=
3>

<p>
We have shown in the second and third chapters of this book how the defence=
 has
a natural advantage in the employment of those things,
which,=E2=80=94irrespective of the absolute strength and qualities of the
combatant force,=E2=80=94influence the tactical as well as the strategic re=
sult,
namely, the advantage of ground, sudden attack, attack from several directi=
ons
(converging form of attack), the assistance of the theatre of war, support =
of
the people, and the utilising great moral forces. We think it useful now to
cast again a glance over the extent of the means which are at command of th=
e
defensive in particular, and which are to be regarded as the columns of the
different orders of architecture in his edifice.
</p>

<h4>
1.=E2=80=94Landwehr (Militia).
</h4>

<p>
This force has been used in modern times to combat the enemy on foreign soi=
l;
and it is not to be denied that its organisation in many states, for instan=
ce
in Prussia, is of such a kind, that it may almost be regarded as part of th=
e
standing army, therefore it does not belong to the defensive exclusively. A=
t
the same time, we must not overlook the fact, that the very great use made =
of
it in 1813-14-15 was the result of defensive war; that it is organised in v=
ery
few places to the same degree as in Prussia, and that always when its
organisation falls below the level of complete efficiency, it is better sui=
ted
for the defensive than for the offensive. But besides that, there always li=
es
in the idea of a militia the notion of a very extensive more or less volunt=
ary
co-operation of the whole mass of the people in support of the war, with al=
l
their physical powers, as well as with their feelings, and a ready sacrific=
e of
all they possess. The more its organisation deviates from this, so much the
more the force thus created will become a standing army under another name,=
 and
the more it will have the advantages of such a force; but it will also lose=
 in
proportion the advantages which belong properly to the militia, those of be=
ing
a force, the limits of which are undefined, and capable of being easily
increased by appealing to the feelings and patriotism of the people. In the=
se
things lies the essence of a militia; in its organisation, latitude must be
allowed for this co-operation of the whole people; if we seek to obtain
something extraordinary from a militia, we are only following a shadow.
</p>

<p>
But now the close relationship between this essence of a militia system, an=
d
the conception of the defensive, is not to be denied, neither can it be den=
ied
that such a militia will always belong more to the defensive form than to t=
he
offensive, and that it will manifest chiefly in the defensive, those effect=
s
through which it surpasses the attack.
</p>

<h4>
2.=E2=80=94Fortresses.
</h4>

<p>
The assistance afforded by fortresses to the offensive does not extend beyo=
nd
what is given by those close upon the frontiers, and is only feeble in
influence; the assistance which the defensive can derive from this reaches
further into the heart of the country, and therefore more of them can be
brought into use, and their utility itself differs in the degree of its
intensity. A fortress which is made the object of a regular siege, and hold=
s
out, is naturally of more considerable weight in the scales of war, than on=
e
which by the strength of its works merely forbids the idea of its capture, =
and
therefore neither occupies nor consumes any of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces.

<h4>
3.=E2=80=94The People.
</h4>

<p>
Although the influence of a single inhabitant of the theatre of war on the
course of the war in most cases is not more perceptible than the co-operati=
on
of a drop of water in a whole river, still even in cases where there is no =
such
thing as a general rising of the people, the <i>total influence</i> of the
inhabitants of a country in war is anything but imperceptible. Every thing =
goes
on easier in our own country, provided it is not opposed by the general fee=
ling
of the population. All contributions great and small, are only yielded to t=
he
enemy under the compulsion of direct force; that operation must be undertak=
en
by the troops, and cost the employment of many men as well as great exertio=
ns.
The defensive receives all he wants, if not always voluntarily, as in cases=
 of
enthusiastic devotion, still through the long-used channels of submission t=
o
the state on the part of the citizens, which has become second nature, and
which besides that, is enforced by the terrors of the law with which the ar=
my
has nothing to do. But the spontaneous co-operation of the people proceedin=
g
from true attachment is in all cases most important, as it never fails in a=
ll
those points where service can be rendered without any sacrifice. We shall =
only
notice one point, which is of the highest importance in war, that is
<i>intelligence</i>, not so much special, great and important information
through persons employed, as that respecting the innumerable little matters=
 in
connection with which the daily service of an army is carried on in
uncertainty, and with regard to which a good understanding with the inhabit=
ants
gives the defensive a general advantage.
</p>

<p>
If we ascend from this quite general and never failing beneficial influence=
, up
to special cases in which the populace begins to take part in the war, and =
then
further up to the highest degree, where as in Spain, the war, as regards it=
s
leading events is chiefly a war carried on by the people themselves, we may=
 see
that we have here virtually a new power rather than a manifestation of
increased cooperation on the part of the people, and therefore that=E2=80=

</p>

<h4>
4.=E2=80=94The National Armament,
</h4>

<p>
or general call to arms, may be considered as a particular means of defence=
.
</p>

<h4>
5.=E2=80=94Allies.
</h4>

<p>
Finally, we may further reckon <i>allies</i> as the last support of the
defensive. Naturally we do not mean ordinary allies, which the assailant ma=
y
likewise have; we speak of those <i>essentially interested in maintaining</=
i>
the integrity of the country. If for instance we look at the various states
composing Europe at the present time, we find (without speaking of a
systematically regulated balance of power and interests, as that does not
exist, and therefore is often with justice disputed, still, unquestionably)
that the great and small states and interests of nations are interwoven wit=
h
each other in a most diversified and changeable manner, each of these point=
s of
intersection forms a binding knot, for in it the direction of the one gives
equilibrium to the direction of the other; by all these knots therefore,
evidently a more or less compact connection of the whole will be formed, an=
d
this general connection must be partially overturned by every change. In th=
is
manner the whole relations of all states to each other serve rather to pres=
erve
the stability of the whole than to produce changes, that is to say, <i>this
tendency</i> to stability exists in general.
</p>

<p>
This we conceive to be the true notion of a balance of power, and in this s=
ense
it will always of itself come into existence, wherever there are extensive
connections between civilised states.
</p>

<p>
How far this tendency of the general interests to the maintenance of the
existing state of things is efficient is another question; at all events we=
 can
conceive some changes in the relations of single states to each other, whic=
h
promote this efficiency of the whole, and others which obstruct it. In the
first case they are efforts to perfect the political balance, and as these =
have
the same tendency as the universal interests, they will also be supported b=
y
the majority of these interests. But in the other case, they are of an abno=
rmal
nature, undue activity on the part of some single states, real maladies; st=
ill
that these should make their appearance in a whole with so little cohesion =
as
an assemblage of great and little states is not to be wondered at, for we s=
ee
the same in that marvellously organised whole, the natural world.
</p>

<p>
If in answer we are reminded of instances in history where single states ha=
ve
effected important changes, solely for their own benefit, without any effor=
t on
the part of the whole to prevent the same, or cases where a single state ha=
s
been able to raise itself so much above others as to become almost the arbi=
ter
of the whole,=E2=80=94then our answer is that these examples by no means pr=
ove
that a tendency of the interests of the whole in favour of stability does n=
ot
exist, they only show that its action was not powerful enough at the moment=
.
The effort towards an object is a different thing from the motion towards i=
t.
At the same time it is anything but a nullity, of which we have the best
exemplification in the dynamics of the heavens.
</p>

<p>
We say, the tendency of equilibrium is to the maintenance of the existing
state, whereby we certainly assume that rest, that is equilibrium, existed =
in
this state; for where that has been already disturbed, tension has already
commenced, and there the equilibrium may certainly also tend to a change. B=
ut
if we look to the nature of the thing, this change can only affect some few
separate states, never the majority, and therefore it is certain that the
preservation of the latter is supported and secured through the collective
interests of the whole=E2=80=94certain also that each single state which ha=
s not
against it a tension of the whole will have more interest in favour of its
defence than opposition to it.
</p>

<p>
Whoever laughs at these reflections as utopian dreams, does so at the expen=
se
of philosophical truth. Although we may learn from it the relations which t=
he
essential elements of things bear to each other, it would be rash to attemp=
t to
deduce laws from the same by which each individual case should be governed
without regard to any accidental disturbing influences. But when a person, =
in
the words of a great writer, =E2=80=9C<i>never rises above anecdote</i>,=E2=
=80=9D
builds all history on it, begins always with the most individual points, wi=
th
the climaxes of events, and only goes down just so deep as he finds a motiv=
e
for doing, and therefore never reaches to the lowest foundation of the
predominant general relations, his opinion will never have any value beyond=
 the
one case, and to him, that which philosophy proves to be applicable to case=
s in
general, will only appear a dream.
</p>

<p>
Without that general striving for rest and the maintenance of the existing
condition of things, a number of civilised states could not long live quiet=
ly
side by side; they must necessarily become fused into one. Therefore, as Eu=
rope
has existed in its present state for more than a thousand years, we can onl=
y
regard the fact as a result of that tendency of the collective interests; a=
nd
if the protection afforded by the whole has not in every instance proved st=
rong
enough to preserve the independence of each individual state, such exceptio=
ns
are to be regarded as irregularities in the life of the whole, which have n=
ot
destroyed that life, but have themselves been mastered by it.
</p>

<p>
It would be superfluous to go over the mass of events in which changes whic=
h
would have disturbed the balance too much have been prevented or reversed b=
y
the opposition more or less openly declared of other states. They will be s=
een
by the most cursory glance at history. We only wish to say a few words abou=
t a
case which is always on the lips of those who ridicule the idea of a politi=
cal
balance, and because it appears specially applicable here as a case in whic=
h an
unoffending state, acting on the defensive, succumbed without receiving any
foreign aid. We allude to Poland. That a state of eight millions of inhabit=
ants
should disappear, should be divided amongst three others without a sword be=
ing
drawn by any of the rest of the European states, appears, at first sight, a
fact which either proves conclusively the general inefficiency of the polit=
ical
balance, or at least shows that it is inefficient to a very great extent in
some instances. That a state of such extent should disappear, a prey to oth=
ers,
and those already the most powerful (Russia and Austria), appears such a ve=
ry
extreme case that it will be said, if an event of this description could no=
t
rouse the collective interests of all free states, then the efficient actio=
n
which this collective interest should display for the benefit of individual
states is imaginary. But we still maintain that a single case, however
striking, does not negative the general truth, and we assert next that the
downfall of Poland is also not so unaccountable as may at first sight appea=
r.
Was Poland really to be regarded as a European state, as a homogeneous memb=
er
of the community of nations in Europe? No! It was a Tartar state, which ins=
tead
of being located, like the Tartars of the Crimea, on the Black Sea, on the
confines of the territory inhabited by the European community, had its
habitation in the midst of that community on the Vistula. We neither desire=
 by
this to speak disrespectfully of the Poles, nor to justify the partition of
their country, but only to look at things as they really are. For a hundred
years this country had ceased to play any independent part in European
politics, and had been only an apple of discord for the others. It was
impossible that for a continuance it could maintain itself amongst the othe=
rs
with its state and constitution unaltered: an essential alteration in its
Tartar nature would have been the work of not less than half, perhaps a who=
le
century, supposing the chief men of that nation had been in favour of it. B=
ut
these men were far too thorough Tartars to wish any such change. Their
turbulent political condition, and their unbounded levity went hand in hand=
,
and so they tumbled into the abyss. Long before the partition of Poland the
Russians had become quite at home there, the idea of its being an independe=
nt
state, with boundaries of its own, had ceased, and nothing is more certain =
than
that Poland, if it had not been partitioned, must have become a Russian
province. If this had not been so, and if Poland had been a state capable o=
f
making a defence, the three powers would not so readily have proceeded to i=
ts
partition, and those powers most interested in maintaining its integrity, l=
ike
France, Sweden and Turkey, would have been able to co-operate in a very
different manner towards its preservation. But if the maintenance of a stat=
e is
entirely dependent on external support, then certainly too much is asked.
</p>

<p>
The partition of Poland had been talked of frequently for a hundred years, =
and
for that time the country had been not like a private house, but like a pub=
lic
road, on which foreign armies were constantly jostling one another. Was it =
the
business of other states to put a stop to this; were they constantly to kee=
p
the sword drawn to preserve the political inviolability of the Polish front=
ier?
That would have been to demand a moral impossibility. Poland was at this ti=
me
politically little better than an uninhabited steppe; and as it is impossib=
le
that defenceless steppes, lying in the midst of other countries should be
guarded for ever from invasion, therefore it was impossible to preserve the
integrity of this state, as it was called. For all these reasons there is a=
s
little to cause wonder in the noiseless downfall of Poland as in the silent
conquest of the Crimean Tartars; the Turks had a greater interest in uphold=
ing
the latter than any European state had in preserving the independence of
Poland, but they saw that it would be a vain effort to try to protect a
defenceless steppe.=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
We return to our subject, and think we have proved that the defensive in
general may count more on foreign aid than the offensive; he may reckon the
more certainly on it in proportion as his existence is of importance to oth=
ers,
that is to say, the sounder and more vigorous his political and military
condition.
</p>

<p>
Of course the subjects which have been here enumerated as means properly
belonging to the defensive will not be at the command of each particular
defensive. Sometimes one, sometimes another, may be wanting; but they all
belong to the idea of the defensive as a whole.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap71"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>Mutual Action and Reaction of At=
tack and Defence</h3>

<p>
We shall now consider attack and defence separately, as far as they can be
separated from each other. We commence with the defensive for the following
reasons:=E2=80=94It is certainly very natural and necessary to base the rul=
es for
the defence upon those of the offensive, and <i>vice vers=C3=A2;</i> but on=
e of the
two must still have a third point of departure, if the whole chain of ideas=
 is
to have a beginning, that is, to be possible. The first question concerns t=
his
point.
</p>

<p>
If we reflect upon the commencement of war philosophically, the conception =
of
war properly does not originate with the <i>offensive</i>, as that form has=
 for
its absolute object, not so much <i>fighting</i> as the <i>taking possessio=
n of
something.</i> The idea of war arises first by the <i>defensive</i>, for th=
at
form has the battle for its direct object, as warding off and fighting plai=
nly
are one and the same. The warding off is directed entirely against the atta=
ck;
therefore supposes it, necessarily; but the attack is not directed against =
the
warding off; it is directed upon something else=E2=80=94the <i>taking
possession;</i> consequently does not presuppose the warding off. It lies,
therefore, in the nature of things, that the party who first brings the ele=
ment
of war into action, the party from whose point of view two opposite parties=
 are
first conceived, also establishes the first laws of war, and that party is =
the
<i>defender</i>. We are not speaking of any individual case; we are only
dealing with a general, an abstract case, which theory imagines in order to
determine the course it is to take.
</p>

<p>
By this we now know where to look for this fixed point, outside and indepen=
dent
of the reciprocal effect of attack and defence, and that it is in the
defensive.
</p>

<p>
If this is a logical consequence, the defensive must have motives of action=
,
even when as yet he knows nothing of the intentions of the offensive; and t=
hese
motives of action must determine the organisation of the means of fighting.=
 On
the other hand, as long as the offensive knows nothing of the plans of his
adversary, there are no motives of action for him, no grounds for the
application of his military means. He can do nothing more than take these m=
eans
along with him, that is, take possession by means of his army. And thus it =
is
also in point of fact; for to carry about the apparatus of war is not to us=
e
it; and the offensive who takes such things with him, on the quite general
supposition that he may require to use them, and who, instead of taking
possession of a country by official functionaries and proclamations, does s=
o
with an army, has not as yet committed, properly speaking, any act of warfa=
re;
but the defensive who both collects his apparatus of war, and disposes of i=
t
with a view to fighting, is the first to exercise an act which really accor=
ds
with the conception of war.
</p>

<p>
The second question is now: what is theoretically the nature of the motives
which must arise in the mind of the defensive first, before the attack itse=
lf
is thought of? Plainly the advance made with a view to taking possession, w=
hich
we have imagined extraneous to the war, but which is the foundation of the
opening chapter. The defence is to oppose this advance; therefore in idea w=
e
must connect this advance with the land (country); and thus arise the first
most general measures of the defensive. When these are once established, th=
en
upon them the application of the offensive is founded, and from a considera=
tion
of the means which the offensive then applies, new principles again of defe=
nce
are derived. Now here is the reciprocal effect which theory can follow in i=
ts
inquiry, as long as it finds the fresh results which are produced are worth
examination.
</p>

<p>
This little analysis was necessary in order to give more clearness and
stability to what follows, such as it is; it is not made for the field of
battle, neither is it for the generals of the future; it is only for the ar=
my
of theorists, who have made a great deal too light of the subject hitherto.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap72"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Methods of Resistance</h3>

<p>
The conception of the defence is warding off; in this warding off lies the
state of expectance, and this state of expectance we have taken as the chie=
f
characteristic of the defence, and at the same time as its principal advant=
age.
</p>

<p>
But as the defensive in war cannot be a state of endurance, therefore this
state of expectation is only a relative, not an absolute state; the subject=
s
with which this waiting for is connected are, as regards space, either the
country, or the theatre of war, or the position, and, as regards time, the =
war,
the campaign, or the battle. That these subjects are no immutable units, bu=
t
only the centres of certain limited regions, which run into one another and=
 are
blended together, we know; but in practical life we must often be contented
only to group things together, not rigidly to separate them; and these
conceptions have, in the real world itself, sufficient distinctness to be m=
ade
use of as centres round which we may group other ideas.
</p>

<p>
A defence of the country, therefore, only waits for attack on the country; =
a
defence of a theatre of war an attack on the theatre of war; and the defenc=
e of
a position the attack of that position. Every positive, and consequently mo=
re
or less offensive, kind of action which the defensive uses after the above
period of waiting for, does not negative the idea of the continuance of the
defensive; for the state of expectation, which is the chief sign of the sam=
e,
and its chief advantage, has been realised.
</p>

<p>
The conception of war, campaign, and battle, in relation to time, are coupl=
ed
respectively with the ideas of country, theatre of war, and position, and o=
n
that account they have the same relations to the present subject.
</p>

<p>
The defensive consists, therefore, of two heterogeneous parts, the state of
expectancy and that of action. By having referred the first to a definite
subject, and therefore given it precedence of action, we have made it possi=
ble
to connect the two into one whole. But an act of the defensive, especially =
a
considerable one, such as a campaign or a whole war, does not, as regards t=
ime,
consist of two great halves, the first the state of mere expectation, the
second entirely of a state of action; it is a state of alternation between =
the
two, in which the state of expectation can be traced through the whole act =
of
the defensive like a continuous thread.
</p>

<p>
We give to this state of expectation so much importance simply because it i=
s
demanded by the nature of the thing. In preceding theories of war it has
certainly never been brought forward as an independent conception, but in
reality it has always served as a guide, although often unobserved. It is s=
uch
a fundamental part of the whole act of war, that the one without the other
appears almost impossible; and we shall therefore often have occasion to re=
cur
to it hereafter by calling attention to its effects in the dynamic action o=
f
the powers called into play.
</p>

<p>
For the present we shall employ ourselves in explaining how the principle o=
f
the state of expectation runs through the act of defence, and what are the
successive stages in the defence itself which have their origin in this sta=
te.
</p>

<p>
In order to establish our ideas on subjects of a more simple kind, we shall
defer the defence of a country, a subject on which a very great diversity o=
f
political influences exercises a powerful effect, until we come to the Book=
 on
the Plan of War; and as on the other hand, the defensive act in a position =
or
in a battle is matter of tactics, which only forms a starting point for
strategic action as a <i>whole</i>, we shall take the defence of a <i>theat=
re,
of war</i> as being the subject, in which we can best show the relations of=
 the
defensive.
</p>

<p>
We have said, that the state of expectation and of action=E2=80=94which las=
t is
always a counterstroke, therefore a reaction=E2=80=94are both essential par=
ts of
the defensive; for without the first, there would be no defensive, without =
the
second no war. This view led us before to the idea of the defensive being
nothing but the <i>stronger form of war, in order the more certainly to con=
quer
the enemy;</i> this idea we must adhere to throughout, partly because it al=
one
saves us in the end from absurdity, partly, because the more vividly it is
impressed on the mind, so much the greater is the energy it imparts to the
whole act of the defensive.
</p>

<p>
If therefore we should make a distinction between the reaction, constitutin=
g
the second element of the defensive, and the other element which consists i=
n
reality in the repulse only of the enemy;=E2=80=94if we should look at expu=
lsion
from the country, from the theatre of war, in such a light as to see in it
alone the <i>necessary thing</i> by itself, the ultimate object beyond the
attainment of which our efforts should not be carried, and on the other han=
d,
regard the possibility of a reaction carried still further, and <i>passing =
into
the real strategic attack</i>, as a subject foreign to and of no consequenc=
e to
the defence,=E2=80=94such a view would be <i>in opposition to</i> the natur=
e of
the idea above represented, and therefore we cannot look upon this distinct=
ion
as really existing, and we must adhere to our assertion, that the idea of
<i>revenge</i> must always be at the bottom of every defensive; for otherwi=
se,
however much damage might be occasioned to the enemy, by a successful issue=
 of
the first reaction, there would always be a deficiency in the necessary bal=
ance
of the dynamic relations of the attack and defence.
</p>

<p>
We say, then, the defensive is the more powerful form of making war, in ord=
er
to overcome the enemy more easily, and we leave to circumstances to determi=
ne
whether this victory over the object against which the defence was commence=
d is
sufficient or not.
</p>

<p>
But as the defensive is inseparable from the idea of the state of expectati=
on,
that object, <i>the defeat of the enemy</i>, only exists conditionally, tha=
t
is, only if the offensive takes place; and otherwise (that is, if the offen=
sive
stroke does not follow) of course the defensive is contented with the
maintenance of its possessions; this maintenance is therefore its object in=
 the
state of expectation, that is, its immediate object; and it is only as long=
 as
it contents itself with this more modest end, that it preserves the advanta=
ges
of the stronger form of war.
</p>

<p>
If we suppose an army with its theatre of war intended for defence, the def=
ence
may be made as follows:
</p>

<p>
1. By attacking the enemy the moment he enters the theatre of war. (Mollwit=
z,
Hohenfriedberg).
</p>

<p>
2. By taking up a position close on the frontier, and waiting till the enem=
y
appears with the intention of attacking it, in order then to attack him
(Czaslau, Soor, Rosbach). Plainly this second mode of proceeding, partakes =
more
of endurance, we =E2=80=9Cwait for=E2=80=9D longer; and although the <i>tim=
e</i>
gained by it as compared with that gained in the first, may be very little,=
 or
none at all if the enemy=E2=80=99s attack actually takes place, still, the =
battle
which in the first case was certain, is in the second much less certain,
perhaps the enemy may not be able to make up his mind to attack; the advant=
age
of the =E2=80=9Cwaiting for,=E2=80=9D is then at once greater.
</p>

<p>
3. By the army in such position not only awaiting the decision of the enemy=
 to
fight a battle, that is his appearance in front of the position, but also
waiting to be actually assaulted (in order to keep to the same general,
Bunzelwitz). In such case, we fight a regular defensive battle, which howev=
er,
as we have before said, may include offensive movements with one or more pa=
rts
of the army. Here also, as before, the gain of time does not come into
consideration, but the determination of the enemy is put to a new proof; ma=
ny a
one has advanced to the attack, and at the last moment, or after one attemp=
t
given it up, finding the position of the enemy too strong.
</p>

<p>
4. By the army transferring its defence to the heart of the country. The ob=
ject
of retreating into the interior is to cause a diminution in the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
strength, and to wait until its effects are such that his forward march is =
of
itself discontinued, or at least until the resistance which we can offer hi=
m at
the end of his career is such as he can no longer overcome.
</p>

<p>
This case is exhibited in the simplest and plainest manner, when the defens=
ive
can leave one or more of his fortresses behind him, which the offensive is
obliged to besiege or blockade. It is clear in itself, how much his forces =
must
be weakened in this way, and what a chance there is of an opportunity for t=
he
defensive to attack at some point with superior forces.
</p>

<p>
But even when there are no fortresses, a retreat into the interior of the
country may procure by degrees for the defender that necessary equilibrium =
or
that superiority which was wanting to him on the frontier; for every forwar=
d
movement in the strategic attack lessens its force, partly absolutely, part=
ly
through the separation of forces which becomes necessary, of which we shall=
 say
more under the head of the =E2=80=9CAttack.=E2=80=9D We anticipate this tru=
th here
as we consider it as a fact sufficiently exemplified in all wars.
</p>

<p>
Now in this fourth case the gain of time is to be looked upon as the princi=
pal
point of all. If the assailant lays siege to our fortresses, we have time t=
ill
their probable fall, (which may be some weeks or in some cases months); but=
 if
the weakening, that is the expenditure, of the force of the attack is cause=
d by
the advance, and the garrisoning or occupation of certain points, therefore
merely through the length of the assailant=E2=80=99s march, then the time g=
ained
in most cases becomes greater, and our action is not so much restricted in
point of time.
</p>

<p>
Besides the altered relations between offensive and defensive in regard to
power which is brought about at the end of this march, we must bring into
account in favour of the defensive an <i>increased</i> amount of the
<i>advantage</i> of the state of =E2=80=9Cwaiting for.=E2=80=9D Although th=
e
assailant by this advance may not in reality be weakened to such a degree t=
hat
he is unfit to attack our main body where he halts, still he will probably =
want
resolution to do so, for that is an act requiring more resolution in the
position in which he is now placed, than would have sufficed when operation=
s
had not extended beyond the frontier: partly, because the powers are weaken=
ed,
and no longer in fresh vigour, while the danger is increased; partly, becau=
se
with an irresolute commander the possession of that portion of the country
which has been obtained is often sufficient to do away with all idea of a
battle, because he either really believes or assumes as a pretext, that it =
is
no longer necessary. By the offensive thus declining to attack, the defensi=
ve
certainly does not acquire, as he would on the frontier, a sufficient resul=
t of
a negative kind, but still there is a great gain of time.
</p>

<p>
It is plain that, in all the four methods indicated, the defensive has the
benefit of the ground or country, and likewise that he can by that means br=
ing
into cooperation his fortresses and the people; moreover these efficient
principles increase at each fresh stage of the defence, for they are a chie=
f
means of bringing about the weakening of the enemy=E2=80=99s force in the f=
ourth
stage. Now as the advantages of the =E2=80=9Cstate of expectation=E2=80=9D =
increase
in the same direction, therefore it follows of itself that these stages are=
 to
be regarded as a real intensifying of the defence, and that this form of wa=
r
always gains in strength the more it differs from the offensive. We are not
afraid on this account of any one accusing us of holding the opinion that t=
he
most passive defence would therefore be the best. The action of resistance =
is
not weakened at each new stage, it is only <i>delayed, postponed</i>. But t=
he
assertion that a stouter resistance can be offered in a strong judiciously
entrenched position, and also that when the enemy has exhausted his strengt=
h in
fruitless efforts against such a position a more effective counterstroke ma=
y be
levelled at him, is surely not unreasonable. Without the advantage of posit=
ion
Daun would not have gained the victory at Kollin, and as Frederick the Grea=
t
only brought off 18,000 men from the field of battle, if Daun had pursued h=
im
with more energy the victory might have been one of the most brilliant in
military history.
</p>

<p>
We therefore maintain, that at each new stage of the defensive the
preponderance, or more correctly speaking, the counterpoise increases in fa=
vour
of the defensive, and consequently there is also a gain in power for the
counterstroke.
</p>

<p>
Now are these advantages of the increasing force of the defensive to be had=
 for
nothing? By no means, for the sacrifice with which they are purchased incre=
ases
in the same proportion.
</p>

<p>
If we wait for the enemy within our own theatre of war, however near the bo=
rder
of our territory the decision takes place, still this theatre of war is ent=
ered
by the enemy, which must entail a sacrifice on our part; whereas, had we ma=
de
the attack, this disadvantage would have fallen on the enemy. If we do not
proceed at once to meet the enemy and attack him, our loss will be the grea=
ter,
and the extent of the country which the enemy will overrun, as well as the =
time
which he requires to reach our position, will continually increase. If we w=
ish
to give battle on the defensive, and we therefore leave its determination a=
nd
the choice of time for it to the enemy, then perhaps he may remain for some
time in occupation of the territory which he has taken, and the time which
through his deferred decision we are allowed to gain will in that manner be
paid for by us. The sacrifices which must be made become still more burdens=
ome
if a retreat into the heart of the country takes place.
</p>

<p>
But all these sacrifices on the part of the defensive, at most only occasio=
n
him in general a loss of power which merely diminishes his military force
<i>indirectly</i>, therefore, at a later period, and not directly, and ofte=
n so
indirectly that its effect is hardly felt at all. The defensive, therefore,
strengthens himself for the present moment at the expense of the future, th=
at
is to say, he borrows, as every one must who is too poor for the circumstan=
ces
in which he is placed.
</p>

<p>
Now, if we would examine the result of these different forms of resistance,=
 we
must look to the <i>object of the aggression</i>. This is, to obtain posses=
sion
of our theatre of war, or, at least, of an important part of it, for under =
the
conception of the whole, at least the greater part must be understood, as t=
he
possession of a strip of territory few miles in extent is, as a rule, of no
real consequence in strategy. As long, therefore, as the aggressor is not i=
n
possession of this, that is, as long as from fear of our force he has eithe=
r
not yet advanced to the attack of the theatre of war, or has not sought to =
find
us in our position, or has declined the combat we offer, the object of the
defence is fulfilled, and the effects of the measures taken for the defensi=
ve
have therefore been successful. At the same time this result is only a
<i>negative one</i>, which certainly cannot directly give the force for a r=
eal
counterstroke. But it may give it <i>indirectly</i>, that is to say, it is =
on
the way to do so; for the time which elapses <i>the aggression loses</i>, a=
nd
every loss of time is a disadvantage, and must weaken in some way the party=
 who
suffers the loss.
</p>

<p>
Therefore in the first three stages of the defensive, that is, if it takes
place on the frontier, <i>the non-decision is already a result in favour of=
 the
defensive.</i>
</p>

<p>
But it is not so with the fourth.
</p>

<p>
If the enemy lays siege to our fortresses we must relieve them in time, to =
do
this we must therefore bring about the decision by positive action.
</p>

<p>
This is likewise the case if the enemy follows us into the interior of the
country without besieging any of our places. Certainly in this case we have
more time; we can wait until the enemy=E2=80=99s weakness is extreme, but s=
till
it is always an indispensable condition that we are at last to act. The ene=
my
is now, perhaps, in possession of the whole territory which was the object =
of
his aggression, but it is only lent to him; the tension continues, and the
decision is yet pending. As long as the defensive is gaining strength and t=
he
aggressor daily becoming weaker, the postponement of the decision is in the
interest of the former: but as soon as the culminating point of this
progressive advantage has arrived, as it must do, were it only by the ultim=
ate
influence of the general loss to which the offensive has exposed himself, i=
t is
time for the defender to proceed to action, and bring on a solution, and th=
e
advantage of the =E2=80=9Cwaiting for=E2=80=9D may be considered as complet=
ely
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
There can naturally be no point of time fixed generally at which this happe=
ns,
for it is determined by a multitude of circumstances and relations; but it =
may
be observed that the winter is usually a natural turning point. If we canno=
t
prevent the enemy from wintering in the territory which he has seized, then=
, as
a rule, it must be looked upon as given up. We have only, however, to call =
to
mind Torres Vedras, to see that this is no general rule.
</p>

<p>
What is now the solution generally?
</p>

<p>
We have always supposed it in our observations in the form of a battle; but=
 in
reality, this is not necessary, for a number of combinations of battles wit=
h
separate corps may be imagined, which may bring about a change of affairs,
either because they have really ended with bloodshed, or because their prob=
able
result makes the retreat of the enemy necessary.
</p>

<p>
Upon the theatre of war itself there can be no other solution; that is a
necessary consequence of our view of war; for, in fact, even if an
enemy=E2=80=99s army, merely from want of provisions, commences his retreat=
,
still it takes place from the state of restraint in which our sword holds h=
im;
if our army was not in the way he would soon be able to provision his force=
s.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, even at the end of his aggressive course, when the enemy is
suffering the heavy penalty of his attack, when detachments, hunger, and
sickness have weakened and worn him out, it is still always the dread of ou=
r
sword which causes him to turn about, and allow everything to go on again a=
s
usual. But nevertheless, there is a great difference between such a solutio=
n
and one which takes place on the frontier.
</p>

<p>
In the latter case our arms only were opposed to his to keep him in check, =
or
carry destruction into his ranks; but at the end of the aggressive career t=
he
enemy=E2=80=99s forces, by their own exertions, are half destroyed, by whic=
h our
arms acquire a totally different value, and therefore, although they are th=
e
final they are not the only means which have produced the solution. This
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s forces in the advance prepares the solut=
ion,
and may do so to this extent, that the mere possibility of a reaction on ou=
r
part may cause the retreat, consequently a reversal of the situation of
affairs. In this case, therefore, we can practically ascribe the solution t=
o
nothing else than the efforts made in the advance. Now, in point of fact we
shall find no case in which the sword of the defensive has not co-operated;
but, for the practical view, it is important to distinguish which of the tw=
o
principles is the predominating one.
</p>

<p>
In this sense we think we may say that there is a double solution in the
defensive, consequently a double kind of reaction, according as the aggress=
or
is ruined by the <i>sword of the defensive</i>, or <i>by his own efforts</i=
>.
</p>

<p>
That the first kind of solution predominates in the first three steps of th=
e
defence, the second in the fourth, is evident in itself; and the latter wil=
l,
in most cases, only come to pass by the retreat being carried deep into the
heart of the country, and nothing but the prospect of that result can be a
sufficient motive for such a retreat, considering the great sacrifices whic=
h it
must cost.
</p>

<p>
We have, therefore, ascertained that there are two different principles of
defence; there are cases in military history where they each appear as sepa=
rate
and distinct as it is possible for an elementary conception to appear in
practical life. When Frederick the Great attacked the Austrians at
Hohenfriedberg, just as they were descending from the Silesian mountains, t=
heir
force could not have been weakened in any sensible manner by detachments or
fatigue; when, on the other hand, Wellington, in his entrenched camp at Tor=
res
Vedras, waited till hunger, and the severity of the weather, had reduced
Massena=E2=80=99s army to such extremities that they commenced to retreat o=
f
themselves, the sword of the defensive party had no share in the weakening =
of
the enemy=E2=80=99s army. In other cases, in which they are combined with e=
ach
other in a variety of ways, still, one of them distinctly predominates. Thi=
s
was the case in the year 1812. In that celebrated campaign such a number of
bloody encounters took place as might, under other circumstances, have suff=
iced
for a most complete decision by the sword; nevertheless, there is hardly an=
y
campaign in which we can so plainly see how the aggressor may be ruined by =
his
own efforts. Of the 300,000 men composing the French centre only about 90,0=
00
reached Moscow; not more than 13,000 were detached; consequently there had =
been
a loss of 197,000 men, and certainly not a third of that loss can be put to
account of battles.
</p>

<p>
All campaigns which are remarkable for temporising, as it is called, like t=
hose
of the famous Fabius Cunctator, have been calculated chiefly on the destruc=
tion
of the enemy by his own efforts. This principle has been the leading one in
many campaigns without that point being almost ever mentioned; and it is on=
ly
when we disregard the specious reasoning of historians, and look at things
clearly with our own eyes, that we are led to this real cause of many a
solution.
</p>

<p>
By this we believe we have unravelled sufficiently those ideas which lie at=
 the
root of the defensive, and that in the two great kinds of defence we have s=
hown
plainly and made intelligible how the principle of the waiting for runs thr=
ough
the whole system and connects itself with positive action in such a manner
that, sooner or later, action does take place, and that then the advantage =
of
the attitude of waiting for appears to be exhausted.
</p>

<p>
We think, now, that in this way we have gone over and brought into view
everything comprised in the province of the defensive. At the same time, th=
ere
are subjects of sufficient importance in themselves to form separate chapte=
rs,
that is, points for consideration in themselves, and these we must also stu=
dy;
for example, the nature and influence of fortified places, entrenched camps=
,
defence of mountains and rivers, operations against the flank, etc., etc. W=
e
shall treat of them in subsequent chapters, but none of these things lie
outside of the preceding sequence of ideas; they are only to be regarded as=
 a
closer application of it to locality and circumstances. That order of ideas=
 has
been deduced from the conception of the defensive, and from its relation to=
 the
offensive; we have connected these simple ideas with reality, and therefore
shown the way by which we may return again from the reality to those simple
ideas, and obtain firm ground, and not be forced in reasoning to take refug=
e on
points of support which themselves vanish in the air.
</p>

<p>
But resistance by the sword may wear such an altered appearance, assume suc=
h a
different character, through the multiplicity of ways of combining battles,
especially in cases where these are not actually realised, but become effec=
tual
merely through their possibility, that we might incline to the opinion that
there must be some other efficient active principle still to be discovered;
between the sanguinary defeat in a simple battle, and the effects of strate=
gic
combinations which do not bring the thing nearly so far as actual combat, t=
here
seems such a difference, that it is necessary to suppose some fresh force,
something in the same way as astronomers have decided on the existence of o=
ther
planets from the great space between Mars and Jupiter.
</p>

<p>
If the assailant finds the defender in a strong position which he thinks he
cannot take, or behind a large river which he thinks he cannot cross, or ev=
en
if he fears that by advancing further he will not be able to subsist his ar=
my,
in all these cases it is nothing but the sword of the defensive which produ=
ces
the effect; for it is the fear of being conquered by this sword, either in =
a
great battle or at some specially important points, which compels the aggre=
ssor
to stop, only he will either not admit that at all, or does not admit it in=
 a
straightforward way.
</p>

<p>
Now even if it is granted that, where there has been a decision without
bloodshed, the combat merely <i>offered</i>, but not accepted, has been the
ultimate cause of the decision, it will still be thought that in such cases=
 the
really effectual principle is the <i>strategic combination of</i> these com=
bats
and not their tactical decision, and that this superiority of the strategic
combination could only have been thought of because there are other defensi=
ve
means which may be considered besides an actual appeal to the sword. We adm=
it
this, and it brings us just to the point we wished to arrive at, which is a=
s
follows: if the tactical result of a battle must be the <i>foundation</i> o=
f
all strategic combinations, then it is always possible and to be feared tha=
t
the assailant may lay hold of this principle, and above all things direct h=
is
efforts to be superior in the hour of decision, in order to baffle the
strategic combination; and that therefore this strategic combination can
<i>never be regarded as something all-sufficient in itself;</i> that it onl=
y
has a value when either on one ground or another we can look forward to the
tactical solution without any misgivings. In order to make ourselves
intelligible in a few words, we shall merely call to our readers=E2=80=99
recollection how such a general as Buonaparte marched without hesitation
through the whole web of his opponents=E2=80=99 strategic plans, to seek fo=
r the
battle itself, because he had no doubts as to its issue. Where, therefore,
strategy had not directed its whole effort to ensure a preponderance over h=
im
in this battle, where it engaged in finer (feebler) plans, there it was ren=
t
asunder like a cobweb. But a general like Daun might be checked by such
measures; it would therefore be folly to offer Buonaparte and his army what=
 the
Prussian army of the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War dared to offer Daun and his
contemporaries. Why?=E2=80=94Because Buonaparte knew right well that all de=
pended
on the tactical issue, and made certain of gaining it; whereas with Daun it=
 was
very different in both respects.
</p>

<p>
<i>On this account</i> we hold it therefore to be serviceable to show that
every strategic combination rests only upon the tactical results, and that
these are everywhere, in the bloody as well as in the bloodless solution, t=
he
real fundamental grounds of the ultimate decision. It is only if we have no
reason to fear that decision, whether on account of the character or the
situation of the enemy, or on account of the moral and physical equality of=
 the
two armies, or on account of our own superiority=E2=80=94it is only then th=
at we
can expect something from strategic combinations in themselves without batt=
les.
</p>

<p>
Now if a great many campaigns are to be found within the compass of militar=
y
history in which the assailant gives up the offensive without any blood bei=
ng
spilt in fight, in which, therefore, strategic combinations show themselves
effectual to that degree, this may lead to the idea that these combinations
have at least great inherent force in themselves, and might in general deci=
de
the affair alone, where too great a preponderance in the tactical results i=
s
not supposed on the side of the aggressor. To this we answer that, if the
question is about things which have their origin in the theatre of war, and
consequently belong to the war itself, this idea is also equally false; and=
 we
add that the cause of the failure of most attacks is to be found in the hig=
her,
the political relations of war.
</p>

<p>
The general relations out of which a war springs, and which naturally
constitute its foundation, determine also its character; on this subject we
shall have more to say hereafter, in treating of the plan of a war. But the=
se
general relations have converted most wars into half-and-half things, into
which real hostility has to force its way through such a conflict of intere=
sts,
that it is only a very weak element at the last. This effect must naturally
show itself chiefly and with most force on the side of the offensive, <i>th=
e
side of positive action</i>. One cannot therefore wonder if such a
short-winded, consumptive attack is brought to a standstill by the touch of=
 a
finger. Against a weak resolution so fettered by a thousand considerations,
that it has hardly any existence, a mere show of resistance is often enough=
.
</p>

<p>
It is not the number of unassailable positions in all directions, not the
formidable look of the dark mountain masses encamped round the theatre of w=
ar,
or the broad river which passes through it, not the ease with which certain
combinations of battles can effectually paralyse the muscle which should st=
rike
the blow against us=E2=80=94none of these things are the true causes of the
numerous successes which the defensive gains on bloodless fields; the cause
lies in the weakness of the will with which the assailant puts forward his
hesitating feet.
</p>

<p>
These counteracting influences may and ought to be taken into consideration=
,
but they should only be looked upon in their true light, and their effects
should not be ascribed to other things, namely the things of which alone we=
 are
now treating. We must not omit to point out in an emphatic manner how easil=
y
military history in this respect may become a perpetual liar and deceiver i=
f
criticism is not careful about taking a correct point of view.
</p>

<p>
Let us now consider, in what we may call their ordinary form, the many
offensive campaigns which have miscarried without a bloody solution.
</p>

<p>
The assailant advances into the enemy=E2=80=99s country, drives back his op=
ponent
a little way, but finds it too serious a matter to bring on a decisive batt=
le.
He therefore remains standing opposite to him; acts as if he had made a
conquest, and had nothing else to do but to protect it; as if it was the
enemy=E2=80=99s business to seek the battle, as if he offered it to him dai=
ly,
etc., etc. These are the <i>representations</i> with which the commander
deludes his army, his government, the world, even himself. But the truth is=
,
that he finds the enemy in a position too strong for him. We do not now spe=
ak
of a case where an aggressor does not proceed with his attack because he ca=
n
make no use of a victory, because at the end of his first bound he has not
enough impulsive force left to begin another. Such a case supposes an attac=
k
which has been successful, a real conquest; but we have here in view the ca=
se
where an assailant sticks fast half way to his intended conquest.
</p>

<p>
He is now waiting to take advantage of favourable circumstances, of which
favourable circumstances there is in general no prospect, for the aggressio=
n
now intended shows at once that there is no better prospect from the future
than from the present; it is, therefore, a further illusion. If now, as is
commonly the case, the undertaking is in connection with other simultaneous
operations, then what they do not want to do themselves is transferred to o=
ther
shoulders, and their own inactivity is ascribed to want of support and prop=
er
co-operation. Insurmountable obstacles are talked of, and motives in
justification are discovered in the most confused and subtil considerations=
.
Thus the forces of the assailant are wasted away in inactivity, or rather i=
n a
partial activity, destitute of any utility. The defensive gains time, the
greatest gain to him; bad weather arrives, and the aggression ends by the
return of the aggressor to winter quarters in his own theatre of war.
</p>

<p>
A tissue of false representations thus passes into history in place of the
simple real ground of absence of any result, namely <i>fear of the
enemy=E2=80=99s sword</i>. When criticism takes up such a campaign, it wear=
ies
itself in the discussion of a number of motives and counter-motives, which =
give
no satisfactory result, because they all dwindle into vapour, and we have n=
ot
descended to the real foundation of the truth. The opposition through which=
 the
elementary energy of war, and therefore of the offensive in particular, bec=
omes
weakened, lies for the most part in the relations and views of states, and
these are always concealed from the world, from the mass of the people
belonging to the state, as well as from the army, and very often from the
general-in-chief. No one will account for his faint-heartedness by the
admission that he feared he could not attain the desired object with the fo=
rce
at his disposal, or that new enemies would be roused, or that he did not wi=
sh
to make his allies too powerful, etc. Such things are hushed up; but as
occurrences have to be placed before the world in a presentable form, there=
fore
the commander is obliged, either on his own account or on that of his
government to pass off a tissue of fictitious motives. This ever-recurring
deception in military dialectics has ossified into systems in theory, which=
, of
course, are equally devoid of truth. Theory can never be deduced from the
essence of things except by following the simple thread of cause and effect=
, as
we have tried to do.
</p>

<p>
If we look at military history with this feeling of suspicion, then a great
parade of mere words about offensive and defensive collapses, and the simpl=
e
idea of it, which we have given, comes forward of itself. We believe it
therefore to be applicable to the whole domain of the defensive, and that w=
e
must adhere closely to it in order to obtain that clear view of the mass of
events by which alone we can form correct judgments.
</p>

<p>
We have still to inquire into the question of the employment of these diffe=
rent
forms of defence.
</p>

<p>
As they are merely gradations of the same which must be purchased by a high=
er
sacrifice, corresponding to the increased intensity of the form, there woul=
d
seem to be sufficient in that view to indicate always to the general which =
he
should choose, provided there are no other circumstances which interfere. H=
e
would, in fact, choose that form which appeared sufficient to give his forc=
e
the requisite degree of defensive power and no more, that there might be no
unnecessary waste of his force. But we must not overlook the circumstance t=
hat
the room given for choice amongst these different forms is generally very
circumscribed, because other circumstances which must be attended to
necessarily urge a preference for one or other of them. For a retreat into =
the
interior of the country a considerable superficial space is required, or su=
ch a
condition of things as existed in Portugal (1810), where one ally (England)
gave support in rear, and another (Spain) with its wide territory, consider=
ably
diminished the impulsive force of the enemy. The position of the fortresses
more on the frontier or more in the interior may likewise decide for or aga=
inst
such a plan; but still more the nature of the country and ground, the
character, habits, and feelings of the inhabitants. The choice between an
offensive or defensive battle may be decided by the plans of the enemy, by =
the
peculiar qualities of both armies and their generals; lastly, the possessio=
n of
an excellent position or line of defence, or the want of them may determine=
 for
one or the other;=E2=80=94in short, at the bare mention of these things, we=
 can
perceive that the choice of the form of defensive must in many cases be
determined more by them than by the mere relative strength of the armies. A=
s we
shall hereafter enter more into detail on the more important subjects which
have just been touched upon, the influence which they must have upon the ch=
oice
will then develop itself more distinctly, and in the end the whole will be
methodised in the Book on Plans of Wars and Campaigns.
</p>

<p>
But this influence will not, in general, be decisive unless the inequality =
in
the strength of the opposing armies is trifling; in the opposite case (as i=
n
the generality of cases), the relation of the numerical strength will be
decisive. There is ample proof, in military history, that it has done so
heretofore, and that without the chain of reasoning by which it has been
brought out here; therefore in a manner intuitively by <i>mere tact of
judgment</i>, like most things that happen in war. It was the same general =
who
at the head of the same army, and on the same theatre of war, fought the ba=
ttle
of Hohenfriedberg, and at another time took up the camp of Bunzelwitz.
Therefore even Frederick the Great, a general above all inclined to the
offensive as regards the battle, saw himself compelled at last, by a great
disproportion of force, to resort to a real defensive position; and Buonapa=
rte,
who was once in the habit of falling on his enemy like a wild boar, have we=
 not
seen him, when the proportion of force turned against him, in August and
September, 1813, turn himself hither and thither as if he had been pent up =
in a
cage, instead of rushing forward recklessly upon some one of his adversarie=

And in October of the same year, when the disproportion reached its climax,
have we not seen him at Leipsic, seeking shelter in the angle formed by the
Parth, the Elster, and Pleiss, as it were waiting for his enemy in the corn=
er

We cannot omit to observe, that from this chapter, more than from any other=

<h3><a name=3D"chap73"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>Defensive Battle</h3>

<p>
We have said, in the preceding chapter, that the defender, in his defensive=
,
would make use of a battle, technically speaking, of a purely offensive
character, if, at the moment the enemy invades his theatre of war, he march=
es
against him and attacks him; but that he might also wait for the appearance=
 of
the enemy in his front, and then pass over to the attack; in which case als=
o
the battle tactically would be again an offensive battle, although in a
modified form; and lastly, that he might wait till the enemy attacked his
position, and then oppose him both by holding a particular spot, and by
offensive action with portions of his force. In all this we may imagine sev=
eral
different gradations and shades, deviating always more from the principle o=
f a
positive counterstroke, and passing into that of the defence of a spot of
ground. We cannot here enter on the subject of how far this should be carri=
ed,
and which is the most advantageous proportion of the two elements of offens=
ive
and defensive, as regards the winning a decisive victory. But we maintain t=
hat
when such a result is desired, the offensive part of the battle should neve=
r be
completely omitted, and we are convinced that all the effects of a decisive
victory may and must be produced by this offensive part, just as well as in=
 a
purely tactical offensive battle.
</p>

<p>
In the same manner as the field of battle is only a point in strategy, the
duration of a battle is only, strategically, an instant of time, and the en=
d
and result, not the course of a battle, constitutes a strategic quantity.
</p>

<p>
Now, if it is true that a complete victory may result from the offensive
elements which lie in every defensive battle, then there would be no
fundamental difference between an offensive and a defensive battle, as far =
as
regards strategic combinations; we are indeed convinced that this is so, bu=
t
the thing wears a different appearance. In order to fix the subject more
distinctly in the eye, to make our view clear and thereby remove the appear=
ance
now referred to, we shall sketch, hastily, the picture of a defensive battl=
e,
such as we imagine it.
</p>

<p>
The defensive waits the attack in a position; for this he has selected prop=
er
ground, and turned it to the best account, that is, he has made himself wel=
l
acquainted with the locality, thrown up strong entrenchments at some of the
most important points, opened and levelled communications, constructed
batteries, fortified villages, and looked out places where he can draw up h=
is
masses under cover, etc., etc., etc. Whilst the forces on both sides are
consuming each other at the different points where they come into contact, =
the
advantage of a front more or less strong, the approach to which is made
difficult by one or more parallel trenches or other obstacles, or also by t=
he
influence of some strong commanding points, enables him with a <i>small par=
t of
his force</i> to destroy <i>great numbers of the enemy</i> at every stage o=
f
the defence up to the heart of the position. The points of support which he=
 has
given his wings secure him from any sudden attack from several quarters; th=
e
covered ground which he has chosen for his masses makes the enemy cautious,
indeed timid, and affords the defensive the means of diminishing by partial=
 and
successful attacks the general backward movement which goes on as the comba=
t
becomes gradually concentrated within narrower limits. The defender therefo=
re
casts a contented look at the battle as it burns in a moderate blaze before
him;=E2=80=94but he does not reckon that his resistance in front can last f=
or
ever;=E2=80=94he does not think his flanks impregnable;=E2=80=94he does not=
 expect
that the whole course of the battle will be changed by the successful charg=
e of
a few battalions or squadrons. His position is <i>deep</i>, for each part i=
n
the scale of gradation of the order of battle, from the division down to th=
e
battalion, has its reserve for unforeseen events, and for a renewal of the
fight; and at the same time an important mass, one fifth to a quarter of th=
e
whole, is kept quite in the rear out of the battle, so far back as to be qu=
ite
out of fire, and if possible so far as to be beyond the circuitous line by
which the enemy might attempt to turn either flank. With this corps he inte=
nds
to cover his flanks from wider and greater turning movements, secure himsel=
f
against unforeseen events, and in the latter stage of the battle, when the
assailant=E2=80=99s plan is fully developed, when the most of his troops ha=
ve
been brought into action, he will throw this mass on a part of the
enemy=E2=80=99s army, and open at that part of the field a smaller offensiv=
e
battle on his own part, using all the elements of attack, such as charges,
surprise, turning movements, and by means of this pressure against the cent=
re
of gravity of the battle, now only resting on a point, make the whole recoi=
l.
</p>

<p>
This is the normal idea which we have formed of a defensive battle, based o=
n
the tactics of the present day. In this battle the general turning movement
made by the assailant in order to assist his attack, and at the same time w=
ith
a view to make the results of victory more complete, is replied to by a par=
tial
turning movement on the part of the defensive, that is, by the turning of t=
hat
part of the assailant=E2=80=99s force used by him in the attempt to turn. T=
his
partial movement may be supposed sufficient to destroy the effect of the
enemy=E2=80=99s attempt, but it cannot lead to a like general enveloping of=
 the
assailant=E2=80=99s army; and there will always be a distinction in the fea=
tures
of a victory on this account, that the side fighting an offensive battle
encircles the enemy=E2=80=99s army, and acts towards the centre of the same=
,
while the side fighting on the defensive acts more or less from the centre =
to
the circumference, in the direction of the radii.
</p>

<p>
On the field of battle itself, and in the first stages of the pursuit, the
enveloping form must always be considered the most effectual; we do not mea=
n on
account of its form generally, we only mean in the event of its being carri=
ed
out to such an extreme as to limit very much the enemy=E2=80=99s means of r=
etreat
during the battle. But it is just against this extreme point that the
enemy=E2=80=99s positive counter-effort is directed, and in many cases wher=
e this
effort is not sufficient to obtain a victory, it will at least suffice to
protect him from such an extreme as we allude to. But we must always admit =
that
this danger, namely, of having the line of retreat seriously contracted, is
particularly great in defensive battles, and if it cannot be guarded agains=
t,
the results in the battle itself, and in the first stage of the retreat are
thereby very much enhanced in favour of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
But as a rule this danger does not extend beyond the first stage of the
retreat, that is, until night-fall; on the following day enveloping is at a=
n
end, and both parties are again on an equality in this respect.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the defender may have lost his principal line of retreat, and
therefore be placed in a disadvantageous strategic situation for the future=
;
but in most cases the turning movement itself will be at an end, because it=
 was
only planned to suit the field of battle, and therefore cannot apply much
further. But what will take place, on the other hand, if the <i>defender</i=
> is
victorious? A division of the defeated force. This may facilitate the retre=
at
at the first moment, but <i>next day a concentration of all parts</i> is th=
e
one thing most needful. Now if the victory is a most decisive one, if the
defender pursues with great energy, this concentration will often become
impossible, and from this separation of the beaten force the worst conseque=
nces
may follow, which may go on step by step to a complete rout. If Buonaparte =
had
conquered at Leipsic, the allied army would have been completely cut in two=
,
which would have considerably lowered their relative strategic position. At
Dresden, although Buonaparte certainly did not fight a regular defensive
battle, the attack had the geometrical form of which we have been speaking,
that is, from the centre to the circumference; the embarrassment of the All=
ies
in consequence of their separation, is well known, an embarrassment from wh=
ich
they were only relieved by the victory on the Katzbach, the tidings of whic=
h
caused Buonaparte to return to Dresden with the Guard.
</p>

<p>
This battle on the Katzbach itself is a similar example. In it the defender=
, at
the last moment passes over to the offensive, and consequently operates on
diverging lines; the French corps were thus wedged asunder, and several day=
s
after, as the fruits of the victory, Puthod=E2=80=99s division fell into th=
e
hands of the Allies.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion we draw from this is, that if the assailant, by the concentr=
ic
form which is homogeneous to him, has the means of giving expansion to his
victory, on the other hand the defender also, by the divergent form which i=
s
homogeneous to the defence, acquires a a means of giving greater results to=
 his
victory than would be the case by a merely parallel position and perpendicu=
lar
attack, and we think that one means is at least as good as the other.
</p>

<p>
If in military history we rarely find such great victories resulting from t=
he
defensive battle as from the offensive, that proves nothing against our
assertion that the one is as well suited to produce victory as the other; t=
he
real cause is in the very different relations of the defender. The army act=
ing
on the defensive is generally the weaker of the two, not only in the amount=
 of
his forces, but also in every other respect; he either is, or thinks he is,=
 not
in a condition to follow up his victory with great results, and contents
himself with merely fending off the danger and saving the honour of his arm=
s.
That the defender by inferiority of force and other circumstances may be ti=
ed
down to that degree we do not dispute, but there is no doubt that this, whi=
ch
is only the consequence of a contingent necessity, has often been assumed t=
o be
the consequence of that part which every defender has to play: and thus in =
an
absurd manner it has become a prevalent view of the defensive that its batt=
les
should really be confined to warding off the attacks of the enemy, and not
directed to the destruction of the enemy. We hold this to be a prejudicial
error, a regular substitution of the form for the thing itself; and we main=
tain
unreservedly that in the form of war which we call <i>defence</i>, the vict=
ory
may not only be more probable, but may also attain the same magnitude and
efficacy as in the attack, and that this may be the case not only in the
<i>total result</i> of all the combats which constitute campaign, but also =
in
any <i>particular</i> battle, if the necessary degree of force and energy i=
s
not wanting.

<h3><a name=3D"chap74"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>Fortresses</h3>

<p>
Formerly, and up to the time of great standing armies, fortresses, that is
castles and fortified towns, were only built for the defence and protection=
 of
the inhabitants. The baron, if he saw himself pressed on all sides, took re=
fuge
in his castle to gain time and wait a more favourable moment; and towns sou=
ght
by their walls to keep off the passing hurricane of war. This simplest and =
most
natural object of fortresses did not continue to be the only one; the relat=
ion
which such a place acquired with regard to the whole country and to troops
acting here and there in the country soon gave these fortified points a wid=
er
importance, a signification which made itself felt beyond their walls, and
contributed essentially to the conquest or occupation of the country, to th=
e
successful or unsuccessful issue of the whole contest, and in this manner t=
hey
even became a means of making war more of a connected whole. Thus fortresse=
s
acquired that strategic significance which for a time was regarded as so
important that it dictated the leading features of the plans of campaigns,
which were more directed to the taking of one or more fortresses than the
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s army in the field. Men reverted to the c=
ause
of the importance of these places, that is to the connection between a
fortified point, and the country, and the armies; and then thought that the=
y
could not be sufficiently particular or too philosophical in choosing the
points to be fortified. In these abstract objects the original one was almo=
st
lost sight of, and at length they came to the idea of fortresses without ei=
ther
towns or inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the times are past in which the mere enclosure of a plac=
e
with walls, without any military preparations, could keep a place dry durin=
g an
inundation of war sweeping over the whole country. Such a possibility reste=
d
partly on the division of nations formerly into small states, partly on the
periodical character of the incursions then in vogue, which had fixed and v=
ery
limited duration, almost in accordance with the seasons, as either the feud=
al
forces hastened home, or the pay for the condottieri used regularly to run
short. Since large standing armies, with powerful trains of artillery mow d=
own
the opposition of walls or ramparts as it were with a machine, neither town=
 nor
other small corporation has any longer an inclination to hazard all their m=
eans
only to be taken a few weeks or months later, and then to be treated so muc=
h
the worse. Still less can it be the interest of an army to break itself up =
into
garrisons for a number of strong places, which may for a time retard the
progress of the enemy, but must in the end submit. We must always keep enou=
gh
forces, over and above those in garrison, to make us equal to the enemy in =
the
open field, unless we can depend on the arrival of an ally, who will reliev=
e
our strong places and set our army free. Consequently the number of fortres=
ses
has necessarily much diminished, and this has again led to the abandonment =
of
the idea of directly protecting the population and property in towns by
fortifications, and promoted the other idea of regarding the fortresses as =
an
indirect protection to the country, which they secure by their strategic
importance as knots which hold together the strategic web.
</p>

<p>
Such has been the course of ideas, not only in books but also in actual
experience, at the same time, as usually happens, it has been much more spu=
n
out in books.
</p>

<p>
Natural as was this tendency of things, still these ideas were carried out =
to
an extreme, and mere crotchets and fancies displaced the sound core of a
natural and urgent want. We shall look into these simple and important want=
s
when we enumerate the objects and conditions of fortresses all together; we
shall thereby advance from the simple to the more complicated, and in the
succeeding chapter we shall see what is to be deduced therefrom as to the
determination of the position and number of fortresses.
</p>

<p>
The efficacy of a fortress is plainly composed of two different elements, t=
he
passive and the active. By the first it shelters the place, and all that it
contains; by the other it possesses a certain influence over the adjacent
country, even beyond the range of its guns.
</p>

<p>
This active element consists in the attacks which the garrison may undertak=
e
upon every enemy who approaches within a certain distance. The larger the
garrison, so much the stronger numerically will be the detachments that may=
 be
employed on such expeditions, and the stronger such detachments the wider a=
s a
rule will be the range of their operations; from which it follows that the
sphere of the active influence of a great fortress is not only greater in
intensity but also more extensive than that of a small one. But the active
element itself is again, to a certain extent, of two kinds, consisting name=
ly
of enterprises of the garrison proper, and of enterprises which other bodie=
s of
troops, great and small, not belonging to the garrison but in co-operation =
with
it, may be able to carry out. For instance, corps which independently would=
 be
too weak to face the enemy, may, through the shelter which, in case of
necessity, the walls of a fortress afford them, be able to maintain themsel=
ves
in the country, and to a certain extent to command it.
</p>

<p>
The enterprises which the garrison of a fortress can venture to undertake a=
re
always somewhat restricted. Even in the case of large places and strong
garrisons, the bodies of troops which can be employed on such operations ar=
e
mostly inconsiderable as compared with the forces in the field, and their
average sphere of action seldom exceeds a couple of days=E2=80=99 marches. =
If the
fortress is small, the detachments it can send out are quite insignificant =
and
the range of their activity will generally be confined to the nearest villa=
ges.
But corps which do not belong to the garrison, and therefore are not under =
the
necessity of returning to the place, are thereby much more at liberty in th=
eir
movements, and by their means, if other circumstances are favourable, the
external zone of action of a fortress may be immensely extended. Therefore =
if
we speak of the active influence of fortresses in general terms, we must al=
ways
keep this feature of the same principally in view.
</p>

<p>
But even the smallest active element of the weakest garrison, is still
essential for the different objects which fortresses are destined to fulfil=
,
for strictly speaking even the most passive of all the functions of a fortr=
ess
(defence against attack) cannot be imagined exclusive of that active agency=
. At
the same time it is evident that amongst the different purposes which a
fortress may have to answer generally, or in this or that moment, the passi=
ve
element will be most required at one time, the active at another. The role
which a fortress is to fulfil may be perfectly simple, and the action of th=
e
place will in such case be to a certain extent direct; it may be partly
complicated, and the action then becomes more or less indirect. We shall
examine these subjects separately, commencing with the first; but at the ou=
tset
we must state that a fortress may be intended to answer several of these
purposes, perhaps all of them, either at once, or at least at different sta=
ges
of the war.
</p>

<p>
We say, therefore, that fortresses are great and most important supports of=
 the
defensive.
</p>

<p>
1. <i>As secure depots of stores of all kinds.</i> The assailant during his
aggression subsists his army from day to day; the defensive usually must ha=
ve
made preparations long beforehand, he need not therefore draw provisions
exclusively from the district he occupies, and which he no doubt desires to
spare. Storehouses are therefore for him a great necessity. The provisions =
of
all kinds which the aggressor possesses are in his rear as he advances, and=
 are
therefore exempt from the dangers of the theatre of war, while those of the
defensive are exposed to them. If these provisions of all kinds are not in
<i>fortified places</i>, then a most injurious effect on the operations in =
the
field is the consequence, and the most extended and compulsory positions of=
ten
become necessary in order to cover depots or sources of supply.
</p>

<p>
An army on the defensive without fortresses has a hundred vulnerable spots;=
 it
is a body without armour.
</p>

<p>
2. <i>As a protection to great and wealthy towns</i>. This purpose is close=
ly
allied to the first, for great and wealthy towns, especially commercial one=
s,
are the natural storehouses of an army; as such their possession and loss
affects the army directly. Besides this, it is also always worth while to
preserve this portion of the national wealth, partly on account of the
resources which they furnish directly, partly because, in negotiations for
peace, an important place is in itself a valuable weight thrown into the sc=
ale.
</p>

<p>
This use of fortresses has been too little regarded in modern times, and ye=
t it
is one of the most natural, and one which has a most powerful effect, and i=
s
the least liable to mistakes. If there was a country in which not only all
great and rich cities, but all populous places as well were fortified, and
defended by the inhabitants and the people belonging to the adjacent distri=
cts,
then by that means the expedition of military operation would be so much
reduced, and the people attacked would press with so great a part of their
whole weight in the scales, that the talent as well as the force of will of=
 the
enemy=E2=80=99s general would sink to nothing.
</p>

<p>
We just mention this ideal application of fortification to a country to do
justice to what we have just supposed to be the proper use of fortresses, a=
nd
that the importance of the <i>direct</i> protection which they afford may n=
ot
be overlooked for a moment; but in any other respect this idea will not aga=
in
interrupt our considerations, for amongst the whole number of fortresses th=
ere
must always be some which must be more strongly fortified than others, to s=
erve
as the real supports of the active army.
</p>

<p>
The purposes specified under 1 and 2 hardly call forth any other but the
passive action of fortresses.
</p>

<p>
3. <i>As real barriers</i>, they close the roads, and in most cases the riv=
ers,
on which they are situated.
</p>

<p>
It is not as easy as is generally supposed to find a practicable lateral ro=
ad
which passes round a fortress, for this turning must be made, not only out =
of
reach of the guns of this place, but also by a detour greater or less, to a=
void
sorties of the garrison.
</p>

<p>
If the country is in the least degree difficult, there are often delays
connected with the slightest deviation of the road which may cause the loss=
 of
a whole day=E2=80=99s march, and, if the road is much used, may become of g=
reat
importance.
</p>

<p>
How they may have an influence on enterprises by closing the navigation of =
a
river is clear in itself.
</p>

<p>
4. <i>As tactical points d=E2=80=99appui</i>. As the diameter of the zone c=
overed
by the fire of even a very inferior class of fortifications is usually some
leagues, fortresses may be considered always as the best points d=E2=80=99a=
ppui
for the flanks of a position. A lake of several miles long is certainly an
excellent support for the wing of an army, and yet a fortress of moderate s=
ize
is better. The flank does not require to rest close upon it, as the assaila=
nt,
for the sake of his retreat, would not throw himself between our flank and =
that
obstacle.
</p>

<p>
5. <i>As a station</i> (<i>or stage</i>). If fortresses are on the line of
communication of the defensive, as is generally the case, they serve as hal=
ting
places for all that passes up and down these lines. The chief danger to lin=
es
of communication is from irregular bands, whose action is always of the nat=
ure
of a shock. If a valuable convoy, on the approach of such a comet, can reac=
h a
fortress by hastening the march or quickly turning, it is saved, and may wa=
it
there till the danger is past. Further, all troops marching to or from the
army, after halting here for a a few days, are better able to hasten the
remainder of the march, and a halting day is just the time of greatest dang=
er.
In this way a fortress situated half way on a line of communication of 30 m=
iles
shortens the line in a manner one half.
</p>

<p>
6. <i>As places of refuge for weak or defeated corps.</i> Under the guns of=
 a
moderate sized fortress every corps is safe from the enemy=E2=80=99s blows,=
 even
if no entrenched camp is specially prepared for them. No doubt such a corps
must give up its further retreat if it waits too long; but this is no great
sacrifice in cases where a further retreat would only end in complete
destruction.
</p>

<p>
In many cases a fortress can ensure a few days=E2=80=99 halt without the re=
treat
being altogether stopped. For the slightly wounded and fugitives who preced=
e a
beaten army, it is especially suited as a place of refuge, where they can w=
ait
to rejoin their corps.
</p>

<p>
If Magdeburg had lain on the direct line of the Prussian retreat in 1806, a=
nd
if that line had not been already lost at Auerstadt, the army could easily =
have
halted for three or four days near that great fortress, and rallied and
reorganised itself. But even as it was it served as a rallying point for th=
e
remains of Hohenlohe=E2=80=99s corps, which there first resumed the appeara=
nce of
an army.
</p>

<p>
It is only by actual experience in war itself that the beneficial influence=
 of
fortresses close at hand in disastrous times can be rightly understood. The=
y
contain powder and arms, forage and bread, give covering to the sick, secur=
ity
to the sound, and recovery of sense to the panic-stricken. They are like an
hostelry in the desert.
</p>

<p>
In the four last named purposes it is evident that the active agency of
fortresses is called more into requisition.
</p>

<p>
7. <i>As a real shield against the enemy=E2=80=99s aggression.</i> Fortress=
es
which the defender leaves in his front break the stream of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
attack like blocks of ice. The enemy must at least invest them, and require=
s
for that, if the garrisons are brave and enterprising, perhaps double their
strength. But, besides, these garrisons may and do mostly consist in part o=
f
troops, who, although competent to duty in a garrison, are not fit for the
field=E2=80=94half trained militia, invalids, convalescents, armed citizens=
,
landsturm, etc. The enemy, therefore, in such case is perhaps weakened four
times more than we are.
</p>

<p>
This disproportionate weakening of the enemy=E2=80=99s power is the first a=
nd
most important but not the only advantage which a besieged fortress affords=
 by
its resistance. From the moment that the enemy crosses our line of fortress=
es,
all his movements become much more constrained; he is limited in his lines =
of
retreat, and must constantly attend to the direct covering of the sieges wh=
ich
he undertakes.
</p>

<p>
Here, therefore, fortresses co-operate with the defensive act in a most
extensive and decisive manner, and of all the objects that they can have, t=
his
may be regarded as the most important.
</p>

<p>
If this use of fortresses=E2=80=94far from being seen regularly repeating
itself=E2=80=94seldom comparatively occurs in military history, the cause i=
s to
be found in the character of most wars, this means being to a certain exten=
t
far too decisive and too thoroughly effectual for them, the explanation of
which we leave till hereafter.
</p>

<p>
In this use of fortresses it is chiefly their offensive power that is calle=
d
for, at least it is that by which their effectual action is chiefly produce=
d.
If a fortress was no more to an aggressor than a point which could not be
occupied by him, it might be an obstacle to him, but not to such a degree a=
s to
compel him to lay siege to it But as he cannot leave six, eight, or ten
thousand men to do as they like in his rear, he is obliged to invest the pl=
ace
with a sufficient force, and if he desires that this investment should not
continue to employ so large a detachment, he must convert the investment in=
to a
siege, and take the place. From the moment the siege commences, it is then
chiefly the passive efficacy of the fortress which comes into action.
</p>

<p>
All the destinations of fortresses which we have been hitherto considering =
are
fulfilled in a simple and mainly in a direct manner. On the other hand, in =
the
next two objects the method of action is more complicated.
</p>

<p>
8. <i>As a protection to extended cantonments.</i> That a moderate-sized
fortress closes the approach to cantonments lying behind it for a width of
three or four milesis a simple result of its existence; but how such a plac=
e
comes to have the honour of covering a line of cantonments fifteen or twent=
y
miles in length, which we find frequently spoken of in military history as =
a
fact=E2=80=94that requires investigation as far as it has really taken plac=
e, and
refutation so far as it may be mere illusion.
</p>

<p>
The following points offer themselves for consideration:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
(1.) That the place in itself blocks one of the main roads, and really cove=
rs a
breadth of three or four miles of country.
</p>

<p>
(2.) That it may be regarded as an exceptionally strong advanced post, or t=
hat
it affords a more complete observation of the country, to which may be adde=
d
facilities in the way of secret information through the ordinary relations =
of
civil life which exist between a great town and the adjacent districts It i=
s
natural that in a place of six, eight or ten thousand inhabitants, one shou=
ld
be able to learn more of what is going on in the neighbourhood than in a me=
re
village, the quarters of an ordinary outpost.
</p>

<p>
(3.) That smaller corps are appuyed on it, derive from it protection and
security, and from time to time can advance towards the enemy, it may be to
bring in intelligence, or, in case he attempts to turn the fortress, to
underdertake something against his rear; that therefore although a fortress=
,
cannot quit its place, still it may have the efficacy of an advanced corps
(Fifth Book, eighth Chapter).
</p>

<p>
(4.) That the defender, after assembling his corps, can take up his positio=
n at
a point directly behind this fortress, which the assailant cannot reach wit=
hout
becoming exposed to danger from the fortress in his rear.
</p>

<p>
No doubt every attack on a line of cantonments as such is to be taken in th=
e
sense of a surprise, or rather, we are only speaking here of that kind of
attack; now it is evident in itself that an attack by surprise accomplishes=
 its
effect in a much shorter space of time than a regular attack on a theatre o=
f
war. Therefore, although in the latter case, a fortress which is to be pass=
ed
by must necessarily be invested and kept in check, this investment will not=
 be
so indispensable in the case of a mere sudden attack on cantonments, and
therefore in the same proportion the fortress will be less an obstacle to t=
he
attack of the cantonments. That is true enough; also the cantonments lying =
at a
distance of six to eight miles from the fortress cannot be directly protect=
ed
by it; but the object of such a sudden attack does not consist alone in the
attack of a few cantonments. Until we reach the book on attack we cannot
describe circumstantially the real object of such a sudden attack and what =
may
be expected from it; but this much we may say at present, that its principa=
l
results are obtained, not by the actual attack on some isolated quarters, b=
ut
by the series of combats which the aggressor forces on single corps not in
proper order, and more bent upon hurrying to certain points than upon fight=
ing.
But this attack and pursuit will always be in a direction more or less towa=
rds
the centre of the enemy=E2=80=99s cantonments, and, therefore, an important
fortress lying before this centre will certainly prove a very great impedim=
ent
to the attack.
</p>

<p>
If we reflect on these four points in the whole of their effects, we see th=
at
an important fortress in a direct and in an indirect way certainly gives so=
me
security to a much greater extent of cantonments than we should think at fi=
rst
sight. =E2=80=9CSome security=E2=80=9D we say, for all these indirect agenc=
ies do
not render the advance of the enemy impossible; they only make it <i>more
difficult</i>, and a <i>more serious consideration;</i> consequently less
probable and less of a danger for the defensive. But that is also all that =
was
required, and all that should be understood in this case under the term
covering. The real direct security must be attained by means of outposts an=
d
the arrangement of the cantonments themselves.
</p>

<p>
There is, therefore, some truth in ascribing to a great fortress the capabi=
lity
of covering a wide extent of cantonments lying in rear of it; but it is als=
o
not to be denied that often in plans of real campaigns, but still oftener i=
n
historical works, we meet with vague and empty expressions, or illusory vie=
ws
in connection with this subject. For if that covering is only realised by t=
he
co-operation of several circumstances, if it then also only produces a
diminution of the danger, we can easily see that, in particular cases, thro=
ugh
special circumstances, above all, through the boldness of the enemy, this w=
hole
covering may prove an illusion, and therefore in actual war we must not con=
tent
ourselves with assuming hastily at once the efficacy of such and such a
fortress, but carefully examine and study each single case on its own merit=
s.
</p>

<p>
9. <i>As covering a province not occupied.</i> If during war province is ei=
ther
not occupied at all, or only occupied by an insufficient force, and likewis=
e
exposed more or less to incursions from flying columns, then a fortress, if=
 not
too unimportant in size, may be looked upon as a covering, or, if we prefer=
, as
a security for this province. As a security it may at all events be regarde=
d,
for an enemy cannot become master of the province until he has taken it, an=
d
that gives us time to hasten to its defence. But the actual covering can
certainly only be supposed very indirect, or as <i>not preperly belonging t=
o
it</i>. That is, the fortress by its active opposition can only in some mea=
sure
check the incursions of hostile bands. If this opposition is limited to mer=
ely
what the garrison can effect, then the result must be little indeed, for th=
e
garrisons of such places are generally weak and usually consist of infantry
only, and that not of the best quality. The idea gains a little more realit=
y if
small columns keep themselves in communication with the place, making it th=
eir
base and place of retreat in case of necessity.
</p>

<p>
10. <i>As the focus of a general arming of the nation.</i> Provisions, arms=
,
and munitions can never be supplied in a regular manner in a People=E2=80=
=99s
War; on the other hand, it is just in the very nature of such a war to do t=
he
best we can; in that way a thousand small sources furnishing means of
resistance are opened which otherwise might have remained unused; and it is
easy to see that a strong commodious fortress, as a great magazine of these
things, can well give to the whole defence more force and intensity, more
cohesion, and greater results.
</p>

<p>
Besides, a fortress is a place of refuge for wounded, the seat of the civil
functionaries, the treasury, the point of assembly for the greater enterpri=
ses,
etc., etc.; lastly, a nucleus of resistance which during the siege places t=
he
enemy=E2=80=99s force in a condition which facilitates and favours the atta=
cks of
national levies acting in conjunction.
</p>

<p>
11. <i>For the defence of rivers and mountains.</i> Nowhere can a fortress
answer so many purposes, undertake to play so many parts, as when it is
situated on a great river. It secures the passage at any time at that spot,=
 and
hinders that of the enemy for several miles each way, it commands the use o=
f
the river for commercial purposes, receives all ships within its walls, blo=
cks
bridges and roads, and helps the indirect defence of the river, that is, th=
e
defence by a position on the enemy=E2=80=99s side. It is evident that, by i=
ts
influence in so many ways, it very greatly facilitates the defence of the
river, and may be regarded as an essential part of that defence.
</p>

<p>
Fortresses in mountains are important in a similar manner. They there form =
the
knots of whole systems of roads, which have their commencement and terminat=
ion
at that spot; they thus command the whole country which is traversed by the=
se
roads, and they may be regarded as the true buttresses of the whole defensi=
ve
system.

<h3><a name=3D"chap75"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>Fortresses (<i>Continued</i>)</h3=
>

<p>
We have discussed the object of fortresses: now for their situation. At fir=
st
the subject seems very complicated, when we think of the diversity of objec=
ts,
each of which may again be modified by the locality; but such a view has ve=
ry
little foundation if we keep to the essence of the thing, and guard against
unnecessary subtilties.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that all these demands are at once satisfied, if, in those
districts of country which are to be regarded as the theatre of war, all th=
e
largest and richest towns on the great high roads connecting the two countr=
ies
with each other are fortified, more particularly those adjacent to harbours=
 and
bays of the sea, or situated on large rivers and in mountains. Great towns =
and
great roads always go hand in hand, and both have also a natural connection
with great rivers and the coasts of the sea, all these four conditions,
therefore, agree very well with each other, and give rise to no incongruity=
; on
the other hand, it is not the same with mountains, for large towns are seld=
om
found there. If, therefore, the position and direction of a mountain chain
makes it favourable to a defensive line, it is necessary to close its roads=
 and
passes by small forts, built for this purpose only, and at the least possib=
le
cost, the great outlay on works of fortification being reserved for the
important places of arms in the level country.
</p>

<p>
We have not yet noticed the frontiers of the state, nor said anything of th=
e
geometrical form of the whole system of fortresses, nor of the other
geographical points in connection with their situation, because we regard t=
he
objects above mentioned as the most essential, and are of opinion that in m=
any
cases they alone are sufficient, particularly in small states. But, at the =
same
time, other considerations may be admitted, and may be imperative in countr=
ies
of a greater superficial extent, which either have a great many important t=
owns
and roads, or, on the contrary, are almost without any, which are either ve=
ry
rich, and, possessing already many fortresses, still want new ones, or thos=
e
which, on the other hand, are very poor, and under the necessity of making =
a
few answer, in short, in cases where the number of fortresses does not
correspond with the number of important towns and roads which present
themselves, being either considerably greater or less.
</p>

<p>
We shall now cast a glance at the nature of such other considerations.
</p>

<p>
The chief questions which remain relate to
</p>

<p>
1. The choice of the principal roads, if the two countries are connected by
more roads than we wish to fortify.
</p>

<p>
2. Whether the fortresses are to be placed on the frontier only, or spread =
over
the country. Or,
</p>

<p>
3. Whether they shall be distributed uniformly, or in groups.
</p>

<p>
4. Circumstances relating to the geography of the country to which it is
necessary to pay attention.
</p>

<p>
A number of other points with respect to the geometrical form of the line o=
f
fortifications, such as whether they should be placed in a single line or i=
n
several lines, that is, whether they do more service when placed one behind
another, or side by side in line with each other; whether they should be
chequer-wise, or in a straight line; or whether they should take the form o=
f a
fortification itself, with salients and re-entering angles all these we loo=
k
upon as empty subtilties, that is, considerations so insignificant, that,
compared with the really important points, they are not worth notice; and w=
e
only mention them here because they are not merely treated of in many books=
,
but also a great deal more is made of this rubbish than it is worth.
</p>

<p>
As regards the first question, in order to place it in a clearer light we s=
hall
merely instance the relation of the south of Germany to France, that is, to=
 the
upper Rhine. If, without reference to the number of separate states composi=
ng
this district of country, we suppose it a whole which is to be fortified
strategically, much doubt will arise, for a great number of very fine roads
lead from the Rhine into the interior of Franconia, Bavaria and Austria.
Certainly, towns are not wanting which surpass others in size and importanc=
e,
as Nuremburg, Wurzburg, Ulm, Augsburg, and Munich; but if we are not dispos=
ed
to fortify all, there is no alternative but to make a selection. If, furthe=
r,
in accordance with our view, the fortification of the greatest and wealthie=
st
is held to be the principal thing, still it is not to be denied that, owing=
 to
the distance between Nuremburg and Munich, the first has a very different
strategic signification from the second; and therefore it always remains to=
 be
considered whether it would not be better, in place of Nuremburg, to fortif=
y
some other place in the neighbourhood of Munich, even if the place is one o=
f
less importance in itself.
</p>

<p>
As concerns the decision in such cases, that is, answering the first questi=
on,
we must refer to what has been said in the chapters on the general plan of
defence, and on the choice of points of attack. Wherever the most natural p=
oint
of attack is situated, there the defensive arrangements should be made by
preference.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, amongst a number of great roads leading from the enemy=E2=80=99s
country into ours, we should first of all fortify that which leads most
directly to the heart of our dominions, or that which, traversing fertile
provinces, or running parallel to navigable rivers, facilitates the
enemy=E2=80=99s undertaking, and then we may rest secure. The assailant the=
n
encounters these works, or should he resolve to pass them by, he will natur=
ally
offer a favourable opportunity for operations against his flank.
</p>

<p>
Vienna is the heart of South Germany, and plainly Munich or Augsburg, in
relation to France alone (Switzerland and Italy being therefore supposed
neutral) would be more efficient as a principal fortress than Nuremburg or
Wurzburg. But if, at the same time, we look at the roads leading from Italy
into Germany by Switzerland and the Tyrol, this will become still more evid=
ent,
because, in relation to these, Munich and Augsburg will always be places of
importance, whereas Wurzburg and Nuremburg are much the same, in this respe=
ct,
as if they did not exist.
</p>

<p>
We turn now to the second question Whether the fortresses should be placed =
on
the frontier, or distributed over the country? In the first place, we must
observe, that, as regards small states, this question is superfluous, for w=
hat
are called <i>strategic frontiers</i> coincide, in their case, nearly with =
the
whole country. The larger the state is supposed to be in the consideration =
of
this question, the plainer appears the necessity for its being answered.
</p>

<p>
The most natural answer is, that fortresses belong to the frontiers, for th=
ey
are to defend the state, and the state is defended as long as the frontiers=
 are
defended. This argument may be valid in the abstract, but the following
considerations will show that it is subject to very many modifications.
</p>

<p>
Every defence which is calculated chiefly on foreign assistance lays great
value on gaining time; it is not a vigorous counterstroke, but a slow
proceeding, in which the chief gain consists more in delay than in any
weakening of the enemy which is effected. But now it lies in the nature of =
the
thing that, supposing all other circumstances alike, fortresses which are
spread over the whole country, and include between them a very considerable
area of territory, will take longer to capture than those squeezed together=
 in
a close line on the frontier. Further, in all cases in which the object is =
to
overcome the enemy through the length of his communications, and the diffic=
ulty
of his existence therefore in countries which can chiefly reckon on this ki=
nd
of reaction, it would be a complete contradiction to have the defensive
preparations of this kind only on the frontier. Lastly, let us also remembe=
r
that, if circumstances will in any way allow of it, the fortification of th=
e
capital is a main point; that according to our principles the chief towns a=
nd
places of commerce in the provinces demand it likewise; that rivers passing
through the country, mountains, and other irregular features of ground, aff=
ord
advantages for new lines of defence; that many towns, through their strong
natural situation, invite fortification; moreover, that certain accessories=
 of
war, such as manufactories of arms, &amp;c., are better placed in the inter=
ior
of the country than on the frontier, and their value well entitles them to =
the
protection of works of fortification; then we see that there is always more=
 or
less occasion for the construction of fortresses in the interior of a count=
ry;
on this account we are of opinion, that although states which possess a gre=
at
number of fortresses are right in placing the greater number on the frontie=
r,
still it would be a great mistake if the interior of the country was left
entirely destitute of them. We think that this mistake has been made in a
remarkable degree in France. A great doubt may with reason arise if the bor=
der
provinces of a country contain no considerable towns, such towns lying furt=
her
back towards the interior, as is the case in South Germany in particular, w=
here
Swabia is almost destitute of great towns, whilst Bavaria contains a large
number. We do not hold it to be necessary to remove these doubts once for a=
ll
on general grounds, believing that in such cases, in order to arrive at a
solution, reasons derived from the particular situation must come into
consideration. Still we must call attention to the closing remarks in this
chapter.
</p>

<p>
The third question Whether fortresses should be disposed in groups, or more
equally distributed? will, if we reflect upon it, seldom arise; still we mu=
st
not, for that reason, set it down as a useless subtilty, because certainly =
a
group of two, three, or four fortresses, which are only a few days=E2=80=99=
 march
from a common centre, give that point and the army placed there such streng=
th,
that, if other conditions allowed of it, in some measure one would be very =
much
tempted to form such a strategic bastion.
</p>

<p>
The last point concerns the other geographical properties of the points to =
be
chosen. That fortresses on the sea, on streams and great rivers, and in
mountains, are doubly effective, has been already stated to be one of the
principal considerations; but there are a number of other points in connect=
ion
with fortresses to which regard must be paid.
</p>

<p>
If a fortress cannot lie on the river itself, it is better not to place it
near, but at a distance of ten or twelve miles from it; otherwise, the rive=
r
intersects, and lowers the value of the sphere of action of the fortress in=
 all
those points above mentioned.(*)
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Philippsburg was the pattern of a badly-placed fortress; it resembled a
fool standing with his nose close to a wall.
</p>

<p>
This is not the same in mountains, because there the movement of large or s=
mall
masses upon particular points is not restricted in the same degree as it is=
 by
a river. But fortresses on the enemy=E2=80=99s side of a mountain are not w=
ell
placed, because they are difficult to succour. If they are on our side, the
difficulty of laying siege to them is very great, as the mountains cut acro=
ss
the enemy=E2=80=99s line of communication. We give Olm=C3=BCtz, 1758, as an=
 example.
</p>

<p>
It is easily seen that impassable forests and marshes have a similar effect=
 to
that of rivers.
</p>

<p>
The question has been often raised as to whether towns situated in a very
difficult country are well or ill suited for fortresses. As they can be
fortified and defended at a small expense, or be made much stronger, often
impregnable, at an equal expenditure, and the services of a fortress are al=
ways
more passive than active, it does not seem necessary to attach much importa=
nce
to the objection that they can easily be blockaded.
</p>

<p>
If we now, in conclusion, cast a retrospective glance over our simple syste=
m of
fortification for a country, we may assert that it rests on comprehensive d=
ata,
lasting in their nature, and directly connected with the foundations of the
state itself, not on transient views on war, fashionable for a day; not on
imaginary strategic niceties, nor on requirements completely singular in
character an error which might be attended with irreparable consequences if
allowed to influence the construction of fortresses intended to last five
hundred, perhaps a thousand, years. Silberberg, in Silesia, built by Freder=
ick
the Great on one of the ridges of the Sudetics, has, from the complete
alteration in circumstances which has since taken place, lost almost entire=
ly
its importance and object, whilst Breslau, if it had been made a strong pla=
ce
of arms, and continued to be so, would have always maintained its value aga=
inst
the French, as well as against the Russians, Poles, and Austrians.
</p>

<p>
Our reader will not overlook the fact that these considerations are not rai=
sed
on the supposed case of a state providing itself with a set of new
fortifications; they would be useless if such was their object, as such a c=
ase
seldom, if ever, happens; but they may all arise at the designing of each
single fortification.
</p>

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap76"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>Defensive Position</h3>

<p>
Every position in which we accept battle, at the same time making use of th=
e
ground as a means of protection, is a <i>defensive position</i>, and it mak=
es
no difference in this respect whether we act more passively or more offensi=
vely
in the action. This follows from the general view of the defensive which we
have given.
</p>

<p>
Now we may also apply the term to every position in which an army whilst
marching to encounter the enemy would certainly accept battle if the latter
sought for it. In point of fact, most battles take place in this way, and i=
n
all the middle ages no other was ever thought of. That is, however, not the
kind of position of which we are now speaking; by far the greater number of
positions are of this kind, and the conception of a <i>position</i> in
contradistinction to a <i>camp taken up on the march</i> would suffice for
that. A position which is specially called a <i>defensive position</i> must
therefore have some other distinguishing characteristics.
</p>

<p>
In the decisions which take place in an ordinary position, the idea of time
evidently predominates; the armies march against each other in order to com=
e to
an engagement: the place is a subordinate point, all that is required from =
it
is that it should not be unsuitable. But in a real defensive position the i=
dea
of <i>place</i> predominates; the decision is to be realised on this
<i>spot</i>, or rather, chiefly <i>through</i> this spot. That is the only =
kind
of position we have here in view.
</p>

<p>
Now the connection of place is a double one; that is, in the first instance=
,
inasmuch as a force posted at this point exercises a certain influence upon=
 the
war in general; and next, inasmuch as the local features of the ground
contribute to the strength of the army and afford protection: in a word, a
strategic and a tactical connection.
</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, the term <i>defensive position</i> has its origin only i=
n
connection with tactics, for its connection with strategy, namely, that an =
army
posted at this point by its presence serves to defend the country, will als=
o
suit the case of an army acting offensively.
</p>

<p>
The strategic effect to be derived from a position cannot be shown complete=
ly
until hereafter, when we discuss the defence of a theatre of war; we shall
therefore only consider it here as far as can be done at present, and for t=
hat
end we must examine more closely the nature of two ideas which have a
similarity and are often mistaken for one another, that is, the <i>turning =
a
position</i>, and <i>the passing by it</i>.
</p>

<p>
The turning a position relates to its front, and is done either by an attac=
k
upon the side of the position or on its rear, or by acting against its line=
s of
retreat and communication.
</p>

<p>
The first of these, that is, an attack on flank or rear is tactical in its
nature. In our days in which the mobility of troops is so great, and all pl=
ans
of battles have more or less in view the turning or enveloping the enemy, e=
very
position must accordingly be adapted to meet such measures, and one to dese=
rve
the name of strong must, with a strong front, allow at least of good
combinations for battle on the sides and rear as well, in case of their bei=
ng
menaced. In this way a position will not become untenable by the enemy turn=
ing
it with a view to an attack on the flank or rear, as the battle which then
takes place was provided for in the choice of the position, and should ensu=
re
the defender all the advantages which he could expect from this position
generally.
</p>

<p>
If the position <i>is turned</i> by the enemy with a view to acting against=
 the
lines of retreat and communication, this is a <i>strategic</i> relation, an=
d
the question is how long the position can be maintained, and whether we can=
not
outbid the enemy by a scheme like his own, both these questions depend on t=
he
situation of the point (strategically), that is, chiefly on the relations o=
f
the lines of communication of both combatants. A good position should secur=
e to
the army on the defensive the advantage in this point. In any case the posi=
tion
will not be rendered of no effect in this way, as the enemy is neutralised =
by
the position when he is occupied by it in the manner supposed.
</p>

<p>
But if the assailant, without troubling himself about the existence of the =
army
awaiting his attack in a defensive position, advances with his main body by
another line in pursuit of his object, then he <i>passes by the position;</=
i>
and if he can do this with impunity, and really does it, he will immediatel=
y
enforce the abandonment of the position, consequently put an end to its
usefulness.
</p>

<p>
There is hardly any position in the world which, in the simple sense of the
words, cannot be passed by, for cases such as the isthmus of Perekop are so
rare that they are hardly worth attention. The impossibility of passing by =
must
therefore be understood as merely applying to the disadvantages in which th=
e
assailant would become involved if he set about such an operation. We shall
have a more fitting opportunity to state these disadvantages in the
twenty-seventh chapter; whether small or great, in every case they are the
equivalent of the tactical effect which the position is capable of producin=
g
but which has not been realised, and in common with it constitute the objec=
t of
the position.
</p>

<p>
From the preceding observations, therefore, two strategic properties of the
defensive position have resulted:
</p>

<p>
1. That it cannot be passed round.
</p>

<p>
2. That in the struggle for the lines of communication it gives the defende=
r
advantages.
</p>

<p>
Here we have to add two other strategic properties, namely=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
3. That the relation of the lines of communication may also have a favourab=
le
influence on the form of combat; and
</p>

<p>
4. That the general influence of the country is advantageous.
</p>

<p>
For the relation of the lines of communication has an influence not only up=
on
the possibility or impossibility of passing by a position or of cutting off=
 the
enemy=E2=80=99s supplies, but also on the whole course of the battle. An ob=
lique
line of retreat facilitates a tactical turning movement on the part of the
assailant, and paralyses our own tactical movements during the battle. But =
an
oblique position in relation to the lines of communication is often not the
fault of tactics but a consequence of a defective strategic point; it is, f=
or
example, not to be avoided when the road changes direction in the vicinity =
of
the position (Borodino, 1812); the assailant is then in such a position tha=
t he
can turn our line <i>without deviating from, his own perpendicular
disposition.</i>
</p>

<p>
Further, the aggressor has much greater freedom for tactical movement if he
commands several roads for his retreat whilst we are limited to one. In suc=
h
cases the tactical skill of the defensive will be exerted in vain to overco=
me
the disadvantageous influence resulting from the strategic relations.
</p>

<p>
Lastly as regards the fourth point, such a disadvantageous general influenc=
e
may predominate in the other characteristics of ground, that the most caref=
ul
choice, and the best use of tactical means, can do nothing to combat them.
Under such circumstances the chief points are as follows:
</p>

<p>
1. The defensive must particularly seek for the advantage of being able to
overlook his adversary, so that he may be able swiftly to throw himself upo=
n
him inside the limits of his position. It is only when the local difficulti=
es
of approach combine with these two conditions that the ground is really
favourable to the defensive.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, those points which are under the influence of commanding
ground are disadvantageous to him; also most positions in mountains (of whi=
ch
we shall speak more particularly in the chapters on mountain warfare). Furt=
her,
positions which rest one flank on mountains, for such a position certainly
makes the <i>passing by</i> more difficult, but facilitates a <i>turning
movement</i>. Of the same kind are all positions which have a mountain
immediately in their front, and generally all those which bear relation to =
the
description of ground above specified.
</p>

<p>
As an example of the opposite of these disadvantageous properties, we shall
only instance the case of a position which has a mountain in rear; from thi=
s so
many advantages result that it may be assumed in general to be one of the m=
ost
favourable of all positions for the defensive.
</p>

<p>
2. A country may correspond more or less to the character and composition o=
f an
army. A very numerous cavalry is a proper reason for seeking an open countr=
y.
Want of this arm, perhaps also of artillery, while we have at command a
courageous infantry inured to war, and acquainted with the country, make it
advisable to take advantage of a difficult, close country.
</p>

<p>
We do not here enter into particulars respecting the tactical relation whic=
h
the local features of a defensive position bear to the force which is to oc=
cupy
it. We only speak of the total result, as that only is a strategic quantity=
.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly a position in which an army is to await the full force of the
hostile attack, should give the troops such an important advantage of groun=
d as
may be considered a multiplier of its force. Where nature does much, but no=
t to
the full as much as we want, the art of entrenchment comes to our help. In =
this
way it happens not unfrequently that some parts become <i>unassailable</i>,=
 and
not unusually the whole is made so: plainly in this last case, the whole na=
ture
of the measure is changed. It is then no longer a battle under advantageous
conditions which we seek, and in this battle the issue of the campaign, but=
 an
issue without a battle. Whilst we occupy with our force an unassailable
position, we directly refuse the battle, and oblige our enemy to seek for a
solution in some other way.
</p>

<p>
We must, therefore, completely separate these two cases, and shall speak of=
 the
latter in the following chapter, under the title of a <i>strong position</i=
>.
</p>

<p>
But the defensive position with which we have now to do is nothing more tha=
n a
field of battle with the addition of advantages in our favour; and that it
should become a field of battle, the advantages in our favour must not be
<i>too great</i>. But now what degree of strength may such a position have?
Plainly more in proportion as our enemy is more determined on the attack, a=
nd
that depends on the nature of the individual case. Opposed to a Buonaparte,=
 we
may and should withdraw behind stronger ramparts than before a Daun or a
Schwartzenburg.
</p>

<p>
If certain portions of a position are unattackable, say the front, then tha=
t is
to be taken as a separate factor of its whole strength, for the forces not
required at that point are available for employment elsewhere; but we must =
not
omit to observe that whilst the enemy is kept completely off such impregnab=
le
points, the form of his attack assumes quite a different character, and we =
must
ascertain, in the first instance, how this alteration will suit our situati=
on.
</p>

<p>
For instance, to take up a position, as has often been done, so close behin=
d a
great river that it is to be looked upon as covering the front, is nothing =
else
but to make the river a point of support for the right or left flank; for t=
he
enemy is naturally obliged to cross further to the right or left, and canno=
t
attack without changing his front: the chief question, therefore, is what
advantages or disadvantages does that bring to us?
</p>

<p>
According to our opinion, a defensive position will come the nearer to the =
true
ideal of such a position the more its strength is hid from observation, and=
 the
more it is favourable to our surprising the enemy by our combinations in th=
e
battle. Just as we advisably endeavour to conceal from the enemy the whole
strength of our forces and our real intentions, so in the same way we shoul=
d
seek to conceal from the enemy the advantages which we expect to derive fro=
m
the form of the ground. This of course can only be done to a certain degree=
,
and requires, perhaps, a peculiar mode of proceeding, hitherto but little
attempted.
</p>

<p>
The vicinity of a considerable fortress, in whatever direction it may be,
confers on every position a great advantage over the enemy in the movement =
and
use of the forces belonging to it. By suitable field-works, the want of nat=
ural
strength at particular points may be remedied, and in that manner the great
features of the battle may be settled beforehand at will; these are the mea=
ns
of strengthening by art; if with these we combine a good selection of those
natural obstacles of ground which impede the effective action of the
enemy=E2=80=99s forces without making action absolutely impossible, if we t=
urn to
the best account the advantage we have over the enemy in knowing the ground=
,
which he does not, so that we succeed in concealing our movements better th=
an
he does his, and that we have a general superiority over him in unexpected
movements in the course of the battle, then from these advantages united, t=
here
may result in our favour an overpowering and decisive influence in connecti=
on
with the ground, under the power of which the enemy will succumb, without
knowing the real cause of his defeat. This is what we understand under
<i>defensive position</i>, and we consider it one of the greatest advantage=
s of
defensive war.
</p>

<p>
Leaving out of consideration particular circumstances, we may assume that a=
n
undulating, not too well, but still not too little, cultivated country affo=
rds
the most positions of this kind.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap77"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>Strong Positions and Entrenched=
 Camps</h3>

<p>
We have said in the preceding chapter that a position so strong through nat=
ure,
assisted by art, that it is unassailable, does not come under the meaning o=
f an
advantageous field of battle, but belongs to a peculiar class of things. We
shall in this chapter take a review of what constitutes the nature of this
peculiarity, and on account of the analogy between such positions and
fortresses, call them <i>strong positions</i>.
</p>

<p>
Merely by entrenchments alone they can hardly be formed, except as entrench=
ed
camps resting on fortresses; but still less are they to be found ready form=
ed
entirely by natural obstacles. Art usually lends a hand to assist nature, a=
nd
therefore they are frequently designated as <i>entrenched</i> camps or
positions. At the same time, that term may really be applied to any positio=
n
strengthened more or less by field works, which need have nothing in common
with the nature of the position we are now considering.
</p>

<p>
The object of a strong position is to make the force there stationed in poi=
nt
of fact unattackable, and by that means, either really to cover a certain s=
pace
directly, or only the troops which occupy that space in order then, through
them, in another way to effect the covering of the country indirectly. The
first was the signification of the <i>lines</i> of former times, for instan=
ce,
those on the French frontier; the latter, is that of <i>entrenched camps</i=
>
laid out near fortresses, and showing a front in every direction.
</p>

<p>
If, for instance, the front of a position is so strong by works and hindran=
ces
to approach that an attack is impossible, then the enemy is compelled to tu=
rn
it, to make his attack on a side of it or in rear. Now to prevent this bein=
g
easily done, <i>points d=E2=80=99appui</i> were sought for these lines, whi=
ch
should give them a certain degree of support on the side, such as the Rhine=
 and
the Vosges give the lines in Alsace. The longer the front of such a line th=
e
more easily it can be protected from being turned, because every movement t=
o
turn it is attended with danger to the side attempting the movement, the da=
nger
increasing in proportion as the required movement causes a greater deviatio=
n
from the normal direction of the attacking force. Therefore, a considerable
length of front, which can be made unassailable, and good flank-supports,
ensure the possibility of protecting a large space of territory directly fr=
om
hostile invasion: at least, that was the view in which works of this class
originated; that was the object of the lines in Alsace, with their right fl=
ank
on the Rhine and the left on the Vosges; and the lines in Flanders, fifteen
miles long, resting their right on the Scheldt and the fortress of Tournay,
their left on the sea.
</p>

<p>
But when we have not the advantages of such a long well-defended front, and
good flank-supports, if the country is to be held generally by a force well
entrenched, then that force (and its position) must be protected against be=
ing
turned by such an arrangement that it can show a front in every direction. =
But
then the idea of <i>a thoroughly covered tract of country</i> vanishes, for
such a position is only strategically a point which covers the force occupy=
ing
it, and thus secures to that force the power of keeping the field, that is =
to
say, <i>maintaining itself in the country</i>. Such a camp cannot be
<i>turned</i>, that is, cannot be attacked in flank or rear by reason of th=
ose
parts being weaker than its front, for it can show front in all directions,=
 and
is equally strong everywhere. But such a camp can be <i>passed by</i>, and =
that
much easier than a fortified line, because its extent amounts to nothing.
</p>

<p>
Entrenched camps connected with fortresses are in reality of this second ki=
nd,
for the object of them is to protect the troops assembled in them; but thei=
r
further strategic meaning, that is, the application of this protected force=
, is
somewhat different from that of other fortified camps.
</p>

<p>
Having given this explanation of the origin of these three different defens=
ive
means, we shall now proceed to consider the value of each of them separatel=
y,
under the heads of <i>strong lines, strong positions</i>, and <i>entrenched
camps resting on fortresses.</i>
</p>

<p>
1. <i>Lines</i>.=E2=80=94They are the worst kind of cordon war: the obstacl=
e
which they present to the aggressor is of no value at all unless they are
defended by a powerful fire; in themselves they are simply worthless. But n=
ow
the extent to which an army can furnish an effective fire is generally very
small in proportion to the extent of country to be defended; the lines can,
therefore, only be short, and consequently cover only a small extent of
country, or the army will not be able really to defend the lines at all poi=
nts.
In consequence of this, the idea was started of not occupying all points in=
 the
line, but only watching them, and defending them by means of strong reserve=
s,
in the same way as a small river may be defended; but this procedure is in
opposition to the nature of the means. If the natural obstacles of the grou=
nd
are so great that such a method of defence could be applied, then the
entrenchments were needless, and entail danger, for that method of defence =
is
not local, and entrenchments are only suited to a strictly local defence; b=
ut
if the entrenchments themselves are to be considered the chief impediments =
to
approach, then we may easily conceive that an <i>undefended</i> line will n=
ot
have much to say as an obstacle to approach. What is a twelve or fifteen fe=
et
ditch, and a rampart ten or twelve feet high, against the united efforts of
many thousands, if these efforts are not hindered by the fire of an enemy? =
The
consequence, therefore, is, that if such lines are short and tolerably well
defended by troops, they can be <i>turned;</i> but if they are extensive, a=
nd
not sufficiently occupied, they can be attacked in front, and taken without
much difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Now as lines of this description tie the troops down to a local defence, an=
d
take away from them all mobility, they are a bad and senseless means to use
against an enterprising enemy. If we find them long retained in modern wars=
 in
spite of these objections, the cause lies entirely in the low degree of ene=
rgy
impressed on the conduct of war, one consequence of which was, that seeming
difficulties often effected quite as much as real ones. Besides, in most
campaigns these lines were used merely for a secondary defence against
irregular incursions; if they have been found not wholly inefficacious for =
that
purpose, we must only keep in view, at the same time, how much more usefull=
y
the troops required for their defence might have been employed at other poi=
nts.
In the latest wars such lines have been out of the question, neither do we =
find
any trace of them; and it is doubtful if they will ever re-appear.
</p>

<p>
2. <i>Positions.</i>=E2=80=94The defence of a tract of country continues (a=
s we
shall show more plainly in the 27th chapter) as long as the force designate=
d
for it maintains itself there, and only ceases if that force removes and
abandons it.
</p>

<p>
If a force is to maintain itself in any district of country which is attack=
ed
by very superior forces, the means of protecting this force against the pow=
er
of the sword by a position which is unassailable is a first consideration.
</p>

<p>
Now such a position, as before said, must be able to show a front in all
directions; and in conformity with the <i>usual</i> extent of tactical
positions, if the force is not <i>very large</i> (and a large force would b=
e
contrary to the nature of the supposed case) it would take up a very small
space, which, in the course of the combat, would be exposed to so many
disadvantages that, even if strengthened in every possible way by
entrenchments, we could hardly expect to make a successful defence. Such a
camp, showing front in every direction, must therefore necessarily have an
extent of sides proportionably great; but these sides must likewise be as g=
ood
as unassailable; to give this requisite strength, notwithstanding the requi=
red
extension, is not within the compass of the art of field fortification; it =
is
therefore a fundamental condition that such a camp must derive part of its
strength from natural impediments of ground which render many places impass=
able
and others difficult to pass. In order, therefore, to be able to apply this
defensive means, it is necessary to find such a spot, and when that is want=
ing,
the object cannot be attained merely by field works. These considerations
relate more immediately to tactical results in order that we may first
establish the existence of this strategic means; we mention as examples for
illustration, Pirna, Bunzelwitz, Colberg, Torres Vedras, and Drissa. Now, a=
s
respects the strategic properties and effects. The first condition is natur=
ally
that the force which occupies this camp shall have its subsistence secured =
for
some time, that is, for as long as we think the camp will be required, and =
this
is only possible when the position has behind it a port, like Colberg and
Torres Vedras, or stands in connection with a fortress like Bunzelwitz and
Pirna, or has large dep=C3=B4ts within itself or in the immediate vicinity,=
 like
Drissa.
</p>

<p>
It is only in the first case that the provisioning can be ensured for any t=
ime
we please; in the second and third cases, it can only be so for a more or l=
ess
limited time, so that in this point there is always danger. From this appea=
rs
how the difficulty of subsistence debars the use of many strong points whic=
h
otherwise would be suitable for entrenched positions, and, therefore, makes
those that are eligible <i>scarce</i>.
</p>

<p>
In order to ascertain the eligibility of a position of this description, it=
s
advantages and defects, we must ask ourselves what the aggressor can do aga=
inst
it.
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> The assailant can pass by this strong position, pursue his
enterprise, and watch the position with a greater or less force.
</p>

<p>
We must here make a distinction between the cases of a position which is
occupied by the main body, and one only occupied by an inferior force.
</p>

<p>
In the first case the passing by the position can only benefit the assailan=
t,
if, besides the principal force of the defendant, there is also some other
attainable and <i>decisive object of attack</i>, as, for instance, the capt=
ure
of a fortress or a capital city, etc. But even if there is such an object, =
he
can only follow it if the strength of his base and the direction of his lin=
es
of communication are such that he has no cause to fear operations against h=
is
strategic flanks.
</p>

<p>
The conclusions to be drawn from this with respect to the admissibility and
eligibility of a strong position for the main body of the defender=E2=80=99=
s army
are, that it is only an advisable position when either the possibility of
operating against the strategic flank of the aggressor is so decisive that =
we
may be sure beforehand of being able in that way to keep him at a point whe=
re
his army can effect nothing, or in a case where there is no object attainab=
le
by the aggressor for which the defence need be uneasy. If there is such an
object, and the strategic flank of the assailant cannot be seriously menace=
d,
then such position should not be taken up, or if it is it should only be as=
 a
feint to see whether the assailant can be imposed upon respecting its value=
;
this is always attended with the danger, in case of failure, of being too l=
ate
to reach the point which is threatened.
</p>

<p>
If the strong position is only held by an inferior force, then the aggresso=
r
can never be at a loss for a further object of attack, because he has it in=
 the
main body itself of the enemy=E2=80=99s army; in this case, therefore, the =
value
of the position is entirely limited to the means which it affords of operat=
ing
against the enemy=E2=80=99s strategic flank, and depends upon that conditio=
n.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> If the assailant does not venture to pass by a position, he can
invest it and reduce it by famine. But this supposes two conditions beforeh=
and:
first, that the position is not open in rear, and secondly, that the assail=
ant
is sufficiently strong to be able to make such an investment. If these two
conditions are united then the assailant=E2=80=99s army certainly would be
neutralised for a time by this strong position, but at the same time, the
defensive pays the price of this advantage by a loss of his defensive force=
.
</p>

<p>
From this, therefore, we deduce that the occupation of such a strong positi=
on
with the main body is a measure only to be taken,=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>aa.</i> When the rear is perfectly safe (Torres Vedras).
</p>

<p>
<i>bb.</i> When we foresee that the enemy=E2=80=99s force is not strong eno=
ugh
formally to invest us in our camp. Should the enemy attempt the investment =
with
insufficient means, then we should be able to sally out of the camp and bea=
t
him in detail.
</p>

<p>
<i>cc.</i> When we can count upon relief like the Saxons at Pirna, 1756, an=
d as
took place in the main at Prague, because Prague could only be regarded as =
an
entrenched camp in which Prince Charles would not have allowed himself to b=
e
shut up if he had not known that the Moravian army could liberate him.
</p>

<p>
One of these three conditions is therefore absolutely necessary to justify =
the
choice of a strong position for the main body of an army; at the same time =
we
must add that the two last are bordering on a great danger for the defensiv=
e.
</p>

<p>
But if it is a question of exposing an inferior corps to the risk of being
sacrificed for the benefit of the whole, then these conditions disappear, a=
nd
the only point to decide is whether by such a sacrifice a greater evil may =
be
avoided. This will seldom happen; at the same time it is certainly not
inconceivable. The entrenched camp at Pirna prevented Frederick the Great f=
rom
attacking Bohemia, as he would have done, in the year 1756. The Austrians w=
ere
at that time so little prepared, that the loss of that kingdom appears beyo=
nd
doubt; and perhaps, a greater loss of men would have been connected with it
than the 17,000 allied troops who capitulated in the Pirna camp.
</p>

<p>
<i>c.</i> If none of those possibilities specified under <i>a</i> and <i>b<=
/i>
are in favour of the aggressor; if, therefore, the conditions which we have
there laid down for the defensive are fulfilled, then there remains certain=
ly
nothing to be done by the assailant but to fix himself before the position,
like a setter before a covey of birds, to spread himself, perhaps, as much =
as
possible by detachments over the country, and contenting himself with these
small and indecisive advantages to leave the real decision as to the posses=
sion
of territory to the future. In this case the position has fulfilled its obj=
ect.
</p>

<p>
3. <i>Entrenched camps near fortresses.</i>=E2=80=94They belong, as already=
 said,
to the class of entrenched positions generally, in so far, as they have for
their object to cover not a tract of territory, but an armed force against =
a
hostile attack, and only differ in reality from the other in this, that wit=
h
the fortress they make up an inseparable whole, by which they naturally acq=
uire
much greater strength.
</p>

<p>
But there follows further from the above the undermentioned special points.
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> That they may also have the particular object of rendering the si=
ege
of the fortress either impossible or extremely difficult. This object may b=
e
worth a great sacrifice of troops if the place is a port which cannot be
blockaded, but in any other case we have to take care lest the place is one
which may be reduced by hunger so soon that the sacrifice of any considerab=
le
number of troops is not justifiable.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> Entrenched camps can be formed near fortresses for smaller bodies=
 of
troops than those in the open field. Four or five thousand men may be
invincible under the walls of a fortress, when, on the contrary, in the
strongest camp in the world, formed in the open field, they would be lost.
</p>

<p>
<i>c.</i> They may be used for the assembly and organisation of forces whic=
h
have still too little solidity to be trusted in contact with the enemy, wit=
hout
the support afforded by the works of the place, as for example, recruits,
militia, national levies, etc.
</p>

<p>
They might, therefore, be recommended as a very useful measure, in many way=
s,
if they had not the immense disadvantage of injuring the fortress, more or
less, when they cannot be occupied; and to provide the fortress always with=
 a
garrison, in some measure sufficient to occupy the camp also, would be much=
 too
onerous a condition.
</p>

<p>
We are, therefore, very much inclined to consider them only advisable for
places on a sea coast, and as more injurious than useful in all other cases=
.
</p>

<p>
If, in conclusion, we should summarise our opinion in a general view, then
strong and entrenched positions are=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. The more requisite the smaller the country, the less the space afforded =
for
a retreat.
</p>

<p>
2. The less dangerous the more surely we can reckon on succouring or reliev=
ing
them by other forces, or by the inclemency of season, or by a rising of the
nation, or by want, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
3. The more efficacious, the weaker the elementary force of the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
attack.

<h3><a name=3D"chap78"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>Flank Positions</h3>

<p>
We have only allotted to this prominent conception, in the world of ordinar=
y
military theory, a special chapter in dictionary fashion, that it may the m=
ore
easily be found; for we do not believe that anything independent in itself =
is
denoted by the term.
</p>

<p>
Every position which is to be held, even if the enemy passes by it, is a fl=
ank
position; for from the moment that he does so it can have no other efficacy=
 but
that which it exercises on the enemy=E2=80=99s strategic flank. Therefore,
necessarily, all <i>strong positions</i> are flank positions as well; for a=
s
they cannot be attacked, the enemy accordingly is driven to pass them by,
therefore they can only have a value by their influence on his strategic fl=
ank.
The direction of the proper front of a strong position is quite immaterial,
whether it runs parallel with the enemy=E2=80=99s strategic flank, as Colbe=
rg, or
at right angles as Bunzelwitz and Drissa, for a strong position must front
every way.
</p>

<p>
But it may also be desirable still to maintain a position which is <i>not</=
i>
unassailable, even if the enemy passes by it, should its situation, for
instance, give us such a preponderating advantage in the comparative relati=
ons
of the lines of retreat and communication, that we can not only make an
efficacious attack on the strategic flank of the advancing enemy, but also =
that
the enemy alarmed for his own retreat is unable to seize ours entirely; for=
 if
that last is not the case, then because our position is not a strong, that =
is
not an <i>unassailable one</i>, we should run the risk of being obliged to
fight without having the command of any retreat.
</p>

<p>
The year 1806 affords an example which throws a light on this. The disposit=
ion
of the Prussian army, on the right bank of the Saal, might in respect to
Buonaparte=E2=80=99s advance by Hof, have become in every sense a flank pos=
ition,
if the army had been drawn up with its front parallel to the Saal, and ther=
e,
in that position, waited the progress of events.
</p>

<p>
If there had not been here such a disproportion of moral and physical power=
s,
if there had only been a Daun at the head of the French army, then the Prus=
sian
position might have shown its efficacy by a most brilliant result. To pass =
it
by was quite impossible; that was acknowledged by Buonaparte, by his resolu=
tion
to attack it; in severing from it the line of retreat even Buonaparte himse=
lf
did not <i>completely</i> succeed, and if the disproportion in physical and
moral relations had not been quite so great, that would have been just as
little practicable as the passing it by, for the Prussian army was in much =
less
danger from its left wing being overpowered than the French army would have
been by the defeat of their left wing. Even with the disproportion of physi=
cal
and moral power as it existed, a resolute and sagacious exercise of the com=
mand
would still have given great hopes of a victory. There was nothing to preve=
nt
the Duke of Brunswick from making arrangements on the 13th, so that on the
morning of the 14th, at day-break, he might have opposed 80,000 men to the
60,000 with which Buonaparte passed the Saal, near Jena and Dornburg. Had e=
ven
this superiority in numbers, and the steep valley of the Saal behind the Fr=
ench
not been sufficient to procure a decisive victory, still it was a fortunate
concurrence of circumstances, and if with such advantages no successful
decision could be gained, no decision was to be expected in that district o=
f
country; and we should, therefore, have retreated further, in order to gain
reinforcements and weaken the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The Prussian position on the Saal, therefore, although assailable, might ha=
ve
been regarded as a flank position in respect to the great road through Hof;=
 but
like every position which can be attacked, that property is not to be
attributed to it absolutely, because it would only have become so if the en=
emy
had not attempted to attack it.
</p>

<p>
Still less would it bespeak a clear idea if those positions which <i>cannot=
</i>
be maintained after the enemy has passed by them, and from which, in
consequence of that, the defensive seeks to attack the assailant=E2=80=99s =
flank,
were called <i>flank positions</i> merely because his attack is directed
against a flank; for this flank attack has hardly anything to do with the
position itself, or, at least, is not mainly produced by its properties, as=
 is
the case in the action against a strategic flank.
</p>

<p>
It appears from this that there is nothing new to establish with regard to =
the
properties of a flank position. A few words only on the character of the
measure may properly be introduced here; we set aside, however, completely
strong positions in the true sense, as we have said enough about them alrea=
dy.
</p>

<p>
A flank position which is not assailable is an extremely efficacious
instrument, but certainly just on that account a dangerous one. If the
assailant is checked by it, then we have obtained a great effect by a small
expenditure of force; it is the pressure of the finger on the long lever of=
 a
sharp bit. But if the effect is too insignificant, if the assailant is not
stopped, then the defensive has more or less imperilled his retreat, and mu=
st
seek to escape either in haste and by a detour=E2=80=94consequently under v=
ery
unfavourable circumstances, or he is in danger of being compelled to fight
without any line of retreat being open to him. Against a bold adversary, ha=
ving
the moral superiority, and seeking a decisive solution, this means is there=
fore
extremely hazardous and entirely out of place, as shown by the example of 1=
806
above quoted. On the other hand, when used against a cautious opponent in a=
 war
of mere observation, it may be reckoned one of the best means which the
defensive can adopt. The Duke Ferdinand=E2=80=99s defence of the Weser by h=
is
position on the left bank, and the well-known positions of Schmotseifen and
Landshut are examples of this; only the latter, it is true, by the catastro=
phe
which befell Fouqu=C3=A9=E2=80=99s corps in 1760, also shows the danger of =
a false
application.

<h3><a name=3D"chap79"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>Defence of Mountains</h3>

<p>
The influence of mountains on the conduct of war is very great; the subject=
,
therefore, is very important for theory. As this influence introduces into
action a retarding principle, it belongs chiefly to the defensive. We shall
therefore discuss it here in a wider sense than that conveyed by the simple
conception, defence of mountains. As we have discovered in our consideratio=
n of
the subject results which run counter to general opinion in many points, we
shall therefore be obliged to enter into rather an elaborate analysis of it=
.
</p>

<p>
We shall first examine the tactical nature of the subject, in order to gain=
 the
point where it connects itself with strategy.
</p>

<p>
The endless difficulty attending the march of large columns on mountain roa=
ds,
the extraordinary strength which a small post obtains by a steep scarp cove=
ring
its front, and by ravines right and left supporting its flanks, are
unquestionably the principal causes why such efficacy and strength are
universally attributed to the defence of mountains, so that nothing but the
peculiarities in armament and tactics at certain periods has prevented larg=
e
masses of combatants from engaging in it.
</p>

<p>
When a column, winding like a serpent, toils its way through narrow ravines=
 up
to the top of a mountain, and passes over it at a snail=E2=80=99s pace, art=
illery
and train-drivers, with oaths and shouts, flogging their over-driven cattle
through the narrow rugged roads, each broken waggon has to be got out of th=
e
way with indescribable trouble, whilst all behind are detained, cursing and
blaspheming, every one then thinks to himself, Now if the enemy should appe=
ar
with only a few hundred men, he might disperse the whole. From this has
originated the expression used by historical writers, when they describe a
narrow pass as a place where =E2=80=9Ca handful of men might keep an army i=
n
check.=E2=80=9D At the same time, every one who has had any experience in w=
ar
knows, or ought to know, that such a march through mountains has little or
nothing in common with <i>the attack</i> of these same mountains, and that
therefore to infer from the <i>difficulty</i> of marching through mountains
that the difficulty of attacking them must be much greater is a false
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
It is natural enough that an inexperienced person should thus argue, and it=
 is
almost as natural that the art of war itself for a certain time should have
been entangled in the same error, for the fact which it related to was almo=
st
as new at that time to those accustomed to war as to the uninitiated. Befor=
e
the Thirty Years=E2=80=99 War, owing to the deep order of battle, the numer=
ous
cavalry, the rude fire-arms, and other peculiarities, it was quite unusual =
to
make use of formidable obstacles of ground in war, and a formal defence of
mountains, at least by regular troops, was almost impossible. It was not un=
til
a more extended order of battle was introduced, and that infantry and their
arms became the chief part of an army, that the use which might be made of
hills and valleys occurred to men=E2=80=99s minds. But it was not until a h=
undred
years afterwards, or about the middle of the eighteenth century, that the i=
dea
became fully developed.
</p>

<p>
The second circumstance, namely, the great defensive capability which might=
 be
given to a small post planted on a point difficult of access, was still mor=
e
suited to lead to an exaggerated idea of the strength of mountain defences.=
 The
opinion arose that it was only necessary to multiply such a post by a certa=
in
number to make an army out of a battalion, a chain of mountains out of a
mountain.
</p>

<p>
It is undeniable that a small post acquires an extraordinary strength by
selecting a good position in a mountainous country. A small detatchment, wh=
ich
would be driven off in the level country by a couple of squadrons, and thin=
k
itself lucky to save itself from rout or capture by a hasty retreat, can in=
 the
mountains stand up before a whole army, and, as one might say, with a kind =
of
tactical effrontery exact the military honour of a regular attack, of havin=
g
its flank turned, etc., etc. How it obtains this defensive power, by obstac=
les
to approach, <i>points d=E2=80=99appui</i> for its flanks, and new position=
s
which it finds on its retreat, is a subject for tactics to explain; we acce=
pt
it as an established fact.
</p>

<p>
It was very natural to believe that a number of such posts placed in a line
would give a very strong, almost unassailable front, and all that remained =
to
be done was to prevent the position from being turned by extending it right=
 and
left until either flank-supports were met with commensurate with the import=
ance
of the whole, or until the extent of the position itself gave security agai=
nst
turning movements. A mountainous country specially invites such a course by
presenting such a succession of defensive positions, each one apparently be=
tter
than another, that one does not know where to stop; and therefore it ended =
in
all and every approach to the mountains within a certain distance being
guarded, with a view to defence, and ten or fifteen single posts, thus spre=
ad
over a space of about ten miles or more, were supposed to bid defiance to t=
hat
odious turning movement. Now as the connection between these posts was
considered sufficiently secure by the intervening spaces, being ground of a=
n
impassable nature (columns at that time not being able to quit the regular
roads), it was thought a wall of brass was thus presented to the enemy. As =
an
extra precaution, a few battalions, some horse artillery, and a dozen squad=
rons
of cavalry, formed a reserve to provide against the event of the line being
unexpectedly burst through at any point.
</p>

<p>
No one will deny that the prevalence of this idea is shown by history, and =
it
is not certain that at this day we are completely emancipated from these
errors.
</p>

<p>
The course of improvement in tactics since the Middle Ages, with the ever
increasing strength of armies, likewise contributed to bring mountainous
districts in this sense more within the scope of military action.
</p>

<p>
The chief characteristic of mountain defence is its complete passivity; in =
this
light the tendency towards the defence of mountains was very natural before
armies attained to their present capability of movement. But armies were
constantly becoming greater, and on account of the effect of fire-arms bega=
n to
extend more and more into long thin lines connected with a great deal of ar=
t,
and on that account very difficult, often almost impossible, to move. To
dispose, in order of battle, such an artistic machine, was often half a
day=E2=80=99s work, and half the battle; and almost all which is now attend=
ed to
in the preliminary plan of the battle was included in this first dispositio=
n or
drawing up. After this work was done it was therefore difficult to make any
modifications to suit new circumstances which might spring up; from this it
followed that the assailant, being the last to form his line of battle,
naturally adapted it to the order of battle adopted by the enemy, without t=
he
latter being able in turn to modify his in accordance. The attack thus acqu=
ired
a general superiority, and the defensive had no other means of reinstating =
the
balance than that of seeking protection from the impediments of ground, and=
 for
this nothing was so favourable in general as mountainous ground. Thus it be=
came
an object to couple, as it were, the army with a formidable obstacle of gro=
und,
and the two united then made common cause. The battalion defended the mount=
ain,
and the mountain the battalion; so the passive defence through the aid of
mountainous ground became highly efficacious, and there was no other evil i=
n
the thing itself except that it entailed a greater loss of freedom of movem=
ent,
but of that quality they did not understand the particular use at that time=
.
</p>

<p>
When two antagonistic systems act upon each other, the exposed, that is, th=
e
weak point on the one side always draws upon itself the blows from the othe=
r
side. If the defensive becomes fixed, and as it were, spell-bound in posts,
which are in themselves strong, and can not be taken, the aggressor then
becomes bold in turning movements, because he has no apprehension about his=
 own
flanks. This is what took place=E2=80=94The <i>turning</i>, as it was calle=
d,
soon became the order of the day: to counteract this, positions were extend=
ed
more and more; they were thus weakened in front, and the offensive suddenly
turned upon that part: instead of trying to outflank by extending, the
assailant now concentrated his masses for attack at some one point, and the
line was broken. This is nearly what took place in regard to mountain defen=
ces
according to the latest modern history.
</p>

<p>
The offensive had thus again gained a preponderance through the greater
mobility of troops; and it was only through the same means that the defence
could seek for help. But mountainous ground by its nature is opposed to
mobility, and thus the whole theory of mountain defence experienced, if we =
may
use the expression, a defeat like that which the armies engaged in it in th=
e
Revolutionary war so often suffered.
</p>

<p>
But that we may not reject the good with the bad, and allow ourselves to be
carried along by the stream of commonplace to assertions which, in actual
experience, would be refuted a thousand times by the force of circumstances=
, we
must distinguish the effects of mountain defence according to the nature of=
 the
cases.
</p>

<p>
The principal question to be decided here, and that which throws the greate=
st
light over the whole subject is, whether the resistance which is intended b=
y
the defence of mountains is to be <i>relative</i> or
<i>absolute</i>=E2=80=94whether it is only intended to last for a time, or =
is
meant to end in a decisive victory. For a resistance of the first kind
mountainous ground is in a high degree suitable, and introduces into it a v=
ery
powerful element of strength; for one of the latter kind, on the contrary, =
it
is in general not at all suitable, or only so in some special cases.
</p>

<p>
In mountains every movement is slower and more difficult, costs also more t=
ime,
and more men as well, if within the sphere of danger. But the loss of the
assailant in time and men is the standard by which the defensive resistance=
 is
measured. As long as the movement is all on the side of the offensive so lo=
ng
the defensive has a marked advantage; but as soon as the defensive resorts =
to
this principle of movement also, that advantage ceases. Now from the nature=
 of
the thing, that is to say, on tactical grounds, a relative resistance allow=
s of
a much greater degree of passivity than one which is intended to lead to a
decisive result, and it allows this passivity to be carried to an extreme, =
that
is, to the end of the combat, which in the other case can never happen. The
impeding element of mountain ground, which as a medium of greater density
weakens all positive activity, is, therefore, completely suited to the pass=
ive
defence.
</p>

<p>
We have already said that a small post acquires an extraordinary strength b=
y
the nature of the ground; but although this tactical result in general requ=
ires
no further proof, we must add to what we have said some explanation. We mus=
t be
careful here to draw a distinction between what is relatively and what is
absolutely small. If a body of troops, let its size be what it may, isolate=
s a
portion of itself in a position, this portion may possibly be exposed to th=
e
attack of the whole body of the enemy=E2=80=99s troops, therefore of a supe=
rior
force, in opposition to which it is itself small. There, as a rule, no abso=
lute
but only a relative defence can be the object. The smaller the post in rela=
tion
to the whole body from which it is detached and in relation to the whole bo=
dy
of the enemy, the more this applies.
</p>

<p>
But a post also which is small in an absolute sense, that is, one which is =
not
opposed by an enemy superior to itself, and which, therefore, may aspire to=
 an
absolute defence, a real victory, will be infinitely better off in mountain=
s
than a large army, and can derive more advantage from the ground as we shal=
l
show further on.
</p>

<p>
Our conclusion, therefore, is, that a small post in mountains possesses gre=
at
strength. How this may be of decisive utility in all cases which depend
entirely on a <i>relative</i> defence is plain of itself; but will it be of=
 the
same decisive utility for the <i>absolute</i> defence by a whole army? This=
 is
the question which we now propose to examine.
</p>

<p>
First of all we ask whether a front line composed of several posts has, as =
has
hitherto been assumed, the same strength proportionally as each post singly=
.
This is certainly not the case, and to suppose so would involve one of two
errors.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, a country <i>without roads</i> is often confounded with=
 one
which is <i>quite impassable</i>. Where a column, or where artillery and
cavalry cannot <i>march</i>, infantry may still, in general, be able to pas=
s,
and even artillery may often be brought there as well, for the movements ma=
de
in a battle by excessive efforts of short duration are not to be judged of =
by
the same scale as marches. The secure connection of the single posts with o=
ne
another rests therefore on an illusion, and the flanks are in reality in
danger.
</p>

<p>
Or next it is supposed, a line of small posts, which are very strong in fro=
nt,
are also equally strong on their flanks, because a ravine, a precipice, etc=
.,
etc., form excellent supports for a small post. But why are they so?=E2=80=
=94not
because they make it impossible to turn the post, but because they cause th=
e
enemy an expenditure of time and of force, which gives scope for the effect=
ual
action of the post. The enemy who, in spite of the difficulty of the ground=
,
wishes, and in fact is obliged, to turn such a post, because the front is
unassailable requires, perhaps, half-a-day to execute his purpose, and cann=
ot
after all accomplish it without some loss of men. Now if such a post can be
succoured, or if it is only designed to resist for a certain space of time,=
 or
lastly, if it is able to cope with the enemy, then the flank supports have =
done
their part, and we may say the position had not only a strong front, but st=
rong
flanks as well. But it is not the same if it is a question of a line of pos=
ts,
forming part of an extended mountain position. None of these three conditio=
ns
are realised in that case. The enemy attacks one point with an overwhelming
force, the support in rear is perhaps slight, and yet it is a question of
absolute resistance. Under such circumstances the flank supports of such po=
sts
are worth nothing.
</p>

<p>
Upon a weak point like this the attack usually directs its blows. The assau=
lt
with concentrated, and therefore very superior forces, upon a point in fron=
t,
may certainly <i>be met by a resistance, which is very violent as regards t=
hat
point, but which is unimportant as regards the whole.</i> After it is overc=
ome,
the line is pierced, and the object of the attack attained.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows that the relative resistance in mountain warfare is, i=
n
general, greater than in a level country, that it is comparatively greatest=
 in
small posts, and does not increase in the same measure as the masses increa=
se.
</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to the real object of great battles generally=E2=80=94to th=
e
<i>positive victory</i> which may also be the object in the defence of
mountains. If the whole mass, or the principal part of the force, is employ=
ed
for that purpose, then <i>the defence of mountains</i> changes itself <i>eo
ipso</i> into a <i>defensive battle in the mountains</i>. A battle, that is=
 the
application of all our powers to the destruction of the enemy is now the fo=
rm,
a victory the object of the combat. The defence of mountains which takes pl=
ace
in this combat, appears now a subordinate consideration, for it is no longe=
r
the object, it is only the means. Now in this view, how does the ground in
mountains answer to the object?
</p>

<p>
The character of a defensive battle is a passive reaction in front, and an
increased active reaction in rear; but for this the ground in mountains is =
a
paralysing principle. There are two reasons for this: first, want of roads
affording means of rapidly moving in all directions, from the rear towards =
the
front, and even the sudden tactical attack is hampered by the unevenness of
ground; secondly, a free view over the country, and the enemy=E2=80=99s mov=
ements
is not to be had. The ground in mountains, therefore, ensures in this case =
to
the enemy the same advantages which it gave to us in the front, and deadens=
 all
the better half of the resistance. To this is to be added a third objection=
,
namely the danger of being cut off. Much as a mountainous country is favour=
able
to a retreat, made under a pressure exerted along the whole front, and grea=
t as
may be the loss of time to an enemy who makes a turning movement in such a
country, still these again are only advantages in the case of a <i>relative
defence</i>, advantages which have no connection with the decisive battle, =
the
resistance to the last extremity. The resistance will last certainly somewh=
at
longer, that is until the enemy has reached a point with his flank-columns
which menaces or completely bars our retreat. Once he has gained such a poi=
nt
then relief is a thing hardly possible. No act of the offensive which we ca=
n
make from the rear can drive him out again from the <i>points which threate=
n
us;</i> no desperate assault with our whole mass can clear the passage <i>w=
hich
he blocks</i>. Whoever thinks he discovers in this a contradiction, and
believes that the advantages which the assailant has in mountain warfare, m=
ust
also accrue to the defensive in an attempt to cut his way through, forgets =
the
difference of circumstances. The corps which opposes the passage is not eng=
aged
in an <i>absolute</i> defence, a few hours=E2=80=99 resistance will probabl=
y be
sufficient; it is, therefore, in the situation of a small post. Besides thi=
s,
its opponent is no longer in full possession of all his fighting powers; he=
 is
thrown into disorder, wants ammunition, etc. Therefore, in any view, the ch=
ance
of cutting through is small, and this is the danger that the defensive fear=
s
above all; this fear is at work even during the battle, and enervates every
fibre of the struggling athlete. A nervous sensibility springs up on the
flanks, and every small detachment which the aggressor makes a display of o=
n
any wooded eminence in our rear, is for him a new lever, helping on the
victory.
</p>

<p>
These disadvantages will, for the most part, disappear, leaving all the
advantages, if the defence of a mountain district consists in the concentra=
ted
disposition of the army on an extensive mountain plateau. There we may imag=
ine
a very strong front; flanks very difficult of approach, and yet the most
perfect freedom of movement, both within and in rear of the position. Such =
a
position would be one of the strongest that there can be, but it is little =
more
than an illusion, for although most mountains are more easily traversed alo=
ng
their crests than on their declivities, yet most plateaux of mountains are
either too small for such a purpose, or they have no proper right to be cal=
led
plateaux, and are so termed more in a geological, than in a geometrical sen=
se.
</p>

<p>
For smaller bodies of troops, the disadvantages of a defensive position in
mountains diminish as we have already remarked. The cause of this is, that =
such
bodies take up less space, and require fewer roads for retreat, etc., etc. =
A
single hill is not a mountain system, and has not the same disadvantages. T=
he
smaller the force, the more easily it can establish itself on a single ridg=
e or
hill, and the less will be the necessity for it to get entangled in the
intricacies of countless steep mountain gorges.

<p>
We now proceed to the strategic use of the tactical results developed in th=
e
preceding chapter. We make a distinction between the following points:
</p>

<p>
1. A mountainous district as a battle-field.
</p>

<p>
2. The influence which the possession of it exercises on other parts of the
country.
</p>

<p>
3. Its effect as a strategic barrier.
</p>

<p>
4. The attention which it demands in respect to the supply of the troops.
</p>

<p>
The first and most important of these heads, we must again subdivide as
follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> A general action.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> Inferior combats.
</p>

<h4>
1. A mountain system as a battle-field.
</h4>

<p>
We have shown in the preceding chapter how unfavourable <i>mountain ground<=
/i>
is to the defensive in a <i>decisive battle</i>, and, on the other hand, ho=
w
much it favours the assailant. This runs exactly counter to the generally
received opinion; but then how many other things there are which general
opinion confuses; how little does it draw distinctions between things which=
 are
of the most opposite nature! From the powerful resistance which small bodie=
s of
troops may offer in a mountainous country, common opinion becomes impressed
with an idea that all mountain defence is extremely strong, and is astonish=
ed
when any one denies that this great strength is communicated to the greates=
t
act of all defence, the defensive battle. On the other hand, it is instantl=
y
ready, whenever a battle is lost by the defensive in mountain warfare, to p=
oint
out the inconceivable error of a system of cordon war, without any regard t=
o
the fact that in the nature of things such a system is unavoidable in mount=
ain
warfare. We do not hesitate to put ourselves in direct opposition to such a=
n
opinion, and at the same time we must mention, that to our great satisfacti=
on,
we have found our views supported in the works of an author whose opinion o=
ught
to have great weight in this matter; we allude to the history of the campai=
gns
of 1796 and 1797, by the Archduke Charles, himself a good historical writer=
, a
good critic, and above all, a good general.
</p>

<p>
We can only characterise it as a lamentable position when the weaker defend=
er,
who has laboriously, by the greatest effort, assembled all his forces, in o=
rder
to make the assailant feel the effect of his love of Fatherland, of his
enthusiasm and his ability, in a decisive battle when he on whom every eye =
is
fixed in anxious expectation, having betaken himself to the obscurity of
thickly veiled mountains, and hampered in every movement by the obstinate
ground, stands exposed to the thousand possible forms of attack which his
powerful adversary can use against him. Only towards one single side is the=
re
still left an open field for his intelligence, and that is in making all
possible use of every obstacle of ground; but this leads close to the borde=
rs
of the disastrous war of cordons, which, under all circumstances, is to be
avoided. Very far therefore from seeing a refuge for the defensive, in a
mountainous country, when a decisive battle is sought, we should rather adv=
ise
a general in such a case to avoid such a field by every possible means.
</p>

<p>
It is true, however, that this is sometimes impossible; but the battle will
then necessarily have a very different character from one in a level countr=
y:
the disposition of the troops will be much more extended in most cases twic=
e or
three times the length; the resistance more passive, the counter blow much =
less
effective. These are influences of mountain ground which are inevitable; st=
ill,
in such a battle the defensive is not to be converted into a mere defence o=
f
mountains; the predominating character must be a concentrated order of batt=
le
in the mountains, in which everything unites into <i>one</i> battle, and pa=
sses
as much as possible under the eye of <i>one</i> commander, and in which the=
re
are sufficient reserves to make the decision something more than a mere war=
ding
off, a mere holding up of the shield. This condition is indispensable, but
difficult to realise; and the drifting into the pure defence of mountains c=
omes
so naturally, that we cannot be surprised at its often happening; the dange=
r in
this is so great that theory cannot too urgently raise a warning voice.
</p>

<p>
Thus much as to a decisive battle with the main body of the army.
</p>

<p>
For combats of minor significance and importance, a mountainous country, on=
 the
other hand, may be very favourable, because the main point in them is not
absolute defence, and because no decisive results are coupled with them. We=
 may
make this plainer by enumerating the objects of this reaction.
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> Merely to gain time. This motive occurs a hundred times: always i=
n
the case of a defensive line formed with the view of observation; besides t=
hat,
in all cases in which a reinforcement is expected.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> The repulse of a mere demonstration or minor enterprise of the en=
emy.
If a province is guarded by mountains which are defended by troops, then th=
is
defence, however weak, will always suffice to prevent partisan attacks and
expeditions intended to plunder the country. Without the mountains, such a =
weak
chain of posts would be useless.
</p>

<p>
<i>c.</i> To make demonstrations on our own part. It will be some time yet
before general opinion with respect to mountains will be brought to the rig=
ht
point; until then an enemy may at any time be met with who is afraid of the=
m,
and shrinks back from them in his undertakings. In such a case, therefore, =
the
principal body may also be used for the defence of a mountain system. In wa=
rs
carried on with little energy or movement, this state of things will often
happen; but it must always be a condition then that we neither design to ac=
cept
a general action in this mountain position, nor can be compelled to do so.
</p>

<p>
<i>d.</i> In general, a mountainous country is suited for all positions in
which we do not intend to accept any great battle, for each of the separate
parts of the army is stronger there, and it is only the whole that is weake=
r;
besides, in such a position, it is not so easy to be suddenly attacked and
forced into a decisive battle.
</p>

<p>
<i>e.</i> Lastly, a mountainous country is the true region for the efforts =
of a
people in arms. But while national risings should always be supported by sm=
all
bodies of regular troops, on the other hand, the proximity of a great army
seems to have an unfavourable effect upon movements of this kind; this moti=
ve,
therefore, as a rule, will never give occasion for transferring the whole a=
rmy
to the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Thus much for mountains in connection with the positions which may be taken=
 up
there for battle.
</p>

<h4>
2. The influence of mountains on other parts of the country.
</h4>

<p>
Because, as we have seen, it is so easy in mountainous ground to secure a
considerable tract of territory by small posts, so weak in numbers that in =
a
district easily traversed they could not maintain themselves, and would be
continually exposed to danger; because every step forward in mountains whic=
h
have been occupied by the enemy must be made much more slowly than in a lev=
el
country, and therefore cannot be made at the same rate with him therefore t=
he
question, Who is in possession? is also much more important in reference to
mountains than to any other tract of country of equal extent. In an open
country, the possession may change from day to day. The mere advance of str=
ong
detachments compels the enemy to give up the country we want to occupy. But=
 it
is not so in mountains; there a very stout resistance is possible by much
inferior forces, and for that reason, if we require a portion of country wh=
ich
includes mountains, enterprises of a special nature, formed for the purpose=
,
and often necessitating a considerable expenditure of time as well as of me=
n,
are always required in order to obtain possession. If, therefore, the mount=
ains
of a country are not the theatre of the principal operations of a war, we
cannot, as we should were it the case of a district of level country, look =
upon
the possession of the mountains as dependent on and a necessary consequence=
 of
our success at other parts.
</p>

<p>
A mountainous district has therefore much more independence, and the posses=
sion
of it is much firmer and less liable to change. If we add to this that a ri=
dge
of mountains from its crests affords a good view over the adjacent open
country, whilst it remains itself veiled in obscurity, we may therefore
conceive that when we are close to mountains, without being in actual
possession of them, they are to be regarded as a constant source of
disadvantage a sort of laboratory of hostile forces; and this will be the c=
ase
in a still greater degree if the mountains are not only occupied by the ene=
my,
but also form part of his territory. The smallest bodies of adventurous
partisans always find shelter there if pursued, and can then sally forth ag=
ain
with impunity at other points; the largest bodies, under their cover, can
approach unperceived, and our forces must, therefore, always keep at a
sufficient distance if they would avoid getting within reach of their
dominating influence if they would not be exposed to disadvantageous combat=
s
and sudden attacks which they cannot return.
</p>

<p>
In this manner every mountain system, as far as a certain distance, exercis=
es a
very great influence over the lower and more level country adjacent to it.
Whether this influence shall take effect momentarily, for instance in a bat=
tle
(as at Maltsch on the Rhine, 1796) or only after some time upon the lines o=
f
communication, depends on the local relations; whether or not it shall be
overcome through some decisive event happening in the valley or level count=
ry,
depends on the relations of the armed forces to each other respectively.
</p>

<p>
Buonaparte, in 1805 and 1809, advanced upon Vienna without troubling himsel=
f
much about the Tyrol; but Moreau had to leave Swabia in 1796, chiefly becau=
se
he was not master of the more elevated parts of the country, and too many
troops were required to watch them. In campaigns, in which there is an even=
ly
balanced series of alternate successes on each side, we shall not expose
ourselves to the constant disadvantage of the mountains remaining in posses=
sion
of the enemy: we need, therefore, only endeavour to seize and retain posses=
sion
of that portion of them which is required on account of the direction of th=
e
principal lines of our attack; this generally leads to the mountains being =
the
arena of the separate minor combats which take place between forces on each
side. But we must be careful of overrating the importance of this circumsta=
nce,
and being led to consider a mountain-chain as the key to the whole in all
cases, and its possession as the main point. When a victory is the object
sought; then it is the principal, object; and if the victory is gained, oth=
er
things can be regulated according to the paramount requirement of the
situation.
</p>

<h4>
3. Mountains considered in their aspect of a strategic barrier.
</h4>

<p>
We must divide this subject under two heads.
</p>

<p>
The first is again that of a decisive battle. We can, for instance, conside=
r
the mountain chain as a river, that is, as a barrier with certain points of
passage, which may afford us an opportunity of gaining a victory, because t=
he
enemy will be compelled by it to divide his forces in advancing, and is tie=
d
down to certain roads, which will enable us with our forces concentrated be=
hind
the mountains to fall upon fractions of his force. As the assailant on his
march through the mountains, irrespective of all other considerations, cann=
ot
march in a single column because he would thus expose himself to the danger=
 of
getting engaged in a decisive battle with only one line of retreat, therefo=
re,
the defensive method recommends itself certainly on substantial grounds. Bu=
t as
the conception of mountains and their outlets is very undefined, the questi=
on
of adopting this plan depends entirely on the nature of the country itself,=
 and
it can only be pointed out as possible whilst it must also be considered as
attended with two disadvantages, the first is, that if the enemy receives a
severe blow, he soon finds shelter in the mountains; the second is, that he=
 is
in possession of the higher ground, which, although not decisive, must stil=
l
always be regarded as a disadvantage for the pursuer.
</p>

<p>
We know of no battle given under such circumstances unless the battle with
Alvinzi in 1796 can be so classed. But that the case <i>may</i> occur is pl=
ain
from Buonaparte=E2=80=99s passage of the Alps in the year 1800, when Melas =
might
and should have fallen on him with his whole force before he had united his
columns.
</p>

<p>
The second influence which mountains may have as a barrier is that which th=
ey
have upon the lines of communication if they cross those lines. Without tak=
ing
into account what may be done by erecting forts at the points of passage an=
d by
arming the people, the bad roads in mountains at certain seasons of the yea=
r
may of themselves alone prove at once destructive to an army; they have
frequently compelled a retreat after having first sucked all the marrow and
blood out of the army. If, in addition, troops of active partisans hover ro=
und,
or there is a national rising to add to the difficulties, then the
enemy=E2=80=99s army is obliged to make large detachments, and at last driv=
en to
form strong posts in the mountains and thus gets engaged in one of the most
disadvantageous situations that can be in an offensive war.
</p>

<h4>
4. Mountains in their relation to the provisioning of an army.
</h4>

<p>
This is a very simple subject, easy to understand. The opportunity to make =
the
best use of them in this respect is when the assailant is either obliged to
remain in the mountains, or at least to leave them close in his rear.
</p>

<p class=3D"p2">
These considerations on the defence of mountains, which, in the main, embra=
ce
all mountain warfare, and, by their reflection, throw also the necessary li=
ght
on offensive war, must not be deemed incorrect or impracticable because we =
can
neither make plains out of mountains, nor hills out of plains, and the choi=
ce
of a theatre of war is determined by so many other things that it appears a=
s if
there was little margin left for considerations of this kind. In affairs of
magnitude it will be found that this margin is not so small. If it is a
question of the disposition and effective employment of the principal force=
,
and that, even in the moment of a decisive battle, by a few marches more to=
 the
front or rear an army can be brought out of mountain ground into the level
country, then a resolute concentration of the chief masses in the plain wil=
l
neutralise the adjoining mountains.
</p>

<p>
We shall now once more collect the light which has been thrown on the subje=
ct,
and bring it to a focus in one distinct picture.
</p>

<p>
We maintain and believe we have shown, that mountains, both tactically and
strategically, are in general unfavourable to the defensive, meaning thereb=
y,
that kind of defensive which is <i>decisive</i>, on the result of which the
question of the possession or loss of the country depends. They limit the v=
iew
and prevent movements in every direction; they force a state of passivity, =
and
make it necessary to stop every avenue or passage, which always leads more =
or
less to a war of cordons. We should therefore, if possible, avoid mountains
with the principal mass of our force, and leave them on one side, or keep t=
hem
before or behind us.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, we think that, for minor operations and objects, there is=
 an
element of increased strength to be found in mountain ground; and after wha=
t
has been said, we shall not be accused of inconsistency in maintaining that
such a country is the real place of refuge for the weak, that is, for those=
 who
dare not any longer seek an absolute decision. On the other hand again, the
advantages derived from a mountainous country by troops acting an inferior =
r=C3=B4le
cannot be participated in by large masses of troops.
</p>

<p>
Still all these considerations will hardly counteract the impressions made =
on
the senses. The imagination not only of the inexperienced but also of all t=
hose
accustomed to bad methods of war will still feel in the concrete case such =
an
overpowering dread of the difficulties which the inflexible and retarding
nature of mountainous ground opposes to all the movements of an assailant, =
that
they will hardly be able to look upon our opinion as anything but a most
singular paradox. Then again, with those who take a general view, the histo=
ry
of the last century (with its peculiar form of war) will take the place of =
the
impressions of the senses, and therefore there will be but few who will not
still adhere to the belief that Austria, for example, should be better able=
 to
defend her states on the Italian side than on the side of the Rhine. On the
other hand, the French who carried on war for twenty years under a leader b=
oth
energetic and indifferent to minor considerations, and have constantly befo=
re
their eyes the successful results thus obtained, will, for some time to com=
e,
distinguish themselves in this as well as in other cases by the tact of a
practised judgment.
</p>

<p>
Does it follow from this that a state would be better protected by an open
country than by mountains, that Spain would be stronger without the Pyrenee=
s;
Lombardy more difficult of access without the Alps, and a level country suc=
h as
North Germany more difficult to conquer than a mountainous country? To thes=
e
false deductions we shall devote our concluding remarks.
</p>

<p>
We do not assert that Spain would be stronger without the Pyrenees than
<i>with</i> them, but we say that a Spanish army, feeling itself strong eno=
ugh
to engage in a decisive battle, would do better by concentrating itself in =
a
position behind the Ebro, than by fractioning itself amongst the fifteen pa=
sses
of the Pyrenees. But the influence of the Pyrenees on war is very far from
being set aside on that account. We say the same respecting an Italian army=
. If
it divided itself in the High Alps it would be vanquished by each resolute
commander it encountered, without even the alternative of victory or defeat=
;
whilst in the plains of Turin it would have the same chance as every other
army. But still no one can on that account suppose that it is desirable for=
 an
aggressor to have to march over masses of mountains such as the Alps, and t=
o
leave them behind. Besides, a determination to accept a great battle in the
plains, by no means excludes a preliminary defence of the mountains by
subordinate forces, an arrangement very advisable in respect to such masses=
 as
the Alps and Pyrenees. Lastly, it is far from our intention to argue that t=
he
conquest of a mountainous country is easier than that of a level(*) one, un=
less
a single victory sufficed to prostrate the enemy completely. After this vic=
tory
ensues a state of defence for the conqueror, during which the mountainous
ground must be as disadvantageous to the assailant as it was to the defensi=
ve,
and even more so. If the war continues, if foreign assistance arrives, if t=
he
people take up arms, this reaction will gain strength from a mountainous
country.

<h3><a name=3D"chap81"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>Defence of Mountains (<i>contin=
ued</i>)</h3>

<p>
In the fifteenth chapter we spoke of the nature of combats in mountains, an=
d in
the sixteenth of the use to be made of them by strategy, and in so doing we
often came upon the idea of <i>mountain defence</i>, without stopping to
consider the form and details of such a measure. We shall now examine it mo=
re
closely.
</p>

<p>
As mountain systems frequently extend like streaks or belts over the surfac=
e of
the earth, and form the division between streams flowing in different
directions, consequently the separation between whole water systems, and as
this general form repeats itself in the parts composing that whole, inasmuc=
h as
these parts diverge from the main chain in branches or ridges, and then for=
m
the separation between lesser water systems; hence the idea of a system of
mountain defence has naturally founded itself in the first instance, and
afterwards developed itself, upon the conception of the general form of
mountains, that of an obstacle, like a great barrier, having greater length
than breadth. Although geologists are not yet agreed as to the origin of
mountains and the laws of their formation, still in every case the course o=
f
the waters indicates in the shortest and surest manner the general form of =
the
system, whether the action of the water has contributed to give that genera=
l
form (according to the aqueous theory), or that the course of the water is =
a
consequence of the form of the system itself. It was, therefore, very natur=
al
again, in devising a system of mountain defence, to take the course of the
waters as a guide, as those courses form a natural series of levels, from w=
hich
we can obtain both the general height and the general profile of the mounta=
in,
while the valleys formed by the streams present also the best means of acce=
ss
to the heights, because so much of the effect of the erosive and alluvial
action of the water is permanent, that the inequalities of the slopes of th=
e
mountain are smoothed down by it to one regular slope. Hence, therefore, th=
e
idea of mountain defence would assume that, when a mountain ran about paral=
lel
with the front to be defended, it was to be regarded as a great obstacle to
approach, as a kind of rampart, the gates of which were formed by the valle=
ys.
The real defence was then to be made on the crest of this rampart, (that is=
, on
the edge of the plateau which crowned the mountain) and cut the valleys
transversely. If the line of the principal mountain-chain formed somewhat o=
f a
right angle with the front of defence, then one of the principal branches w=
ould
be selected to be used instead; thus the line chosen would be parallel to o=
ne
of the principal valleys, and run up to the principal ridge, which might be
regarded as the extremity.
</p>

<p>
We have noticed this scheme for mountain defence founded on the geological
structure of the earth, because it really presented itself in theory for so=
me
time, and in the so-called =E2=80=9Ctheory of ground=E2=80=9D the laws of t=
he
process of aqueous action have been mixed up with the conduct of war.
</p>

<p>
But all this is so full of false hypotheses and incorrect substitutions, th=
at
when these are abstracted, nothing in reality remains to serve as the basis=
 of
any kind of a system.
</p>

<p>
The principal ridges of real mountains are far too impracticable and
inhospitable to place large masses of troops upon them; it is often the sam=
e
with the adjacent ridges, they are often too short and irregular. Plateaux =
do
not exist on all mountain ridges, and where they are to be found they are
mostly narrow, and therefore unfit to accommodate many troops; indeed, ther=
e
are few mountains which, closely examined, will be found surmounted by an
uninterrupted ridge, or which have their sides at such an angle that they f=
orm
in some measure practicable slopes, or, at least, a succession of terraces.=
 The
principal ridge winds, bends, and splits itself; immense branches launch in=
to
the adjacent country in curved lines, and lift themselves often just at the=
ir
termination to a greater height than the main ridge itself; promontories th=
en
join on, and form deep valleys which do not correspond with the general sys=
tem.
Thus it is that, when several lines of mountains cross each other, or at th=
ose
points from which they branch out, the conception of a small band or belt i=
s
completely at an end, and gives place to mountain and water lines radiating
from a centre in the form of a star.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows, and it will strike those who have examined
mountain-masses in this manner the more forcibly, that the idea of a system=
atic
disposition is out of the question, and that to adhere to such an idea as a
fundamental principle for our measures would be wholly impracticable. There=
 is
still one important point to notice belonging to the province of practical
application.
</p>

<p>
If we look closely at mountain warfare in its tactical aspects, it is evide=
nt
that these are of two principal kinds, the first of which is the defence of
steep slopes, the second is that of narrow valleys. Now this last, which is
often, indeed almost generally, highly favourable to the action of the defe=
nce,
is not very compatible with the disposition on the principal ridge, for the
occupation of the valley <i>itself</i> is often required and that at its ou=
ter
extremity nearest to the open country, not at its commencement, because the=
re
its sides are steeper. Besides, this defence of valleys offers a means of
defending mountainous districts, even when the ridge itself affords no posi=
tion
which can be occupied; the r=C3=B4le which it performs is, therefore, gener=
ally
greater in proportion as the masses of the mountains are higher and more
inaccessible.
</p>

<p>
The result of all these considerations is, that we must entirely give up th=
e
idea of a defensible line more or less regular, and coincident with one of =
the
geological lines, and must look upon a mountain range as merely a surface
intersected and broken with inequalities and obstacles strewed over it in t=
he
most diversified manner, the features of which we must try to make the best=
 use
of which circumstances permit; that therefore, although a knowledge of the
geological features of the ground is indispensable to a clear conception of=
 the
form of mountain masses, it is of little value in the organisation of defen=
sive
measures.
</p>

<p>
Neither in the war of the Austrian Succession, nor in the Seven Years=E2=80=
=99
War, nor in those of the French Revolution, do we find military disposition=
s
which comprehended a whole mountain system, and in which the defence was
systematised in accordance with the leading features of that system. Nowher=
e do
we find armies on the principal ridges always in position on the slopes.
Sometimes at a greater, sometimes at a lower elevation; sometimes in one
direction, sometimes in another; parallel, at right angles, and obliquely; =
with
and against the watercourse; in lofty mountains, such as the Alps, frequent=
ly
extended along the valleys; amongst mountains of a inferior class, like the
Sudetics (and this is the strangest anomaly), at the middle of the declivit=
y,
as it sloped towards the defender, therefore with the principal ridge in fr=
ont,
like the position in which Frederick the Great, in 1762, covered the siege =
of
Schwednitz, with the =E2=80=9Chohe Eule=E2=80=9D before the front of his ca=
mp.
</p>

<p>
The celebrated positions, Schmotseifen and Landshut, in the Seven Years=E2=
=80=99
War, are for the most part in the bottoms of valleys. It is the same with t=
he
position of Feldkirch, in the Vorarlsberg. In the campaigns of 1799 and 180=
0,
the chief posts, both of the French and Austrians, were always quite in the
valleys, not merely across them so as to close them, but also parallel with
them, whilst the ridges were either not occupied at all, or merely by a few
single posts.
</p>

<p>
The crests of the higher Alps in particular are so difficult of access, and
afford so little space for the accommodation of troops, that it would be
impossible to place any considerable bodies of men there. Now if we must
positively have armies in mountains to keep possession of them, there is
nothing to be done but to place them in the valleys. At first sight this
appears erroneous, because, in accordance with the prevalent theoretical id=
eas,
it will be said, the heights command the valleys. But that is really not th=
e
case. Mountain ridges are only accessible by a few paths and rude tracks, w=
ith
a few exceptions only passable for infantry, whilst the carriage roads are =
in
the valleys. The enemy can only appear there at certain points with infantr=
y;
but in these mountain masses the distances are too great for any effective =
fire
of small arms, and therefore a position in the valleys is less dangerous th=
an
it appears. At the same time, the valley defence is exposed to another grea=
t
danger, that of being cut off. The enemy can, it is true, only descend into=
 the
valley with infantry, at certain points, slowly and with great exertion; he
cannot, therefore, take us by surprise; but none of the positions we have i=
n
the valley defend the outlets of such paths into the valley. The enemy can,
therefore, bring down large masses gradually, then spread out, and burst
through the thin and from that moment weak line, which, perhaps, has nothin=
g
more for its protection than the rocky bed of a shallow mountain-stream. Bu=
t
now retreat, which must always be made piecemeal in a valley, until the out=
let
from the mountains is reached, is impossible for many parts of the line of
troops; and that was the reason that the Austrians in Switzerland almost al=
ways
lost a third, or a half of their troops taken prisoners.=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
Now a few words on the usual way of dividing troops in such a method of
defence.
</p>

<p>
Each of the subordinate positions is in relation with a position taken up b=
y
the principal body of troops, more or less in the centre of the whole line,=
 on
the principal road of approach. From this central position, other corps are
detached right and left to occupy the most important points of approach, an=
d
thus the whole is disposed in a line, as it were, of three, four, five, six
posts, &amp;c. How far this fractioning and extension of the line shall be
carried, must depend on the requirements of each individual case. An extent=
 of
a couple of marches, that is, six to eight miles is of moderate length, and=
 we
have seen it carried as far as twenty or thirty miles.
</p>

<p>
Between each of these separate posts, which are one or two leagues from eac=
h
other, there will probably be some approaches of inferior importance, to wh=
ich
afterwards attention must be directed. Some very good posts for a couple of
battalions each are selected, which form a good connection between the chie=
f
posts, and they are occupied. It is easy to see that the distribution of th=
e
force may be carried still further, and go down to posts occupied only by
single companies and squadrons; and this has often happened. There are,
therefore, in this no general limits to the extent of fractioning. On the o=
ther
hand, the strength of each post must depend on the strength of the whole; a=
nd
therefore we can say nothing as to the possible or natural degree which sho=
uld
be observed with regard to the strength of the principal posts. We shall on=
ly
append, as a guide, some maxims which are drawn from experience and the nat=
ure
of the case.
</p>

<p>
1. The more lofty and inaccessible the mountains are, so much the further t=
his
separation of divisions of the force not only may be, <i>but also must be</=
i>,
carried; for the less any portion of a country can be kept secure by
combinations dependent on the movement of troops, so much the more must the
security be obtained by direct covering. The defence of the Alps requires a
much greater division of force, and therefore approaches nearer to the cord=
on
system, than the defence of the Vosges or the Giant mountains.
</p>

<p>
2. Hitherto, wherever defence of mountains has taken place, such a division=
 of
the force employed has been made that the chief posts have generally consis=
ted
of only one line of infantry, and in a second line, some squadrons of caval=
ry;
at all events, only the chief post established in the centre has perhaps ha=
d
some battalions in a second line.
</p>

<p>
3. A strategic reserve, to reinforce any point attacked, has very seldom be=
en
kept in rear, because the extension of front made the line feel too weak
already in all parts. On this account the support which a post attacked has
received, has generally been furnished from other posts in the line not
themselves attacked.
</p>

<p>
4. Even when the division of the forces has been relatively moderate, and t=
he
strength of each single post considerable, the principal resistance has bee=
n
always confined to a local defence; and if once the enemy succeeded in wres=
ting
a post, it has been impossible to recover it by any supports afterwards
arriving.
</p>

<p>
How much, according to this, may be expected from mountain defence, in what
cases this means may be used, how far we can and may go in the extension an=
d
fractioning of the forces=E2=80=94these are all questions which theory must=
 leave
to the tact of the general. It is enough if it tells him what these means
really are, and what r=C3=B4le they can perform in the active operations of=
 the
army.
</p>

<p>
A general who allows himself to be beaten in an extended mountain position
deserves to be brought before a court martial.

<h3><a name=3D"chap82"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>Defence of Streams and Rivers<=
/h3>

<p>
Streams and large rivers, in so far as we speak of their defence, belong, l=
ike
mountains, to the category of strategic barriers. But they differ from
mountains in two respects. The one concerns their relative, the other their
absolute defence.
</p>

<p>
Like mountains, they strengthen the relative defence; but one of their
peculiarities is, that they are like implements of hard and brittle metal, =
they
either stand every blow without bending, or their defence breaks and then e=
nds
altogether. If the river is very large, and the other conditions are
favourable, then the passage may be absolutely impossible. But if the defen=
ce
of any river is forced at one point, then there cannot be, as in mountain
warfare, a persistent defence afterwards; the affair is finished with that =
one
act, unless that the river itself runs between mountains.
</p>

<p>
The other peculiarity of rivers in relation to war is, that in many cases t=
hey
admit of very good, and in general of better combinations than mountains fo=
r a
decisive battle.
</p>

<p>
Both again have this property in common, that they are dangerous and seduct=
ive
objects which have often led to false measures, and placed generals in awkw=
ard
situations. We shall notice these results in examining more closely the def=
ence
of rivers.
</p>

<p>
Although history is rather bare in examples of rivers defended with success=
,
and therefore the opinion is justified that rivers and streams are no such
formidable barriers as was once supposed, when an absolute defensive system
seized all means of strengthening itself which the country offered, still t=
he
influence which they exercise to the advantage of the battle, as well as of=
 the
defence of a country, cannot be denied.
</p>

<p>
In order to look over the subject in a connected form, we shall specify the
different points of view from which we propose to examine it.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost, the strategic results which streams and rivers produce
through their defence, must be distinguished from the influence which they =
have
on the defence of a country, even when not themselves specially defended.
</p>

<p>
Further, the defence itself may take three different forms:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. An absolute defence with the main body.
</p>

<p>
2. A mere demonstration of resistance.
</p>

<p>
3. A relative resistance by subordinate bodies of troops, such as outposts,
covering lines, flanking corps, etc.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, we must distinguish three different degrees or kinds of defence, in
each of its forms, namely=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. A direct defence by opposing the passage.
</p>

<p>
2. A rather indirect one, by which the river and its valley are only used a=
s a
means towards a better combination for the battle.
</p>

<p>
3. A completely direct one, by holding an unassailable position on the
enemy=E2=80=99s side of the river.
</p>

<p>
We shall subdivide our observations, in conformity with these three degrees=
,
and after we have made ourselves acquainted with each of them in its relati=
on
to the first, which is the most important of the forms, we shall then proce=
ed
to do the same in respect to their relations to the other two. Therefore,
first, the direct defence, that is, such a defence as is to prevent the pas=
sage
of the enemy=E2=80=99s army itself.
</p>

<p>
This can only come into the question in relation to large rivers, that is,
great bodies of water.
</p>

<p>
The combinations of space, time, and force, which require to be looked into=
 as
elements of this theory of defence, make the subject somewhat complicated, =
so
that it is not easy to gain a sure point from which to commence. The follow=
ing
is the result at which every one will arrive on full consideration.
</p>

<p>
The time required to build a bridge determines the distance from each other=
 at
which the corps charged with the defence of the river should be posted. If =
we
divide the whole length of the line of defence by this distance, we get the
number of corps required for the defence; if with that number we divide the
mass of troops disposable, we shall get the strength of each corps. If we n=
ow
compare the strength of each single corps with the number of troops which t=
he
enemy, by using all the means in his power, can pass over during the
construction of his bridge, we shall be able to judge how far we can expect=
 a
successful resistance. For we can only assume the forcing of the passage to=
 be
impossible when the defender is able to attack the troops passed over with =
a
<i>considerable numerical superiority</i>, say <i>the double</i>, before th=
e
bridge is completed. An illustration will make this plain.
</p>

<p>
If the enemy requires twenty-four hours for the construction of a bridge, a=
nd
if he can by other means only pass over 20,000 men in those twenty-four hou=
rs,
whilst the defender within twelve hours can appear at any point whatever wi=
th
20,000 men, in such case the passage cannot be forced; for the defender wil=
l
arrive when the enemy engaged in crossing has only passed over the half of
20,000. Now as in twelve hours, the time for conveying intelligence include=
d,
we can march four miles, therefore every eight miles 20,000 men would be
required, which would make 60,000 for the defence of a length of twenty-fou=
r
miles of river. These would be sufficient for the appearance of 20,000 men =
at
any point, even if the enemy attempted the passage at two points at the sam=
e
time; if at only one point twice 20,000 could be brought to oppose him at t=
hat
single point.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, there are three circumstances exercising a decisive influence: =
(1)
the breadth of the river; (2) the means of passage, for the two determine b=
oth
the time required to construct the bridge, and the number of troops that ca=
n
cross during the time the bridge is being built; (3) the strength of the
defender=E2=80=99s army. The strength of the enemy=E2=80=99s force itself d=
oes not
as yet come into consideration. According to this theory we may say that th=
ere
is a point at which the possibility of crossing completely stops, and that =
no
numerical superiority on the part of the enemy would enable him to force a
passage.
</p>

<p>
This is the simple theory of the direct defence of a river, that is, of a
defence intended to prevent the enemy from finishing his bridge and from ma=
king
the passage itself; in this there is as yet no notice taken of the effect o=
f
demonstrations which the enemy may use. We shall now bring into considerati=
on
particulars in detail, and measures requisite for such a defence.
</p>

<p>
Setting aside, in the first place, geographical peculiarities, we have only=
 to
say that the corps as proposed by the present theory, must be posted close =
to
the river, and each corps in itself concentrated. It must be close to the
river, because every position further back lengthens unnecessarily and
uselessly the distance to be gone over to any point menaced; for as the wat=
ers
of the river give security against any important movement on the part of th=
e
enemy, a reserve in rear is not required, as it is for an ordinary line of
defence, where there is no river in front. Besides, the roads running paral=
lel
to and near a river up and down, are generally better than transverse roads
from the interior leading to any particular points on the river. Lastly, th=
e
river is unquestionably better watched by corps thus placed than by a mere
chain of posts, more particularly as the commanders are all close at
hand.=E2=80=94Each of these corps must be concentrated in itself, because
otherwise all the calculation as to time would require alteration. He who k=
nows
the loss of time in effecting a concentration, will easily comprehend that =
just
in this concentrated position lies the great efficacy of the defence. No do=
ubt,
at first sight, it is very tempting to make the crossing, even in boats,
impossible for the enemy by a line of posts; but with a few exceptions of
points, specially favourable for crossing, such a measure would be extremel=
y
prejudicial. To say nothing of the objection that the enemy can generally d=
rive
off such a post by bringing a superior force to bear on it from the opposit=
e
side, it is, as a rule, a waste of strength, that is to say, the most that =
can
be obtained by any such post, is to compel the enemy to choose another poin=
t of
passage. If, therefore, we are not so strong that we can treat and defend t=
he
river like a ditch of a fortress, a case for which no new precept is requir=
ed,
such a method of directly defending the bank of a river leads necessarily a=
way
from the proposed object. Besides these general principles for positions, w=
e
have to consider=E2=80=94first, the examination of the special peculiaritie=
s of
the river; second, the removal of all means of passage; third, the influenc=
e of
any fortresses situated on the river.
</p>

<p>
A river, considered as a line of defence, must have at the extremities of t=
he
line, right and left, <i>points d=E2=80=99appui</i>, such as, for instance,=
 the
sea, or a neutral territory; or there must be other causes which make it
impracticable for the enemy to turn the line of defence by crossing beyond =
its
extremities. Now, as neither such flank supports nor such impediments are t=
o be
found, unless at considerable distances, we see at once that the defence of=
 a
river must embrace a considerable portion of its length, and that, therefor=
e,
the possibility of a defence by placing a large body of troops behind a
relatively short length of the river vanishes from the class of possible fa=
cts
(to which we must always confine ourselves). We say <i>a relatively short
length of the river</i>, by which we mean a length which does not very much
exceed that which the same number of troops would usually occupy on an ordi=
nary
position in line without a river. Such cases, we say, do not occur, and eve=
ry
direct defence of a river always becomes a kind of cordon system, at least =
as
far as regards the extension of the troops, and therefore is not at all ada=
pted
to oppose a turning movement on the part of the enemy in the same manner wh=
ich
is natural to an army in a concentrated position. Where, therefore, such
turning movement is possible, the direct defence of the river, however
promising its results in other respects, is a measure in the highest degree
dangerous.
</p>

<p>
Now, as regards the portion of the river between its extreme points, of cou=
rse
we may suppose that all points within that portion are not equally well sui=
ted
for crossing. This subject admits of being somewhat more precisely determin=
ed
in the abstract, but not positively fixed, for the very smallest local
peculiarity often decides more than all which looks great and important in
books. Besides, it is wholly unnecessary to lay down any rules on this subj=
ect,
for the appearance of the river, and the information to be obtained from th=
ose
residing near it, will always amply suffice, without referring back to book=
s.
</p>

<p>
As matters of detail, we may observe that roads leading down upon a river, =
its
affluents, the great towns through which it passes, and lastly above all, i=
ts
islands, generally favour a passage the most; that on the other hand, the
elevation of one bank over another, and the bend in the course of the river=
 at
the point of passage, which usually act such a prominent r=C3=B4le in books=
, are
seldom of any consequence. The reason of this is, that the presumed influen=
ce
of these two things rests on the limited idea of an absolute defence of the
river bank=E2=80=94a case which seldom or never happens in connection with =
great
rivers.
</p>

<p>
Now, whatever may be the nature of the circumstances which make it easier t=
o
cross a river at particular points, they must have an influence on the posi=
tion
of the troops, and modify the general geometrical law; but it is not advisa=
ble
to deviate too far from that law, relying on the difficulties of the passag=
e at
many points. The enemy would choose exactly those spots which are the least
favourable by nature for crossing, if he knew that these are the points whe=
re
there is the least likelihood of meeting us.
</p>

<p>
In any case the strongest possible occupation of islands is a measure to be
recommended, because a serious attack on an island indicates in the surest =
way
the intended point of passage.
</p>

<p>
As the corps stationed close to a river must be able to move either up or d=
own
along its banks according as circumstances require, therefore if there is n=
o
road parallel to the river, one of the most essential preparatory measures =
for
the defence of the river is to put the nearest small roads running in a
parallel direction into suitable order, and to construct such short roads o=
f
connection as may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
The second point on which we have to speak, is the removal of the means of
crossing.=E2=80=94On the river itself the thing is no easy matter, at least
requires considerable time; but on the affluents which fall into the river,
particularly those on the enemy=E2=80=99s side, the difficulties are almost
insurmountable, as these branch rivers are generally already in the hands o=
f
the enemy. For that reason it is important to close the mouths of such rive=
rs
by fortifications.
</p>

<p>
As the equipment for crossing rivers which an enemy brings with him, that i=
s
his pontoons, are rarely sufficient for the passage of great rivers, much
depends on the means to be found on the river itself, its affluents, and in=
 the
great towns adjacent, and lastly, on the timber for building boats and raft=
s in
forests near the river. There are cases in which all these circumstances ar=
e so
unfavourable, that the crossing of a river is by that means almost an
impossibility.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the fortresses, which lie on both sides, or on the enemy=E2=80=99s =
side
of the river, serve both to prevent any crossing at any points near them, u=
p or
down the river, and as a means of closing the mouths of affluents, as well =
as
to receive immediately all craft or boats which may be seized.
</p>

<p>
So much as to the direct defence of a river, on the supposition that it is =
one
containing a great volume of water. If a deep valley with precipitous sides=
 or
marshy banks, are added to the barrier of the river itself, then the diffic=
ulty
of passing and the strength of the defence are certainly increased; but the
volume of water is not made up for by such obstacles, for they constitute n=
o
absolute severance of the country, which is an <i>indispensable</i> conditi=
on
of direct defence.
</p>

<p>
If we are asked what r=C3=B4le such a direct river defence can play in the =
strategic
plan of the campaign, we must admit that it can never lead to a decisive
victory, partly because the object is not to let the enemy pass over to our
side at all, or to crush the first mass of any size which passes; partly
because the river prevents our being able to convert the advantages gained =
into
a decisive victory by sallying forth in force.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the defence of a river in this way may produce a great g=
ain
of time, which is generally all important for the defensive. The collecting=
 the
means of crossing, takes up often much time; if several attempts fail a goo=
d
deal more time is gained. If the enemy, on account of the river, gives his
forces an entirely different direction, then still further advantages may b=
e
gained by that means. Lastly, whenever the enemy is not in downright earnes=
t
about advancing, a river will occasion a stoppage in his movements and ther=
eby
afford a durable protection to the country.
</p>

<p>
A direct defence of a river, therefore, when the masses of troops engaged a=
re
considerable, the river large, and other circumstances favourable, may be
regarded as a very good defensive means, and may yield results to which
commanders in modern times (influenced only by the thought of unfortunate
attempts to defend rivers, which failed from insufficient means), have paid=
 too
little attention. For if, in accordance with the supposition just made (whi=
ch
may easily be realized in connection with such rivers as the Rhine or the
Danube), an efficient defence of 24 miles of river is possible by 60,000 me=
n in
face of a very considerably superior force, we may well say that such a res=
ult
deserves consideration.
</p>

<p>
We say, in opposition to a <i>considerably superior force</i>, and must aga=
in
recur to that point. According to the theory we have propounded, all depend=
s on
the means of crossing, and nothing on the numerical strength of the force
seeking to cross, always supposing it is not less than the force which defe=
nds
the river. This appears very extraordinary, and yet it is true. But we must
take care not to forget that most defences of rivers, or, more properly
speaking, the whole, have no absolute <i>points d=E2=80=99appui</i>, theref=
ore,
may be turned, and this turning movement will be very much easier if the en=
emy
has very superior numbers.
</p>

<p>
If now we reflect that such a direct defence of a river, even if overcome b=
y
the enemy, is by no means to be compared to a lost battle, and can still le=
ss
lead to a complete defeat, since only a part of our force has been engaged,=
 and
the enemy, detained by the tedious crossing over of his troops on a single
bridge, cannot immediately follow up his victory, we shall be the less disp=
osed
to despise this means of defence.
</p>

<p>
In all the practical affairs of human life it is important to hit the right
point; and so also, in the defence of a river, it makes a great difference
whether we rightly appreciate our situation in all its relations; an appare=
ntly
insignificant circumstance may essentially alter the case, and make a measu=
re
which is wise and effective in one instance, a disastrous mistake in anothe=
r.
This difficulty of forming a right judgment and of avoiding the notion that
=E2=80=9Ca river is a river=E2=80=9D is perhaps greater here than anywhere =
else,
therefore we must especially guard against false applications and
interpretations; but having done so, we have also no hesitation in plainly
declaring that we do not think it worth while to listen to the cry of those
who, under the influence of some vague feeling, and without any fixed idea,
expect everything from attack and movement, and think they see the most tru=
e
picture of war in a hussar at full gallop brandishing his sword over his he=
ad.
</p>

<p>
Such ideas and feelings are not always all that is required (we shall only
instance here the once famous dictator Wedel, at Z=C3=BCllichau, in 1759); =
but the
worst of all is that they are seldom durable, and they forsake the general =
at
the last moment if great complex cases branching out into a thousand relati=
ons
bear heavily upon him.
</p>

<p>
We therefore believe that a direct defence of a river with large bodies of
troops, under favourable conditions, can lead to successful results if we
content ourselves with a moderate negative: but this does not hold good in =
the
case of smaller masses. Although 60,000 men on a certain length of river co=
uld
prevent an army of 100,000 or more from passing, a corps of 10,000 on the s=
ame
length would not be able to oppose the passage of a corps of 10,000 men,
indeed, probably, not of one half that strength if such a body chose to run=
 the
risk of placing itself on the same side of the river with an enemy so much
superior in numbers. The case is clear, as the means of passing do not alte=
r.
</p>

<p>
We have as yet said little about feints or demonstrations of crossing, as t=
hey
do not essentially come into consideration in the direct defence of a river=
,
for partly such defence is not a question of concentration of the army at o=
ne
point, but each corps has the defence of a portion of the river distinctly
allotted to it; partly such simulated intentions of crossing are also very
difficult under the circumstances we have supposed. If, for instance, the m=
eans
of crossing in themselves are already limited, that is, not in such abundan=
ce
as the assailant must desire to ensure the success of his undertaking, he w=
ill
then hardly be able or willing to apply a large share to a mere demonstrati=
on:
at all events the mass of troops to be passed over at the true point of
crossing must be so much the less, and the defender gains again in time wha=
t
through uncertainty he may have lost.
</p>

<p>
This direct defence, as a rule, seems only suitable to large rivers, and on=
 the
last half of their course.
</p>

<p>
The second form of defence is suitable for smaller rivers with deep valleys=
,
often also for very unimportant ones. It consists in a position taken up
further back from the river at such a distance that the enemy=E2=80=99s arm=
y may
either be caught in detail after the passage (if it passes at several point=
s at
the same time) or if the passage is made by the whole at one point, then ne=
ar
the river, hemmed in upon one bridge and road. An army with the rear presse=
d
close against a river or a deep valley, and confined to one line of retreat=
, is
in a most disadvantageous position for battle; in the making proper use of =
this
circumstance, consists precisely the most efficacious defence of rivers of
moderate size, and running in deep valleys.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of an army in large corps close to a river which we conside=
r
the best in a direct defence, supposes that the enemy cannot pass the river
unexpectedly and in great force, because otherwise, by making such a
disposition, there would be great danger of being beaten in detail. If,
therefore, the circumstances which favour the defence are not sufficiently
advantageous, if the enemy has already in hand ample means of crossing, if =
the
river has many islands or fords, if it is not broad enough, if we are too w=
eak,
etc., etc., then the idea of that method may be dismissed: the troops for t=
he
more secure connection with each other must be drawn back a little from the
river, and all that then remains to do is to ensure the most rapid
concentration possible upon that point where the enemy attempts to cross, s=
o as
to be able to attack him before he has gained so much ground that he has th=
e
command of several passages. In the present case the river or its valley mu=
st
be watched and partially defended by a chain of outposts whilst the army is
disposed in several corps at suitable points and at a certain distance (usu=
ally
a few leagues) from the river.
</p>

<p>
The most difficult point lies here in the passage through the narrow way fo=
rmed
by the river and its valley. It is not now only the volume of water in the
river with which we are concerned, but the whole of the defile, and, as a r=
ule,
a deep rocky valley is a greater impediment to pass than a river of
considerable breadth. The difficulty of the march of a large body of troops
through a long defile is in reality much greater than appears at first
consideration. The time required is very considerable; and the danger that =
the
enemy during the march may make himself master of the surrounding heights m=
ust
cause disquietude. If the troops in front advance too far, they encounter t=
he
enemy too soon, and are in danger of being overpowered; if they remain near=
 the
point of passage then they fight in the worst situation. The passage across
such an obstacle of ground with a view to measure strength with the enemy o=
n
the opposite side is, therefore, a bold undertaking, or it implies very
superior numbers and great confidence in the commander.
</p>

<p>
Such a defensive line cannot certainly be extended to such a length as in t=
he
direct defence of a great river, for it is intended to fight with the whole
force united, and the passages, however difficult, cannot be compared in th=
at
respect with those over a large river; it is, therefore, much easier for th=
e
enemy to make a turning movement against us. But at the same time, such a
movement carries him out of his natural direction (for we suppose, as is pl=
ain
in itself, that the valley crosses that direction at about right angles), a=
nd
the disadvantageous effect of a confined line of retreat only disappears
gradually, not at once, so that the defender will still always have some
advantage over the advancing foe, although the latter is not caught exactly=
 at
the crisis of the passage, but by the detour he makes is enabled to get a
little more room to move.
</p>

<p>
As we are not speaking of rivers in connection only with the mass of their
waters, but have rather more in view the deep cleft or channel formed by th=
eir
valleys, we must explain that under the term we do not mean any regular
mountain gorge, because then all that has been said about mountains would b=
e
applicable. But, as every one knows, there are many level districts where t=
he
channels of even the smallest streams have deep and precipitous sides; and,
besides these, such as have marshy banks, or whose banks are otherwise
difficult of approach, belong to the same class.
</p>

<p>
Under these conditions, therefore, an army on the defensive, posted behind =
a
large river or deep valley with steep sides, is in a very excellent positio=
n,
and this sort of river defence is a strategic measure of the best kind.
</p>

<p>
Its defect (the point on which the defender is very apt to err) is the
over-extension of the defending force. It is so natural in such a case to b=
e
drawn on from one point of passage to another, and to miss the right point
where we ought to stop; but then, if we do not succeed in fighting with the
whole army united, we miss the intended effect; a defeat in battle, the
necessity of retreat, confusion in many ways and losses reduce the army nea=
rly
to ruin, even although the resistance has not been pushed to an extremity.
</p>

<p>
In saying that the defensive, under the above conditions, should not extend=
 his
forces widely, that he should be in any case able to assemble all his force=
s on
the evening of the day on which the enemy passes, enough is said, and it ma=
y
stand in place of all combinations of time, power, and space, things which,=
 in
this case, must depend on many local points.
</p>

<p>
The battle to which these circumstances lead must have a special
character=E2=80=94that of the greatest impetuosity on the side of the defen=
der.
The feigned passages by which the enemy will keep him for some time in
uncertainty=E2=80=94will, in general prevent his discovering the real point=
 of
crossing a moment too soon. The peculiar advantages of the situation of the
defender consist in the disadvantageous situation of the enemy=E2=80=99s co=
rps
just immediately in his front; if other corps, having passed at other point=
s,
menace his flank, he cannot, as in a defensive battle, counteract such
movements by vigorous blows from his rear, for that would be to sacrifice t=
he
above-mentioned advantage of his situation; he must, therefore, decide the
affair in his front before such other corps can arrive and become dangerous=
,
that is, he must attack what he has before him as swiftly and vigorously as
possible, and decide all by its defeat.
</p>

<p>
But the object of <i>this</i> form of river defence can never be the repuls=
e of
a very greatly superior force, as is conceivable in the direct defence of a
large river; for as a rule we have really to deal with the bulk of the
enemy=E2=80=99s force, and although we do so under favourable circumstances=
,
still it is easy to see the relation between the forces must soon be felt.
</p>

<p>
This is the nature of the defence of rivers of a moderate size and deep val=
leys
when the principal masses of the armies are concerned, for in respect to th=
em
the considerable resistance which can be offered on the ridges or scarps of=
 the
valley stands no comparison with the disadvantages of a scattered position,=
 and
to them a decisive victory is a matter of necessity. But if nothing more is
wanted but the reinforcement of a secondary line of defence which is intend=
ed
to hold out for a short time, and which can calculate on support, then
certainly a direct defence of the scarps of the valley, or even of the rive=
r
bank, may be made; and although the same advantages are not to be expected =
here
as in mountain positions, still the resistance will always last longer than=
 in
an ordinary country. Only one circumstance makes this measure very dangerou=
s,
if not impossible: it is when the river has many windings and sharp turning=
s,
which is just what is often the case when a river runs in a deep valley, On=
ly
look at the course of the Mosel. In a case of its defence, the corps in adv=
ance
on the salients of the bends would almost inevitably be lost in the event o=
f a
retreat.
</p>

<p>
That a great river allows the same defensive means, the same form of defenc=
e,
which we have pointed out as best suited for rivers of a moderate size, in
connection with the mass of an army, and also under much more favourable
circumstances, is plain of itself. It will come into use more especially wh=
en
the point with the defender is to gain a decisive victory (Aspern).
</p>

<p>
The case of an army drawn up with its front close on a river, or stream, or
deep valley, in order by that means to command a tactical obstacle to the
approach to its position, or to strengthen its front, is quite a different =
one,
the detailed examination of which belongs to tactics. Of the effect of this=
 we
shall only say this much, that it is founded on a delusion.=E2=80=94If the =
cleft
in the ground is very considerable, the front of the position becomes
absolutely unassailable. Now, as there is no more difficulty in passing rou=
nd
such a position than any other, it is just the same as if the defender had
himself gone out of the way of the assailant, yet that could hardly be the
object of the position. A position of this kind can, therefore, only be
advisable when, as a consequence of its position, it threatens the
communications of the assailant, so that every deviation by him from the di=
rect
road is fraught with consequences altogether too serious to be risked.
</p>

<p>
In this second form of defence, feigned passages are much more dangerous, f=
or
the assailant can make them more easily, while, on the other hand, the
proposition for the defender is, to assemble his whole army at the right po=
int.
But the defender is certainly not quite so much limited for time here, beca=
use
the advantage of his situation lasts until the assailant has massed his who=
le
force, and made himself master of several crossings; moreover, also, the
simulated attack has not the same degree of effect here as in the defence o=
f a
cordon, where all must be held, and where, therefore, in the application of=
 the
reserve, it is not merely a question, as in our proposition, where the enem=
y
has his principal force, but the much more difficult one, Which is the poin=
t he
will first seek to force?
</p>

<p>
With respect to both forms of defence of large and small rivers, we must
observe generally, that if they are undertaken in the haste and confusion o=
f a
retreat, without preparation, without the removal of all means of passage, =
and
without an exact knowledge of the country, they cannot certainly fulfil wha=
t
has been here supposed; in most such cases, nothing of the kind is to be
calculated upon; and therefore it will be always a great error for an army =
to
divide itself over extended positions.
</p>

<p>
As everything usually miscarries in war, if it is not done upon clear
convictions and with the whole will and energy, so a <i>river defence</i> w=
ill
generally end badly when it is only resorted to because we have not the hea=
rt
to meet the enemy in the open field, and hope that the broad river or the d=
eep
valley will stop him. When that is the case, there is so little confidence =
in
the actual situation that both the general and his army are usually filled =
with
anxious forebodings, which are almost sure to be realized quick enough. A
battle in the open field does not suppose a perfectly equal state of
circumstances beforehand, like a duel; and the defender who does not know h=
ow
to gain for himself any advantages, either through the special nature of th=
e
defence, through rapid marches, or by knowledge of the country and freedom =
of
movement, is one whom nothing can save, and least of all will a river or it=
s
valley be able to help him.
</p>

<p>
The third form of defence=E2=80=94by a strong position taken up on the
enemy=E2=80=99s side of the river=E2=80=94founds its efficacy on the danger=
 in
which it places the enemy of having his communications cut by the river, an=
d
being thus limited to some bridges. It follows, as a matter of course, that=
 we
are only speaking of great rivers with a great volume of water, as these al=
one
can lead to such results, whilst a river which is merely in a deep ravine
usually affords such a number of passages that all danger of the above
disappears.
</p>

<p>
But the position of the defensive must be very strong, almost unassailable;
otherwise he would just meet the enemy half way, and give up his advantages=
.
But if it is of such strength that the enemy resolves not to attack it, he
will, under certain circumstances, be confined thereby to the same bank wit=
h
the defender. If the assailant crosses, he exposes his communications; but
certainly, at the same time, he threatens ours. Here, as in all cases in wh=
ich
one army passes by another, the great point is, whose communications, by th=
eir
number, situation, and other circumstances, are the best secured, and which=
 has
also, in other respects, most to lose, therefore can be outbid by his oppon=
ent;
lastly, which possesses still in his army the most power of victory upon wh=
ich
he can depend in an extreme case. The influence of the river merely amounts=
 to
this, that it augments the danger of such a movement for both parties, as b=
oth
are dependent on bridges. Now, in so far as we can assume that, according t=
o
the usual course of things, the passage of the defender, as well as of his
dep=C3=B4ts of all kinds, are better secured by fortresses than those of th=
e
offensive, in so far is such a defence conceivable, and one which might be
substituted for the direct defence when circumstances are not favourable to
that form. Certainly then the river is not defended by the army, nor the ar=
my
by the river, but by the connection between the two the country is defended=
,
which is the main point.
</p>

<p>
At the same time it must be granted that this mode of defence, without a
decisive blow, and resembling the state of tension of two electric currents=
, of
which the atmospheres only are as yet in contact, cannot stop any very powe=
rful
impulsive force. It might be applicable against even a great superiority of
force on the side of the enemy, if their army is commanded by a cautious
general, wanting in decision, and never disposed to push forward with energ=
y;
it might also answer when a kind of oscillation towards equality between th=
e
contending forces has previously arisen, and nothing but small advantages a=
re
looked for on either side. But if we have to deal with superior forces, led=
 by
a bold general, we are upon a dangerous course, very close to an abyss.
</p>

<p>
This form of defence looks so bold, and at the same time so scientific, tha=
t it
might be called the elegant; but as elegance easily merges into folly, and =
as
it is not so easily excused in war as in society, therefore we have had as =
yet
few instances of this elegant art. From this third mode a special means of
assistance for the first two forms is developed, that is, by the permanent
occupation of a bridge and a <i>t=C3=AAte du pont</i> to keep up a constant=
 threat
of crossing.
</p>

<p>
Besides the object of an absolute defence with the main body, each of the t=
hree
modes of defence may also have that of a <i>feigned defence</i>.
</p>

<p>
This show of a resistance, which it is not intended really to offer, is an =
act
which is combined with many other measures, and fundamentally with every
position which is anything more than a camp of route; but the feigned defen=
ce
of a great river becomes a complete stratagem in this way, that it is neces=
sary
to adopt actually more or less a number of measures of detail, and that its
action is usually on a greater scale and of longer duration than that of an=
y
other; for the act of passing a great river in sight of an army is always a=
n
important step for the assailant, one over which he often ponders long, or
which he postpones to a more favourable moment.
</p>

<p>
For such a feigned defence it is therefore requisite that the main army sho=
uld
divide and post itself along the river, (much in the same manner as for a r=
eal
defence); but as the intention of a mere demonstration shows that circumsta=
nces
are not favourable enough for a real defence, therefore, from that measure =
as
it always occasions a more or less extended and scattered disposition, the
danger of serious loss may very easily arise if the corps should get engage=
d in
a real resistance, even if not carried to an extremity; it would then be in=
 the
true sense a half measure. In a demonstration of defence, therefore,
arrangement must be made for a sure concentration of the army at a point
considerably (perhaps several days=E2=80=99 march) in rear, and the defence
should not be carried beyond what is consistent with this arrangement.
</p>

<p>
In order to make our views plainer, and to show the importance of such a
defensive demonstration, let us refer to the end of the campaign of 1813.
Buonaparte repassed the Rhine with forty or fifty thousand men. To attempt =
to
defend this river with such a force at all points where the Allies, accordi=
ng
to the direction of their forces, might easily pass, that is, between Manhe=
im
and Nimeguen, would have been to attempt an impossibility. The only idea wh=
ich
Buonaparte could therefore entertain was to offer his first real resistance
somewhere on the French Meuse, where he could make his appearance with his =
army
in some measure reinforced. Had he at once withdrawn his forces to that poi=
nt,
the Allies would have followed close at his heels; had he placed his army i=
n
cantonments for rest behind the Rhine, the same thing must have taken place
almost as soon, for at the least show of desponding caution on his part, th=
e
Allies would have sent over swarms of Cossacks and other light troops in
pursuit, and, if that measure produced good results, other corps would have
followed. The French corps had therefore nothing for it but to take steps t=
o
defend the Rhine in earnest. As Buonaparte could foresee that this defence =
must
end in nothing whenever, the Allies seriously undertook to cross the river,=
 it
may therefore be regarded in the light of a mere demonstration, in which th=
e
French corps incurred hardly any danger, as their point of concentration la=
y on
the Upper Moselle. Only Macdonald, who, as is known, was at Nimeguen with
twenty thousand men, committed a mistake in deferring his retreat till fair=
ly
compelled to retire, for this delay prevented his joining Buonaparte before=
 the
battle of Brienne, as the retreat was not forced on him until after the arr=
ival
of Winzurgerode=E2=80=99s corps in January. This defensive demonstration on=
 the
Rhine, therefore, produced the result of checking the Allies in their advan=
ce,
and induced them to postpone the crossing of the river until their
reinforcements arrived, which did not take place for six weeks. These six w=
eeks
were of infinite value to Buonaparte. Without this defensive demonstration =
on
the Rhine, Paris would have become the next immediate object after the vict=
ory
of Leipsic, and it would have been impossible for the French to have given
battle on that side of their capital.
</p>

<p>
In a river defence of the second class, therefore, in that of rivers of a
smaller size, such demonstrations may also be used, but they will generally=
 be
less effectual, because mere attempts to cross are in such a case easier, a=
nd
therefore the spell is sooner broken.
</p>

<p>
In the third kind of river defence, a demonstration would in all probabilit=
y be
still less effectual, and produce no more result than that of the occupatio=
n of
any other temporary position.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the two first forms of defence are very well suited to give a chain=
 of
outposts, or any other defensive line (cordon) established for a secondary
object, or to a corps of observation, much greater and more reliable streng=
th
than it would have without the river. In all these cases the question is
limited to a relative resistance, and that must naturally be considerably
strengthened by such a great natural obstacle. At the same time, we must no=
t
think only of the relative quantity of time gained by the resistance in fig=
ht
in a case of this sort, but also of the many anxieties which such undertaki=
ngs
usually excite in the mind of the enemy, and which in ninety-nine cases out=
 of
a hundred lead to his giving up his plans if not urged or pressed by necess=
ity.

<h3><a name=3D"chap83"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br>Defence of Streams and Rivers (<=
i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>
We have still to add something respecting the influence of streams and rive=
rs
on the defence of a country, even when they are not themselves defended.
</p>

<p>
Every important river, with its main valley and its adjacent valleys, forms=
 a
very considerable obstacle in a country, and in that way it is, therefore,
advantageous to defence in general; but its peculiar influence admits of be=
ing
more particularly specified in its principal effects.
</p>

<p>
First we must distinguish whether it flows parallel to the frontier, that i=
s,
the general strategic front, or at an oblique or a right angle to it. In th=
e
case of the parallel direction we must observe the difference between havin=
g
our own army or that of the enemy behind it, and in both cases again the
distance between it and the army.
</p>

<p>
An army on the defensive, having behind it a large river within easy reach =
(but
not less than a day=E2=80=99s march), and on that river an adequate number =
of
secure crossings, is unquestionably in a much stronger situation than it wo=
uld
be without the river; for if it loses a little in freedom of movement by th=
e
requisite care for the security of the crossings, still it gains much more =
by
the security of its strategic rear, that means chiefly of its lines of
communication. In all this we allude to a defence in <i>our own country;</i=
>
for in the enemy=E2=80=99s country, although his army might be before us, w=
e
should still have always more or less to apprehend his appearance behind us=
 on
the other side of the river, and then the river, involving as it does narro=
w
defiles in roads, would be more disadvantageous than otherwise in its effec=
t on
our situation. The further the river is behind the army, the less useful it
will be, and at certain distances its influence disappears altogether.
</p>

<p>
If an advancing army has to leave a river in its rear, the river cannot be
otherwise than prejudicial to its movements, for it restricts the
communications of the army to a few single passages. When Prince Henry marc=
hed
against the Russians on the right bank of the Oder near Breslau, he had pla=
inly
a <i>point d=E2=80=99appui</i> in the Oder flowing behind him at a day=E2=
=80=99s
march; on the other hand, when the Russians under Cznernitschef passed the =
Oder
subsequently, they were in a very embarrassing situation, just through the =
risk
of losing their line of retreat, which was limited to one bridge.
</p>

<p>
If a river crosses the theatre of war more or less at a right angle with th=
e
strategic front, then the advantage is again on the side of the defensive; =
for,
in the first place, there are generally a number of good positions leaning =
on
the river, and covered in front by the transverse valleys connected with th=
e
principal valley (like the Elbe for the Prussians in the Seven Years=E2=80=
=99
War); secondly, the assailant must leave one side of the river or the other
unoccupied, or he must divide his forces; and such division cannot fail to =
be
in favour again of the defensive, because he will be in possession of more =
well
secured passages than the assailant. We need only cast a glance over the wh=
ole
Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, to be convinced that the Oder and Elbe were very =
useful
to Frederick the Great in the defence of his theatre of war (namely Silesia=
,
Saxony and the Mark), and consequently a great impediment to the conquest o=
f
these provinces by the Austrians and Russians, although there was no real
defence of those rivers in the whole Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, and their co=
urse
is mostly, as connected with the enemy, at an oblique or a right angle rath=
er
than parallel with the front.
</p>

<p>
It is only the convenience of a river as a means of transport, when its cou=
rse
is more or less in a perpendicular direction, which can, in general, be
advantageous to the assailant; in that respect it may be so for this reason=
,
that as he has the longer line of communication, and, therefore, the greate=
r
difficulty in the transport of all he requires, water carriage may relieve =
him
of a great deal of trouble and prove very useful. The defender, on his side=
,
certainly has it in his power to close the navigation within his own fronti=
er
by fortresses; still even by that means the advantages which the river affo=
rds
the assailant will not be lost so far as regards its course up to that
frontier. But if we reflect upon the fact that many rivers are often not
navigable, even where they are of no unimportant breadth as respects other
military relations, that others are not navigable at all seasons, that the
ascent against the stream is tedious, that the winding of a river often dou=
bles
its length, that the chief communications between countries now are high ro=
ads,
and that now more than ever the wants of an army are supplied from the coun=
try
adjacent to the scene of its operations, and not by carriage from distant
parts,=E2=80=94we can well see that the use of a river does not generally p=
lay
such a prominent part in the subsistence of troops as is usually represente=
d in
books, and that its influence on the march of events is therefore very remo=
te
and uncertain.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap84"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br>A. Defence of Swamps</h3>

<p>
Very large wide swamps, such as the Bourtang Moor in North Germany, are so
uncommon that it is not worth while to lose time over them; but we must not
forget that certain lowlands and marshy banks of small rivers are more comm=
on,
and form very considerable obstacles of ground which may be, and often have
been, used for defensive purposes.
</p>

<p>
Measures for their defence are certainly very like those for the defence of
rivers, at the same time there are some peculiarties to be specially notice=
d.
The first and principal one is, that a marsh which except on the causeway i=
s
impracticable for infantry is much more difficult to cross than any river; =
for,
in the first place, a causeway is not so soon built as a bridge; secondly,
there are no means at hand by which the troops to cover the construction of=
 the
dyke or causeway can be sent across. No one would begin to build a bridge
without using some of the boats to send over an advanced guard in the first
instance; but in the case of a morass no similar assistance can be employed=
;
the easiest way to make a crossing for infantry over a morass is by means o=
f
planks, but when the morass is of some width, this is a much more tedious
process than the crossing of the first boats on a river. If now, besides, t=
here
is in the middle of the morass a river which cannot be passed without a bri=
dge,
the crossing of the first detachment of troops becomes a still more difficu=
lt
affair, for although single passengers may get across on boards, the heavy
material required for bridge building cannot be so transported. This diffic=
ulty
on many occasions may be insurmountable.
</p>

<p>
A second peculiarity of a swamp is, that the means used to cross cannot be
completely removed like those, used for passing a river; bridges may be bro=
ken,
or so completely destroyed that they can never be used again; the most that=
 can
be done with dykes is to cut them, which is not doing much. If there is a r=
iver
in the middle, the bridge can of course be taken away, but the whole passag=
e
will not by that means be destroyed in the same degree as that of a large r=
iver
by the destruction of a bridge. The natural consequence is that dykes which
exist must always be occupied in force and strenuously defended if we desir=
e to
derive any general advantage from the morass.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, therefore, we are compelled to adopt a local defence, and =
on
the other, such a defence is favoured by the difficulty of passing at other
parts. From these two peculiarities the result is, that the defence of a sw=
amp
must be more local and passive than that of a river.
</p>

<p>
It follows from this that we must be stronger in a relative degree than in =
the
direct defence of a river, consequently that the line of defence must not b=
e of
great length, especially in cultivated countries, where the number of passa=
ges,
even under the most favourable circumstances for defence, is still very gre=
at.
</p>

<p>
In this respect, therefore, swamps are inferior to great rivers, and this i=
s a
point of great importance, for all local defence is illusory and dangerous =
to
an extreme. But if we reflect that such swamps and low grounds generally ha=
ve a
breadth with which that of the largest rivers in Europe bears no comparison=
,
and that consequently a post stationed for the defence of a passage is neve=
r in
danger of being overpowered by the fire from the other side, that the effec=
ts
of its own fire over a long narrow dyke is greatly increased, and that the =
time
required to pass such a defile, perhaps a quarter or half a mile long, is m=
uch
longer than would suffice to pass an ordinary bridge: if we consider all th=
is,
we must admit that such low lands and morasses, if means of crossing are no=
t
too numerous, belong to the strongest lines of defence which can be formed.
</p>

<p>
An indirect defence, such as we made ourselves acquainted with in the case =
of
streams and rivers, in which obstacles of ground are made use of to bring o=
n a
great battle under advantageous circumstances, is generally quite as applic=
able
to morasses.
</p>

<p>
The third method of a river-defence by means of a position on the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
side would be too hazardous on account of the toilsome nature of the crossi=
ng.
</p>

<p>
It is extremely dangerous to venture on the defence of such morasses, soft
meadows, bogs, etc., as are not quite impassable beyond the dykes. One sing=
le
line of crossing discovered by the enemy is sufficient to pierce the whole =
line
of defence which, in case of a serious resistance, is always attended with
great loss to the defender.

<h3><a name=3D"chap85"></a>B. Inundations</h3>

<p>
Now we have still to consider inundations. As defensive means and also as
phenomena in the natural world they have unquestionably the nearest resembl=
ance
to morasses.
</p>

<p>
They are not common certainly; perhaps Holland is the only country in Europ=
e
where they constitute a phenomenon which makes them worth notice in connect=
ion
with our object; but just that country, on account of the remarkable campai=
gns
of 1672 and 1787, as well as on account of its important relation in itself=
 to
both France and Germany, obliges us to devote some consideration to this
matter.
</p>

<p>
The character of these Dutch inundations differs from ordinary swampy and
impassable wet low lands in the following respects:
</p>

<p>
1. The soil itself is dry and consists either of dry meadows or of cultivat=
ed
fields.
</p>

<p>
2. For purposes of irrigation or of drainage, a number of small ditches of
greater or loss depth and breadth intersect the country in such a way that =
they
may be seen running in lines in parallel directions.
</p>

<p>
3. Larger canals, inclosed by dykes and intended for irrigation, drainage, =
and
transit of vessels, run through the country in all possible directions and =
are
of such a size that they can only be passed on bridges.
</p>

<p>
4. The level of the ground throughout the whole district subject to inundat=
ion,
lies perceptibly under the level of the sea, therefore, of course, under th=
at
of the canals.
</p>

<p>
5. The consequence of this is, that by means of cutting the dams, closing a=
nd
opening the sluices, the whole country can be laid under water, so that the=
re
are no dry roads except on the tops of the dykes, all others being either
entirely under water or, at least, so soaked that they become no longer fit=
 for
use. Now, if even the inundation is only three or four feet deep, so that,
perhaps, for short distances it might be waded through, still even that is =
made
impossible on account of the smaller ditches mentioned under No. 2, which a=
re
not visible. It is only where these ditches have a corresponding direction,=
 so
that we can move between two of them without crossing either, that the
inundation does not constitute in effect an absolute bar to all communicati=
on.
It is easy to conceive that this exception to the general obstruction can o=
nly
be for short distances, and, therefore, can only be used for tactical purpo=
ses
of an entirely special character.
</p>

<p>
From all this we deduce
</p>

<p>
1. That the assailant=E2=80=99s means of moving are limited to a more or le=
ss
small number of practicable lines, which run along very narrow dykes, and
usually have a wet ditch on the right and left, consequently form very long
defiles.
</p>

<p>
2. That every defensive preparation upon such a dam may be easily strengthe=
ned
to such a degree as to become impregnable.
</p>

<p>
3. But that, because the defensive is so hemmed in, he must confine himself=
 to
the most passive resistance as respects each isolated point, and consequent=
ly
must look for his safety entirely from passive resistance.
</p>

<p>
4. That in such a country it is not a system of a single defensive line,
closing the country like a simple barrier, but that as in every direction t=
he
same obstacle to movement exists, and the same security for flanks may be
found, new posts may incessantly be formed, and in this manner any portion =
of
the first defensive line, if lost, may be replaced by a new piece. We may s=
ay
that the number of combinations here, like those on a chessboard, are infin=
ite.
</p>

<p>
5. But while this general condition of a country is only conceivable along =
with
the supposition of a high degree of cultivation and a dense population, it
follows of itself that the number of passages, and therefore the number of
posts required or their defence, must be very great in comparison to other
strategetic dispositions; from which again we have, as a consequence, that =
such
a defensive line must not be long.
</p>

<p>
The principal line of defence in Holland is from Naarden on the Zuyder Zee =
(the
greater part of the way behind the Vecht), to Gorcum on the Waal, that is
properly to the Biesbosch, its extent being about eight miles. For the defe=
nce
of this line a force of 25,000 to 30,000 was employed in 1672, and again in
1787. If we could reckon with certainty upon an invincible resistance, the
results would certainly be very great, at least for the provinces of Hollan=
d
lying behind that line.
</p>

<p>
In 1672 the line actually withstood very superior forces led by great gener=
als,
first Cond=C3=A9, and afterwards Luxembourg, who had under their command 40=
,000 to
50,000 men, and yet would not assault, preferring to wait for the winter, w=
hich
did not prove severe enough. On the other hand, the resistance which was ma=
de
on this first line in 1787 amounted to nothing, and even that which was mad=
e by
a second line much shorter, between the Zuyder Zee and the lake of Haarlem,
although somewhat more effective, was overcome by the Duke of Brunswick in =
one
day, through a very skilful tactical disposition well adapted to the locali=
ty,
and this although the Prussian force actually engaged in the attack was lit=
tle,
if at all, superior in numbers to the troops guarding the lines.
</p>

<p>
The different result in the two cases is to be attributed to the difference=
 in
the supreme command. In the year 1672 the Dutch were surprised by Louis XIV=
.,
while everything was on a peace establishment, in which, as is well known,
there breathed very little military spirit as far as concerned land forces.=
 For
that reason the greater number of the fortresses were deficient in all arti=
cles
of material and equipment, garrisoned only by weak bodies of hired troops, =
and
defended by governors who were either native-born incapables, or treacherou=
s
foreigners. Thus all the Brandenburg fortresses on the Rhine, garrisoned by
Dutch, as well as all their own places situated to the east of the line of
defence above described, except Groningen, very soon fell into the hands of=
 the
French, and for the most part without any real defence. And in the conquest=
 of
this great number of places consisted the chief exertions of the French arm=
y,
150,000 strong, at that time.
</p>

<p>
But when, after the murder of the brothers De Witt, in August 1672, the Pri=
nce
of Orange came to the head of affairs, bringing unity to the measures for
national defence, there was still time to close the defensive line
above-mentioned, and all the measures then adopted harmonised so well with =
each
other that neither Cond=C3=A9 nor Luxembourg, who commanded the French armi=
es left
in Holland after the departure of the two armies under Turenne and Louis in
person, would venture to attempt anything against the separate posts.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1787 all was different. It was not the Republic of seven united
provinces, but only the province of Holland which had to resist the invasio=
n.
The conquest of all the fortresses, which had been the principal object in
1672, was therefore not the question; the defence was confined at once to t=
he
line we have described. But the assailant this time, instead of 150,000 men=
,
had only 25,000, and was no mighty sovereign of a great country adjoining
Holland, but the subordinate general of a distant prince, himself by no mea=
ns
independent in many respects. The people in Holland, like those everywhere =
else
at that time, were divided into two parties, but the republican spirit in
Holland was decidedly predominant, and had at the same time attained even t=
o a
kind of enthusiastic excitement. Under these circumstances the resistance i=
n
the year 1787 ought to have ensured at least as great results as that of 16=
72.
But there was one important difference, which is, that in the year 1787 uni=
ty
of command was entirely wanting. What in 1672 had been left to the wise,
skilful, and energetic guidance of the Prince of Orange, was entrusted to a=
 so
called Defence Commission in 1787, which although it included in its number=
 men
of energy, was not in a position to infuse into its work the requisite unit=
y of
measures, and to inspire others with that confidence which was wanted to
prevent the whole instrument from proving imperfect and inefficient in use.
</p>

<p>
We have dwelt for a moment on this example, in order to give more distinctn=
ess
to the conception of this defensive measure, and at the same time to show t=
he
difference in the effects produced, according as more or less unity and
sequence prevail in the direction of the whole.
</p>

<p>
Although the organisation and method of defence of such a defensive line ar=
e
tactical subjects, still, in connection with the latter, which is the neare=
st
allied to strategy, we cannot omit to make an observation to which the camp=
aign
of 1787 gives occasion.
</p>

<p>
We think, namely, that however passive the defence must naturally be at eac=
h
point in a line of this kind, still an offensive action from some one point=
 of
the line is not impossible, and may not be unproductive of good results if =
the
enemy, as was the case in 1787, is not decidedly very superior. For althoug=
h
such an attack must be executed by means of dykes, and on that account cann=
ot
certainly have the advantage of much freedom of movement or of any great
impulsive force, nevertheless, it is impossible for the offensive side to
occupy all the dykes and roads which he does not require for his own purpos=
es,
and therefore the defensive with his better knowledge of the country, and b=
eing
in possession of the strong points, should be able by some of the unoccupie=
d
dykes to effect a real flank attack against the columns of the assailant, o=
r to
cut them off from their sources of supply. If now, on the other hand, we
reflect for a moment on the constrained position in which the assailant is
placed, how much more dependent he is on his communications than in almost =
any
other conceivable case, we may well imagine that every sally on the part of=
 the
defensive side which has the remotest possibility of success must at once a=
s a
demonstration be most effective. We doubt very much if the prudent and caut=
ious
duke of Brunswick would have ventured to approach Amsterdam if the Dutch ha=
d
only made such a demonstration, from Utrecht for instance.

<h3><a name=3D"chap86"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br>Defence of Forests</h3>

<p>
Above all things we must distinguish thick tangled and impassable forests f=
rom
extensive woods under a certain degree of culture, which are partly quite
clear, partly intersected by numerous roads.
</p>

<p>
Whenever the object is to form a defensive line, the latter should be left =
in
rear or avoided as much as possible. The defensive requires more than the
assailant to see clearly round him, partly because, as a rule, he is the
weaker, partly because the natural advantages of his position cause him to
develop his plans later than the assailant. If he should place a woody dist=
rict
before him he would be fighting like a blind man against one with his eyesi=
ght.
If he should place himself in the middle of the wood then both would be bli=
nd,
but that equality of condition is just what would not answer the natural
requirements of the defender.
</p>

<p>
Such a wooded country can therefore not be brought into any favourable
connection with the defensive except it is kept in rear of the defender=E2=
=80=99s
army, so as to conceal from the enemy all that takes place behind that army=
,
and at the same time to be available as an assistance to cover and facilita=
te
the retreat.
</p>

<p>
At present we only speak of forests in level country, for where the decided
mountain character enters into combination, its influence becomes predomina=
nt
over tactical and strategic measures, and we have already treated of those
subjects elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
But impassable forests, that is, such as can only be traversed on certain
roads, afford advantages in an indirect defence similar to those which the
defence derives from mountains for bringing on a battle under favourable
circumstances; the army can await the enemy behind the wood in a more or le=
ss
concentrated position with a view to falling on him the moment he debouches
from the road defiles. Such a forest resembles mountain in its effects more
than a river: for it affords, it is true, only one very long and difficult
defile, but it is in respect to the retreat rather advantageous than otherw=
ise.
</p>

<p>
But a direct defence of forests, let them be ever so impracticable, is a ve=
ry
hazardous piece of work for even the thinnest chain of outposts; for abatti=
s
are only imaginary barriers, and no wood is so completely impassable that i=
t
cannot be penetrated in a hundred places by small detachments, and these, i=
n
their relation to a chain of defensive posts, may be likened to the first d=
rops
of water which ooze through a roof and are soon followed by a general rush =
of
water.
</p>

<p>
Much more important is the influence of great forests of every kind in
connection with the arming of a nation; they are undoubtedly the true eleme=
nt
for such levies; if, therefore, the strategic plan of defence can be so
arranged that the enemy=E2=80=99s communications pass through great forests=
,
then, by that means, another mighty lever is brought into use in support of=
 the
work of defence.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap87"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br>The Cordon</h3>

<p>
The term cordon is used to denote every defensive plan which is intended
directly to cover a whole district of country by a line of posts in connect=
ion
with each other. We say <i>directly</i>, for several corps of a great army
posted in line with each other might protect a large district of country fr=
om
invasion without forming a cordon; but then this protection would not be
direct, but through the effect of combinations and movements.
</p>

<p>
It is evident at a glance that such a long defensive line as that must be,
which is to cover an extensive district of country directly, can only have =
a
very small degree of defensive stamina. Even when very large bodies of troo=
ps
occupy the lines this would be the case if they were attacked by correspond=
ing
masses. The object of a cordon can therefore only be to resist a weak blow,
whether that the weakness proceeds from a feeble will or the smallness of t=
he
force employed.
</p>

<p>
With this view the wall of China was built: a protection against the inroad=
s of
Tartars. This is the intention of all lines and frontier defences of the
European States bordering on Asia and Turkey. Applied in this way the cordo=
n
system is neither absurd nor does it appear unsuitable to its purpose.
Certainly it is not sufficient to stop all inroads, but it will make them m=
ore
difficult and therefore of less frequent occurrence, and this is a point of
considerable importance where relations subsist with people like those of A=
sia,
whose passions and habits have a perpetual tendency to war.
</p>

<p>
Next to this class of cordons come the lines, which, in the wars of modern
times have been formed between European States, such as the French lines on=
 the
Rhine and in the Netherlands. These were originally formed only with a view=
 to
protect a country against inroads made for the purpose of levying contribut=
ions
or living at the expense of the enemy. They are, therefore, only intended t=
o
check minor operations, and consequently it is also meant that they should =
be
defended by small bodies of troops. But, of course, in the event of the
enemy=E2=80=99s principal force taking its direction against these lines, t=
he
defender must also use his principal force in their defence, an event by no
means conducive to the best defensive arrangements. On account of this
disadvantage and because the protection against incursions in temporary war=
 is
quite a minor object, by which through the very existence of these lines an
excessive expenditure of troops may easily be caused, their formation is lo=
oked
upon in our day as a pernicious measure. The more power and energy thrown i=
nto
the prosecution of the war the more useless and dangerous this means become=
s.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, all very extended lines of outposts covering the quarters of an arm=
y
and intended to offer a certain amount of resistance come under the head of
cordons.
</p>

<p>
This defensive measure is chiefly designed as an impediment to raids, and o=
ther
such minor expeditions directed against single cantonments, and for this
purpose it may be quite sufficient if favoured by the country. Against an
advance of the main body of the enemy the opposition offered can be only
relative, that is, intended to gain time: but as this gain of time will be =
but
inconsiderable in most cases, this object may be regarded as a very minor
consideration in the establishment of these lines. The assembling and advan=
ce
of the enemy=E2=80=99s army itself can never take place so unobservedly tha=
t the
defender gets his first information of it through his outposts; when such i=
s
the case he is much to be pitied.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, in this case also, the cordon is only intended to resist the
attack of a weak force, and the object, therefore, in this and in the other=
 two
cases is not at variance with the means.
</p>

<p>
But that an army formed for the defence of a country should spread itself o=
ut
in a long line of defensive posts opposite to the enemy, that it should
disperse itself in a cordon form, seems to be so absurd that we must seek t=
o
discover the circumstances and motives which lead to and accompany such a
proceeding.
</p>

<p>
Every position in a mountainous country, even if taken up with the view of =
a
battle with the whole force united, is and must necessarily be more extende=
d
than a position in a level country. It <i>may be</i> because the aid of the
ground augments very much the force of the resistance; it <i>must be</i>
because a wider basis of retreat is required, as we have shown in the chapt=
er
on mountain defences. But if there is no near prospect of a battle, if it i=
s
probable that the enemy will remain in his position opposite to us for some
time without undertaking anything unless tempted by some very favourable
opportunity which may present itself (the usual state of things in most war=
s
formerly), then it is also natural not to limit ourselves merely to the
occupation of so much country as is absolutely necessary, but to hold as mu=
ch
right or left as is consistent with the security of the army, by which we
obtain many advantages, as we shall presently show. In open countries with
plenty of communications, this object may be effected to a greater extent t=
han
in mountains, through the principle of <i>movement</i>, and for that reason=
 the
extension and dispersion of the troops is less necessary in an open country=
; it
would also be much more dangerous there on account of the inferior capabili=
ty
of resistance of each part.
</p>

<p>
But in mountains where all occupation of ground is more dependent on local
defence, where relief cannot so soon be afforded to a point menaced, and wh=
ere,
when once the enemy has got possession of a point, it is more difficult to
dislodge him by a force slightly superior=E2=80=94in mountains, under these
circumstances, we shall always come to a form of position which, if not
strictly speaking a cordon, still approaches very near to it, being a line =
of
defensive posts. From such a disposition, consisting of several detached po=
sts,
to the cordon system, there is still certainly a considerable step, but it =
is
one which generals, nevertheless, often take without being aware of it, bei=
ng
drawn on from one step to another. First, the covering and the possession o=
f
the country is the object of the dispersion; afterwards it is the security =
of
the army itself. Every commander of a post calculates the advantage which m=
ay
be derived from this or that point connected with the approach to his posit=
ion
on the right or the left, and thus the whole progresses insensibly from one
degree of subdivision to another.
</p>

<p>
A cordon war, therefore, carried on by the principal force of an army, is n=
ot
to be considered a form of war designedly chosen with a view to stopping ev=
ery
blow which the enemy=E2=80=99s forces might attempt, but a situation which =
the
army is drawn into in the pursuit of a very different object, namely, the
holding and covering the country against an enemy who has no decisive
undertaking in view. Such a situation must always be looked upon as a mista=
ke;
and the motives through which generals have been lured by degrees into allo=
wing
one small post after another, are contemptible in connection with the objec=
t of
a large army; this point of view shows, at all events, the possibility of s=
uch
a mistake. That it is really an error, namely, a mistaken appreciation of o=
ur
own position, and that of the enemy is sometimes not observed, and it is sp=
oken
of as an erroneous <i>system</i>. But this same system, when it is pursued =
with
advantage, or, at all events, without causing damage, is quietly approved.
Every one praises the <i>faultless</i> campaigns of Prince Henry in the Sev=
en
Years=E2=80=99 War, because they have been pronounced so by the king, altho=
ugh
these campaigns exhibit the most decided and most incomprehensible examples=
 of
chains of posts so extended that they may just with as much propriety be ca=
lled
cordons as any that ever were. We may completely justify these positions by
saying, the prince knew his opponent; he knew that he had no enterprises of=
 a
decisive character to apprehend from that quarter, and as the object of his
position besides was to occupy always as much territory as possible, he
therefore carried out that object as far as circumstances in any way permit=
ted.
If the prince had once been unfortunate with one of these cobwebs, and had =
met
with a severe loss, we should not say that he had pursued a faulty system o=
f
warfare, but that he had been mistaken about a measure and had applied it t=
o a
case to which it was not suited.
</p>

<p>
While we thus seek to explain how the cordon system, as it is called, may b=
e
resorted to by the principal force in a theatre in war, and how it may even=
 be
a judicious and useful measure, and, therefore, far from being an absurdity=
, we
must, at the same time, acknowledge that there appear to have been instance=
s
where generals or their staff have overlooked the real meaning or object of=
 a
cordon system, and assumed its relative value to be a general one; conceivi=
ng
it to be really suited to afford protection against every kind of attack,
instances, therefore, where there was no mistaken application of the measur=
e
but a complete misunderstanding of its nature; we shall further allow that =
this
very absurdity amongst others seems to have taken place in the defence of t=
he
Vosges by the Austrian and Prussian armies in 1793 and 1794.

<h3><a name=3D"chap88"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br>Key to the Country</h3>

<p>
There is no theoretical idea in the art of war which has played such a part=
 in
criticism as that we are now entering upon. It is the =E2=80=9Cgreat war
steed=E2=80=9D in all accounts of battles and campaigns; the most frequent =
point
of view in all arguments, and one of those fragments of scientific form wit=
h
which critics make a show of learning. And yet the conception embodied in i=
t
has never yet been established, nor has it ever been clearly explained.
</p>

<p>
We shall try to ascertain its real meaning, and then see how far it can be =
made
available for practical use.
</p>

<p>
We treat of it here because the defence of mountains, river defences, as we=
ll
as the conceptions of strong and entrenched camps with which it closely
connects itself, required to have precedence.
</p>

<p>
The indefinite confused conception which is concealed behind this ancient
military metaphor has sometimes signified the most exposed part of a countr=
y at
other times the strongest.
</p>

<p>
If there is any spot without the <i>possession of which no one dare venture=
 to
penetrate into an enemy=E2=80=99s country</i> that may, with propriety, be =
called
the key of that country. But this simple, though certainly at the same time
also, barren notion has not satisfied theorists, and they have amplified it=
,
and under the term key of a country imagined <i>points</i> which <i>decide =
upon
the possession of the whole country.</i>
</p>

<p>
When the Russians wanted to advance into the Crimean peninsula, they were
obliged to make themselves masters of the isthmus of Perekop and its lines,=
 not
so much to gain an entrance generally=E2=80=94for Lascy turned it twice (17=
37 and
1738)=E2=80=94but to be able to establish themselves with tolerable securit=
y in
the Crimea. That is very simple, but we gain very little in this through th=
e
conception of a key-point. But if it might be said, Whoever has possession =
of
the district of Langres commands all France as far as Paris=E2=80=94that is=
 to
say, it only rests with himself to take possession=E2=80=94that is plainly =
a very
different thing, something of much higher importance. According to the firs=
t
kind of conception the possession of the country cannot be thought of witho=
ut
the possession of the point which we have called key; that is a thing which=
 is
intelligible to the most ordinary capacity: but according to the second kin=
d of
conception, the possession of the point which we have called key, cannot be
imagined without the possession of the country following as a necessary
consequence; that is plainly, something marvellous, common sense is no long=
er
sufficient to grasp this, the magic of the occult sciences must be called i=
nto
requisition. This cabala came into existence in works published fifty years
ago, and reached its zenith at the end of the last century; and notwithstan=
ding
the irresistible force, certainty and distinctness with which
Buonaparte=E2=80=99s method of conducting war carried conviction generally,=
 this
cabala has, nevertheless, still managed, we say, to spin out the thread of =
its
tenacious existence through the medium of books.
</p>

<p>
(Setting aside for a moment <i>our</i> conception of the key-point) it is
self-evident that in every country there are points of <i>commanding</i>
importance, where several roads meet, where our means of subsistence may be
conveniently collected, which have the advantage of being centrally situate=
d
with reference to other important points, the possession of which in short
meets many requirements and affords many advantages. Now, if generals wishi=
ng
to express the importance of such a point by one word have called it the <i=
>key
of the land</i>, it would be pedantic affectation to take offence at their
using that term; on the contrary we should rather say the term is very
expressive and pleasing. But if we try to convert this mere flower of speec=
h
into the germ of a system branching out like a tree into many ramifications=
,
common sense rises in opposition, and demands that the expression should be
restricted to its true value.
</p>

<p>
In order to develop a system out of the expression, it was necessary to res=
ort
to something more distinct and absolute than the practical, but certainly v=
ery
indefinite, meaning attaching to the term in the narrations of generals whe=
n
speaking of their military enterprises. And from amongst all its various
relations, that of high ground was chosen.
</p>

<p>
Where a road traverses a mountain ridge, we thank heaven when we get to the=
 top
and have only to descend. This feeling so natural to a single traveller is
still more so in the case of an army All difficulties seem to be overcome, =
and
so they are indeed in most instances; we find that the descent is easy, and=
 we
are conscious of a kind of feeling of superiority over any one who would st=
op
us; we have an extensive view over the country, and command it with a look
beforehand. Thus the highest point on a road over a mountain is always
considered to possess a decisive importance, and it does in fact in the
majority of cases, but by no means in all. Such points are very often descr=
ibed
in the despatches of generals by the name of key-points; but certainly agai=
n in
a somewhat different and generally in a more restricted sense. This idea ha=
s
been the starting point of a false theory (of which, perhaps, Lloyd may be
regarded as the founder); and on this account, elevated points from which
several roads descend into the adjacent country, came to be regarded as the
keypoints of the country=E2=80=94as points which <i>command</i> the country=
. It
was natural that this view should amalgamate itself with one very nearly
connected with it, that of a <i>systematic defence of mountains</i>, and th=
at
the matter should thus be driven still further into the regions of the
illusory; added to which many tactical elements connected with the defence =
of
mountains came into play, and thus the idea of the highest <i>point in the
road</i> was soon abandoned, and the highest point generally of the whole
mountain system, that is the point of the <i>watershed</i>, was substituted=
 for
it as the key of the country.
</p>

<p>
Now just at that time, that is the latter half of the preceding century, mo=
re
definite ideas on the forms given to the surface of the earth through aqueo=
us
action became current; thus natural science lent a hand to the theory of wa=
r by
this geological system, and then every barrier of practical truth was broke=
n
through, and reasoning floated in the illusory system of a geological analo=
gy.
In consequence of this, about the end of the eighteenth century we heard, o=
r
rather we <i>read</i>, of nothing but the sources of the Rhine and Danube. =
It
is true that this nuisance prevailed mostly in books, for only a small port=
ion
of book wisdom ever reaches the real world, and the more foolish a theory t=
he
less it will attain to practice; but this of which we are now speaking has =
not
been unproductive of injury to Germany by its practical effects, therefore =
we
are not fighting with a windmill, in proof of which we shall quote two
examples; first, the important but very scientific campaigns of the Prussia=
n
army, 1793 and 1794 in the Vosges, the theoretical key to which will be fou=
nd
in the works of Gravert and Massenbach; secondly, the campaign of 1814, whe=
n,
on the principle of the same theory, an army of 200,000 men was led by the =
nose
through Switzerland on to the plateau of Langres as it is called.
</p>

<p>
But a high point in a country from which all its waters flow, is generally
nothing more than a high point; and all that in exaggeration and false
application of ideas, true in themselves, was written at the end of the
eighteenth and commencement of the nineteenth centuries, about its influenc=
e on
military events, is completely imaginary. If the Rhine and Danube and all t=
he
six rivers of Germany had their common source on the top of one mountain, t=
hat
mountain would not on that account have any claim to any greater military v=
alue
than being suited for the position of a trigonometrical point. For a signal
tower it would be less useful, still less so for a vidette, and for a whole
army worth just nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
To seek for a <i>key-position</i> therefore in the so called <i>key
country</i>, that is where the different branches of the mountains diverge =
from
a common point, and at the highest source of its waters, is merely an idea =
in
books, which is overthrown by nature itself, because nature does not make t=
he
ridges and valleys so easy to descend as is assumed by the hitherto so call=
ed
theory of ground, but distributes peaks and gorges, in the most irregular
manner, and not unfrequently the lowest water level is surrounded by the
loftiest masses of mountain. If any one questions military history on the
subject, he will soon convince himself that the leading geological points o=
f a
country exercise very little regular influence on the use of the country fo=
r
the purposes of war, and that little is so over-balanced by other local
circumstances, and other requirements, that a line of positions may often r=
un
quite close to one of the points we are discussing without having been in a=
ny
way attracted there by that point.
</p>

<p>
We have only dwelt so long upon this false idea because a whole=E2=80=94and=
 very
pretentious=E2=80=94system has built itself upon it. We now leave it, and t=
urn
back to our own views.
</p>

<p>
We say, then, that if the expression, <i>key-position</i>, is to represent =
an
independent conception in strategy, it must only be that of a locality the
possession of which is indispensable before daring to enter the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
country. But if we choose to designate by that term every convenient point =
of
entrance to a country, or every advantageous central point in the country, =
then
the term loses its real meaning (that is, its value), and denotes something
which may be found anywhere more or less. It then becomes a mere pleasing
figure of speech.
</p>

<p>
But positions such as the term conveys to our mind are very rarely indeed t=
o be
found. In general, the best key to the country lies in the enemy=E2=80=99s =
army;
and when the idea of country predominates over that of the armed force, som=
e
very specially advantageous circumstances must prevail. These, according to=
 our
opinion, may be recognised by their tending to two principal results: first=
,
that the force occupying the position, through the help of the ground, obta=
ins
extraordinary capability of tactical resistance; second, that the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
lines of communication can be sooner effectively threatened from this posit=
ion
than he can threaten ours.

<h3><a name=3D"chap89"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br>Operating Against a Flank</h3>

<p>
We need hardly observe that we speak of the strategic flank, that is, a sid=
e of
the theatre of war, and that the attack from one side in battle, or the
tactical movement against a flank, must not be confounded with it; and even=
 in
cases in which the strategic operation against a flank, in its last stage, =
ends
in the tactical operation, they can quite easily be kept separate, because =
the
one never follows necessarily out of the other.
</p>

<p>
These flanking movements, and the flanking positions connected with them,
belong also to the mere useless pageantry of theory, which is seldom met wi=
th
in actual war. Not that the means itself is either ineffectual or illusory,=
 but
because both sides generally seek to guard themselves against its effects; =
and
cases in which this is impossible are rare. Now in these uncommon cases thi=
s
means has often also proved highly efficacious, and for this reason, as wel=
l as
on account of the constant watching against it which is required in war, it=
 is
important that it should be clearly explained in theory. Although the strat=
egic
operation against a flank can naturally be imagined, not only on the part o=
f
the defensive, but also on that of the offensive, still it has much more
affinity with the first, and therefore finds its place under the head of
defensive means.
</p>

<p>
Before we enter into the subject, we must establish the simple principle, w=
hich
must never be lost sight of afterwards in the consideration of the subject,
that troops which are to act against the rear or flank of the enemy cannot =
be
employed against his front, and that, therefore, whether it be in tactics o=
r
strategy, it is a completely false kind of notion to consider that <i>comin=
g on
the rear</i> of the enemy is at once an advantage in itself. In itself, it =
is
as yet nothing; but it will become something in connection with other thing=
s,
and something either advantageous or the reverse, according to the nature o=
f
these things, the examination of which now claims our attention.
</p>

<p>
First, in the action against the strategic flank, we must make a distinctio=
n
between two objects of that measure=E2=80=94between the action merely again=
st the
<i>communications</i>, and that against the <i>line of retreat</i>, with wh=
ich,
at the same time, an effect upon the communications may also be combined.
</p>

<p>
When Daun, in 1758, sent a detachment to seize the convoys on their way to =
the
siege of Olm=C3=BCtz, he had plainly no intention of impeding the king=E2=
=80=99s
retreat into Silesia; he rather wished to bring about that retreat, and wou=
ld
willingly have opened the line to him.
</p>

<p>
In the campaign of 1812, the object of all the expeditionary corps that wer=
e
detached from the Russian army in the months of September and October, was =
only
to intercept the communications, not to stop the retreat; but the latter wa=
s
quite plainly the design of the Moldavian army which, under Tschitschagof,
marched against the Beresina, as well as of the attack which General
Wittgenstein was commissioned to make on the French corps stationed on the
Dwina.
</p>

<p>
These examples are merely to make the exposition clearer.
</p>

<p>
The action against the lines of communication is directed against the
enemy=E2=80=99s convoys, against small detachments following in rear of the=
 army,
against couriers and travellers, small dep=C3=B4ts, etc.; in fact, against =
all the
means which the enemy requires to keep his army in a vigorous and healthy
condition; its object is, therefore, to weaken the condition of the enemy i=
n
this respect, and by this means to cause him to retreat.
</p>

<p>
The action against the enemy=E2=80=99s line of retreat is to cut his army o=
ff
from that line. It cannot effect this object unless the enemy really determ=
ines
to retreat; but it may certainly cause him to do so by threatening his line=
 of
retreat, and, therefore, it may have the same effect as the action against =
the
line of communication, by working as a demonstration. But as already said, =
none
of these effects are to be expected from the mere turning which has been
effected, from the mere geometrical form given to the disposition of the
troops, they only result from the conditions suitable to the same.
</p>

<p>
In order to learn more distinctly these conditions, we shall separate
completely the two actions against the flank, and first consider that which=
 is
directed against the communications.
</p>

<p>
Here we must first establish two principal conditions, one or other of whic=
h
must always be forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
The first is, that the forces used for this action against the flank of the
enemy must be so insignificant in numbers that their absence is not observe=
d in
front.
</p>

<p>
The second, that the enemy=E2=80=99s army has run its career, and therefore=
 can
neither make use of a fresh victory over our army, nor can he pursue us if =
we
evade a combat by moving out of the way.
</p>

<p>
This last case, which is by no means so uncommon as might be supposed, we s=
hall
lay aside for the moment, and occupy ourselves with the accessory condition=
s of
the first.
</p>

<p>
The first of these is, that the communications have a certain length, and
cannot be protected by a few good posts; the second point is, that the
situation of the line is such as exposes it to our action.
</p>

<p>
This weakness of the line may arise in two ways=E2=80=94either by its direc=
tion,
if it is not perpendicular to the strategic front of the enemy=E2=80=99s ar=
my, or
because his lines of communication pass through our territory; if both thes=
e
circumstances exist, the line is so much the more exposed. These two relati=
ons
require a closer examination.
</p>

<p>
One would think that when it is a question of covering a line of communicat=
ion
forty or fifty miles long, it is of little consequence whether the position
occupied by an army standing at one extremity of this line forms an oblique
angle or a right angle in reference to it, as the breadth of the position i=
s
little more than a mere point in comparison to the line; and yet it is not =
so
unimportant as it may seem. When an army is posted at a right angle with it=
s
communications, it is difficult, even with a considerable superiority, to
interrupt the communications by any detachments or partisans sent out for t=
he
purpose. If we think only of the difficulty of covering absolutely a certai=
n
space, we should not believe this, but rather suppose, on the contrary, tha=
t it
must be very difficult for an army to protect its rear (that is, the countr=
y
behind it) against all expeditions which an enemy superior in numbers may
undertake. Certainly, if we could look at everything in war as it is on a s=
heet
of paper! Then the party covering the line, in his uncertainty as to the po=
int
where light troops or partisans may appear, would be in a certain measure
blind, and only the partisans would see. But if we think of the uncertainty=
 and
insufficiency of intelligence gained in war, and know that both parties are
incessantly groping in the dark, then we easily perceive that a detached co=
rps
sent round the enemy=E2=80=99s flank to gain his rear is in the position of=
 a man
engaged in a fray with numbers in a dark room. In the end he must fall; and=
 so
must it also be with bands who get round an army occupying a perpendicular
position, and who therefore place themselves near to the enemy, but widely
separated from their own people. Not only is there danger of losing numbers=
 in
this way; there is also a risk of the whole instrument itself being blunted
immediately; for the very first misfortune which happens to one such party =
will
make all the others timid, and instead of bold attacks and insolent dodging=
,
the only play will be constant running away.
</p>

<p>
Through this difficulty, therefore, an army occupying a perpendicular posit=
ion
covers the nearest points on its line of communications for a distance of t=
wo
or three marches, according to the strength of the army; but those nearest
points are just those which are most in danger, as they are the nearest to =
the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in the case of a decidedly oblique position, no such par=
t of
the line of communication is covered; the smallest pressure, the most
insignificant attempt on the part of the enemy, leads at once to a vulnerab=
le
point.
</p>

<p>
But now, what is it which determines the front of a position, if it is not =
just
the direction perpendicular to the line of communication? The front of the
enemy; but then, again, this may be equally as well supposed as dependent o=
n
our front. Here there is a reciprocal effect, for the origin of which we mu=
st
search.
</p>

nication.jpg" style=3D"width:100%;" alt=3D"lines of communication "><br><br=
>
</div>

<p>
If we suppose the lines of communication of the assailant, <i>a b</i>, so
situated with respect to those of the enemy, <i>c d</i>, that the two lines
form a considerable angle with each other, it is evident that if the defens=
ive
wishes to take up a position at <i>e</i>, where the two lines intersect, th=
e
assailant from <i>b</i>, by the mere geometrical relation, could compel him=
 to
form front opposite to him, and thus to lay bare his communications. The ca=
se
would be reversed if the defensive took up his position on this side of the
point of junction, about <i>d</i>; then the assailant must make front towar=
ds
him, if so be that his line of operations, which closely depends on
geographical conditions, cannot be arbitrarily changed, and moved, for
instance, to the direction <i>a d</i>. From this it would seem to follow th=
at
the defender has an advantage in this system of reciprocal action, because =
he
only requires to take a position on this side of the intersection of the tw=
o
lines. But very far from attaching any importance to this geometrical eleme=
nt,
we only brought it into consideration to make ourselves the better understo=
od;
and we are rather of opinion that local and generally individual relations =
have
much more to do with determining the position of the defender; that, theref=
ore,
it is quite impossible to lay down in general which of two belligerents wil=
l be
obliged soonest to expose his communications.
</p>

<p>
If the lines of communication of both sides lie in one and the same directi=
on,
then whichever of the two parties takes up an oblique position will certain=
ly
compel his adversary to do the same. But then there is nothing gained
geometrically by this, and both parties attain the same advantages and
disadvantages.
</p>

<p>
In the continuation of our considerations we shall, therefore, confine
ourselves to the case of the line of communication of one side only being
exposed.
</p>

<p>
Now as regards the second disadvantageous relation of a line of communicati=
on,
that is to say, when it runs through an enemy=E2=80=99s country, it is clea=
r in
itself how much the line is compromised by that circumstance, if the
inhabitants of the country have taken up arms; and consequently the case mu=
st
be looked at as if a body of the enemy was posted all along the line; this
body, it is true, is in itself weak without solidity or intensive force; bu=
t we
must also take into consideration what the close contact and influence of s=
uch
a hostile force may nevertheless effect through the number of points which
offer themselves one after another on long lines of communication. That
requires no further explanation. But even if the enemy=E2=80=99s subjects h=
ave
not taken up arms, and even if there is no militia in the country, or other
military organisation, indeed if the people are even very unwarlike in spir=
it,
still the mere relation of the people as subjects to a hostile government i=
s a
disadvantage for the lines of communication of the other side which is alwa=
ys
felt. The assistance which expeditionary forces and partisans derive merely
through a better understanding with the people, through a knowledge of the
country and its inhabitants, through good information, through the support =
of
official functionaries, is, for them, of decided value; and this support ev=
ery
such body will enjoy without any special effort on its own part. Added to t=
his,
within a certain distance there will not be wanting fortresses, rivers,
mountains, or other places of refuge, which of ordinary right belong to the
enemy, if they have not been formally taken possession of and occupied by o=
ur
troops.
</p>

<p>
Now in such a case as is here supposed, especially if attended with other
favourable circumstances, it is possible to act against the communications =
of
an army, although their direction is perpendicular to the position of that
army; for the detachments employed for the purpose do not then require to f=
all
back always on their own army, because being in their own country they are =
safe
enough if they only make their escape.
</p>

<p>
We have, therefore, now ascertained that=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. A considerable length,
</p>

<p>
2. An oblique direction,
</p>

<p>
3. An enemy=E2=80=99s province,
</p>

<p>
are the principal circumstances under which the lines of communication of a=
n
army may be interrupted by a relatively small proportion of armed forces on=
 the
side of the enemy; in order to make this interruption effectual, a fourth
condition is still requisite, which is a certain duration of time. Respecti=
ng
this point, we beg attention to what has been said in the fifteenth chapter=
 of
the fifth book.
</p>

<p>
But these four conditions are only the chief points which relate to the
subject; a number of local and special circumstances attach themselves to
these, and often attain to an influence more decisive and important than th=
at
of the principal ones themselves. Selecting only the most essential, we men=
tion
the state of the roads, the nature of the country through which they pass, =
the
means of cover which are afforded by rivers, mountains, and morasses, the
seasons and weather, the importance of particular convoys, such as siege
trains, the number of light troops, etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
On all these circumstances, therefore, will depend the effect with which a
general can act on his opponent=E2=80=99s communications; and by comparing =
the
result of the whole of these circumstances on the one side with the result =
of
the whole on the other, we obtain a just estimate of the relative advantage=
s of
both systems of communication, on which will depend which of the two genera=
ls
can play the highest game.
</p>

<p>
What here seems so prolix in the explanation is often decided in the concre=
te
case at first sight; but still, the tact of a practised judgment is require=
d
for that, and person must have thought over every one of the cases now
developed in order to see in its true light the absurdity of those critical
writers who think they have settled something by the mere words
=E2=80=9Cturning=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cacting on a flank,=E2=80=9D without =
giving their
reasons.
</p>

<p>
We now come to the <i>second chief condition</i>, under which the strategic
action against the enemy=E2=80=99s flank may take place.
</p>

<p>
If the enemy is hindered from advancing by any other cause but the resistan=
ce
which our army opposes, let that cause be what it may, then our army has no
reason to be apprehensive about weakening itself by sending out detachments=
 to
harass the enemy; for if the enemy should attempt to chastise us by an atta=
ck,
we have only to yield some ground and decline the combat. This is what was =
done
by the chief Russian army at Moscow in 1812. But it is not at all necessary
that everything should be again on the same great scale as in that campaign=
 for
such a case to happen again. In the first Silesian war, Frederick the Great=
 was
each time in this situation, on the frontiers of Bohemia and Moravia, and i=
n
the complex affairs relating to generals and their armies, many causes of
different kinds, particularly political ones, may be imagined, which make
further advance an impossibility.
</p>

<p>
As in the case now supposed more forces may be spared to act against the
enemy=E2=80=99s flank, the other conditions need not be quite so favourable=
: even
the nature of our communications in relation to those of the enemy need not
give us the advantage in that respect, as an enemy who is not in a conditio=
n to
make any particular use of our further retreat is not likely to use his rig=
ht
to retaliate, but will rather be anxious about the direct covering of his o=
wn
line of retreat.
</p>

<p>
Such a situation is therefore very well suited to obtain for us, by means l=
ess
brilliant and complete but less dangerous than a victory, those results whi=
ch
it would be too great a risk to seek to obtain by a battle.
</p>

<p>
As in such a case we feel little anxiety about exposing our own line of
communications, by taking up a position on one or other flank, and as the e=
nemy
by that means may always be comspelled to form front obliquely to his line =
of
communications, therefore <i>this one</i> of the conditions above named wil=
l
seldom fail to occur. The more the rest of the conditions, as well as other
circumstances, co-operate, so much the more certain are we of success from =
the
means now in question; but the fewer favourable circumstances exist, the mo=
re
will all depend on superior skill in combination, and promptitude and preci=
sion
in the execution.
</p>

<p>
Here is the proper field for strategic man=C5=93uvres, such as are to be fo=
und so
frequently in the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, in Silesia and Saxony, and in t=
he
campaigns of 1760 and 1762. If, in many wars in which only a moderate amoun=
t of
elementary force is displayed, such strategic man=C5=93uvring very often ap=
pears,
this is not because the commander on each occasion found himself at the end=
 of
his career, but because want of resolution and courage, and of an enterpris=
ing
spirit, and dread of responsibility, have often supplied the place of real
impediments; for a case in point, we have only to call to mind Field Marsha=
l
Daun.
</p>

<p>
As a summary of the results of our considerations, we may say, that the act=
ion
against a flank is most effectual=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. In the defensive;
</p>

<p>
2. Towards the end of a campaign;
</p>

<p>
3. Above all, in a retreat into the heart of the country; and
</p>

<p>
4. In connection with a general arming of the people.
</p>

<p>
On the mode of executing this action against the communications, we have on=
ly a
few words to say.
</p>

<p>
The enterprises must be conducted by skilful detachment leaders, who, at th=
e
head of small bodies, by bold marches and attacks, fall upon the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
weak garrisons, convoys, and small detachments on the march here and there,
encourage the national levies (<i>landsturm</i>), and sometimes join with t=
hem
in particular undertakings. These parties must be more numerous than strong
individually, and so organised that it may be possible to unite several of =
them
for any greater undertaking without any obstacle from the vanity or caprice=
 of
any of the single leaders.
</p>

<p>
We have now to speak of the action against the enemy=E2=80=99s line of retr=
eat.
</p>

<p>
Here we must keep in view, above all things, the principle with which we
commenced, that forces destined to operate in rear cannot be used in front;
that, therefore, the action against the rear or flanks is not an increase o=
f
force in itself; it is only to be regarded as a more powerful application (=
or
employment) of the same; increasing the degree of success in prospect, but =
also
increasing the degree of risk.
</p>

<p>
Every opposition offered with the sword which is not of a direct and simple
nature, has a tendency to raise the result at the cost of its certainty. An
operation against the enemy=E2=80=99s flank, whether with one compact force=
, or
with separate bodies converging from several quarters, belongs to this
category.
</p>

<p>
But now, if cutting off the enemy=E2=80=99s retreat is not to be a mere
demonstration, but is seriously intended, the real solution is a decisive
battle, or, at least, the conjunction of all the conditions for the same; a=
nd
just in this solution we find again the two elements above-mentioned=E2=80=
=94the
greater result and the greater danger. Therefore, if a general is to stand
justified in adopting this method of action, his reasons must be favourable
conditions.
</p>

<p>
In this method of resistance we must distinguish the two forms already
mentioned. The first is, if a general with his whole force intends to attac=
k
the enemy in rear, either from a position taken up on the flank for that
purpose, or by a formal turning movement; the second is, if he divides his
forces, and, by an enveloping position with one part, threatens the
enemy=E2=80=99s rear, with the other part his front.
</p>

<p>
The result is intensified in both cases alike, that is=E2=80=94either there=
 is a
real interception of the retreat, and consequently the enemy=E2=80=99s army=
 taken
prisoners, or the greater part scattered, or there may be a long and hasty
retreat of the enemy=E2=80=99s force to escape the danger.
</p>

<p>
But the intensified risk is different in the two cases.
</p>

<p>
If we turn the enemy with our whole force, the danger lies in the laying op=
en
our own rear; and hence the question again depends on the relation of the
mutual lines of retreat, just as in the action against the lines of
communication, it depended on the relation of those lines.
</p>

<p>
Now certainly the defender, if he is in his own country, is less restricted
than the assailant, both as to his lines of retreat and communication, and =
in
so far is therefore in a better position to turn his adversary strategicall=
y;
but this general relation is not of a sufficiently decisive character to be
used as the foundation of a practical method; therefore, nothing but the wh=
ole
of the relations in each individual case can decide.
</p>

<p>
Only so much we may add, that favourable conditions are naturally more comm=
on
in wide spheres of action than in small; more common, also, on the side of
independent states than on that of weak ones, dependent on foreign aid, and
whose armies must, therefore, constantly have their attention bent on the p=
oint
of junction with the auxiliary army; lastly, they become most favorable for=
 the
defender towards the close of the campaign, when the impulsive force of the
assailant is somewhat spent; very much, again, in the same manner as in the
case of the lines of communication.
</p>

<p>
Such a flank position as the Russians took up with such advantage on the ro=
ad
from Moscow to Kaluga, when Buonaparte=E2=80=99s aggressive force was spent=
,
would have brought them into a scrape at the commencement of the campaign a=
t
the camp of Drissa, if they had not been wise enough to change their plan i=
n
good time.
</p>

<p>
The other method of turning the enemy, and cutting off his retreat by divid=
ing
our force, entails the risk attending a division of our own force, whilst t=
he
enemy, having the advantage of interior lines, retains his forces united, a=
nd
therefore has the power of acting with superior numbers against one of our
divisions. This is a disadvantage which nothing can remove, and in exposing
ourselves to it, we can only be justified by one of three principal
reasons:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. The original division of the force which makes such a method of action
necessary, unless we incur a great loss of time.
</p>

<p>
2. A great moral and physical superiority, which justifies the adoption of =
a
decisive method.
</p>

<p>
3. The want of impulsive force in the enemy as soon as he has arrived at th=
e
culminating point of his career.
</p>

<p>
When Frederick the Great invaded Bohemia, 1757, on converging lines, he had=
 not
in view to combine an attack in front with one on the strategic rear, at al=
l
events, this was by no means his principal object, as we shall more fully
explain elsewhere, but in any case it is evident that there never could hav=
e
been any question of a concentration of forces in Silesia or Saxony before =
the
invasion, as he would thereby have sacrificed all the advantages of a surpr=
ise.
</p>

<p>
When the allies formed their plan for the second part of the campaign of 18=
13,
looking to their great superiority in numbers, they might very well at that
time entertain the idea of attacking Buonaparte=E2=80=99s right on the Elbe=
 with
their main force, and of thus shifting the theatre of war from the Oder to =
the
Elbe. Their ill-success at Dresden is to be ascribed not to this general pl=
an
but to their faulty dispositions both strategic and tactical. They could ha=
ve
concentrated 220,000 men at Dresden against Buonaparte=E2=80=99s 130,000, a
proportion of numbers eminently favourable (at Leipsic, at least, the
proportion was as 285 : 157). It is true that Buonaparte had distributed hi=
s
forces too evenly for the particular system of a defence upon one line (in
Silesia 70,000 against 90,000, in the Mark=E2=80=94Brandenburg=E2=80=9470,0=
00
against 110,000), but at all events it would have been difficult for him,
without completely abandoning Silesia, to assemble on the Elbe a force whic=
h
could have contended with the principal army of the allies in a decisive
battle. The allies could also have easily called up the army of Wrede to th=
e
Maine, and employed it to try to cut Buonaparte off from the road to Mayenc=
e.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, in 1812, the Russians might have directed their army of Moldavia up=
on
Volhynia and Lithuania in order to move it forward afterwards against the r=
ear
of the principal French army, because it was quite certain that Moscow must=
 be
the extreme point of the French line of operations. For any part of Russia
beyond Moscow there was nothing to fear in that campaign, therefore the Rus=
sian
main army had no cause to consider itself too weak.
</p>

<p>
This same scheme formed part of the disposition of the forces laid down in =
the
first defensive plan proposed by General Phul, according to which the army =
of
Barclay was to occupy the camp at Drissa, whilst that under Bragathion was =
to
press forward against the rear of the main French army. But what a differen=
ce
of circumstances in the two cases! In the first of them the French were thr=
ee
times as strong as the Russians; in the second, the Russians were decidedly
superior. In the first, Buonaparte=E2=80=99s great army had in it an impuls=
ive
force which carried it to Moscow 80 miles beyond Drissa: in the second, it =
is
unfit to make a day=E2=80=99s march beyond Moscow; in the first, the line o=
f
retreat on the Niemen did not exceed 30 miles: in the second it was 112. Th=
e
same action against the enemy=E2=80=99s retreat therefore, which was so
successful in the second case, would, in the first, have been the wildest
folly.
</p>

<p>
As the action against the enemy=E2=80=99s line of retreat, if it is more th=
an a
demonstration, becomes a formal attack from the rear, there remains therefo=
re
still a good deal to be said on the subject, but it will come in more
appropriately in the book upon the attack; we shall therefore break off her=
e
and content ourselves with having given the conditions under which this kin=
d of
reaction may take place.
</p>

<p>
Very commonly the design of causing the enemy to retreat by menacing his li=
ne
of retreat, is understood to imply rather a mere demonstration than the act=
ual
execution of the threat. If it was necessary that every efficacious
demonstration should be founded on the actual practicability of real action=
,
which seems a matter of course at first sight, then it would accord with th=
e
same in all respects. But this is not the case: on the contrary, in the cha=
pter
on demonstrations we shall see that they are connected with conditions some=
what
different, at all events in some respects, we therefore refer our readers t=
o
that chapter.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap90"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br>Retreat into the Interior of the=
 Country</h3>

<p>
We have considered the voluntary retreat into the heart of the country as a
particular indirect form of defence through which it is expected the enemy =
will
be destroyed, not so much by the sword as by exhaustion from his own effort=
s.
In this case, therefore, a great battle is either not supposed, or it is
assumed to take place when the enemy=E2=80=99s forces are considerably redu=
ced.
</p>

<p>
Every assailant in advancing diminishes his military strength by the advanc=
e;
we shall consider this more in detail in the seventh book; here we must ass=
ume
that result which we may the more readily do as it is clearly shown by mili=
tary
history in every campaign in which there has been a considerable advance.
</p>

<p>
This loss in the advance is increased if the enemy has not been beaten, but
withdraws of his own accord with his forces intact, and offering a steady
continuous resistance, sells every step of ground at a bloody price, so tha=
t
the advance is a continuous combat for ground and not a mere pursuit.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the losses which a party on the defensive suffers on a
retreat, are much greater if his retreat has been preceded by a defeat in
battle than if his retreat is voluntary. For if he is able to offer the pur=
suer
the daily resistance which we expect on a voluntary retreat, his losses wou=
ld
be <i>at least</i> the same in that way, over and above which those sustain=
ed
in the battle have still to be added. But how contrary to the nature of the
thing such a supposition as this would be! The best army in the world if
obliged to retire far into the country after the loss of a battle, will suf=
fer
losses on the retreat, <i>beyond measure out of proportion;</i> and if the
enemy is considerably superior, as we suppose him, in the case of which we =
are
now speaking, if he pursues with great energy as has almost always been don=
e in
modern wars, then there is the highest probability that a regular flight ta=
kes
place by which the army is usually completely ruined.
</p>

<p>
A <i>regularly measured</i> daily resistance, that is, one which each time =
only
lasts as long as the balance of success in the combat can be kept wavering,=
 and
in which we secure ourselves from defeat by giving up the ground which has =
been
contested at the right moment, will cost the assailant at least as many men=
 as
the defender in these combats, for the loss which the latter by retiring no=
w
and again must unavoidably suffer in prisoners, will be balanced by the los=
ses
of the other under fire, as the assailant must always fight against the
advantages of the ground. It is true that the retreating side loses entirel=
y
all those men who are badly wounded, but the assailant likewise loses all h=
is
in the same case for the present, as they usually remain several months in =
the
hospitals.
</p>

<p>
The result will be that the two armies will wear each other away in nearly
equal proportions in these perpetual collisions.
</p>

<p>
It is quite different in the pursuit of a beaten army. Here the troops lost=
 in
battle, the general disorganisation, the broken courage, the anxiety about =
the
retreat, make such a resistance on the part of the retreating army very
difficult, in many cases impossible; and the pursuer who, in the former cas=
e,
advances extremely cautiously, even hesitatingly, like a blind man, always
groping about, presses forward in the latter case with the firm tread of th=
e
conqueror, with the overweening spirit which good fortune imparts, with the
confidence of a demigod, and the more daringly he urges the pursuit so much=
 the
more he hastens on things in the direction which they have already taken,
because here is the true field for the moral forces which intensify and
multiply themselves without being restricted to the rigid numbers and measu=
res
of the physical world.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore very plain how different will be the relations of two armie=
s
according as it is by the first or the second of the above ways, that they
arrive at that point which may be regarded as the end of the assailant=E2=
=80=99s
course.
</p>

<p>
This is merely the result of the mutual destruction; to this must now be ad=
ded
the reductions which the advancing party suffers otherwise in addition, and
respecting which, as already said, we refer to the seventh book; further, o=
n
the other hand, we have to take into account reinforcements which the
retreating party receives in the great majority of cases, by forces
subsequently joining him either in the form of help from abroad or through
persistent efforts at home.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, there is, in the means of subsistence, such a disproportion between=
 the
retreating side and the advancing, that the first not uncommonly lives in
superfluity when the other is reduced to want.
</p>

<p>
The army in retreat has the means of collecting provisions everywhere, and =
he
marches towards them, whilst the pursuer must have everything brought after
him, which, as long as he is in motion, even with the shortest lines of
communication, is difficult, and on that account begets scarcity from the v=
ery
first.
</p>

<p>
All that the country yields will be taken for the benefit of the retreating
army first, and will be mostly consumed. Nothing remains but wasted village=
s
and towns, fields from which the crops have been gathered, or which are
trampled down, empty wells, and muddy brooks.
</p>

<p>
The pursuing army, therefore, from the very first day, has frequently to
contend with the most pressing wants. On taking the enemy=E2=80=99s supplie=
s he
cannot reckon; it is only through accident, or some unpardonable blunder on=
 the
part of the enemy, that here and there some little falls into his hands.
</p>

<p>
Thus there can be no doubt that in countries of vast dimensions, and when t=
here
is no extraordinary disproportion between the belligerent powers, a relatio=
n
may be produced in this way between the military forces, which holds out to=
 the
defensive an immeasurably greater chance of a final result in his favour th=
an
he would have had if there had been a great battle on the frontier. Not onl=
y
does the probability of gaining a victory become greater through this
alteration in the proportions of the contending armies, but the prospects o=
f
great results from the victory are increased as well, through the change of
position. What a difference between a battle lost close to the frontier of =
our
country and one in the middle of the enemy=E2=80=99s country! Indeed, the
situation of the assailant is often such at the end of his first start, tha=
t
even a battle <i>gained</i> may force him to retreat, because he has neithe=
r
enough impulsive power left to complete and make use of a victory, nor is h=
e in
a condition to replace the forces he has lost.
</p>

<p>
There is, therefore, an immense difference between a decisive blow at the
commencement and at the end of the attack.
</p>

<p>
To the great advantage of this mode of defence are opposed two drawbacks. T=
he
first is the loss which the country suffers through the presence of the ene=
my
in his advance, the other is the moral impression.
</p>

<p>
To protect the country from loss can certainly never be looked upon as the
object of the whole defence. That object is an advantageous peace. To obtai=
n
that as surely as possible is the endeavour, and for it no momentary sacrif=
ice
must he considered too great. At the same time, the above loss, although it=
 may
not be decisive, must still be laid in the balance, for it always affects o=
ur
interests.
</p>

<p>
This loss does not affect our army directly; it only acts upon it in a more=
 or
less roundabout way, whilst the retreat itself directly reinforces our army=
. It
is, therefore, difficult to draw a comparison between the advantage and
disadvantage in this case; they are things of a different kind, the action =
of
which is not directed towards any common point. We must, therefore, content
ourselves with saying that the loss is greater when we have to sacrifice
fruitful provinces well populated, and large commercial towns; but it arriv=
es
at a maximum when at the same time we lose war-means either ready for use o=
r in
course of preparation.
</p>

<p>
The second counterpoise is the moral impression. There are cases in which t=
he
commander must be above regarding such a thing, in which he must quietly fo=
llow
out his plans, and run the risk of the objections which short-sighted
despondency may offer; but nevertheless, this impression is no phantom whic=
h
should be despised. It is not like a force which acts upon one point: but l=
ike
a force which, with the speed of lightning, penetrates every fibre, and
paralyses all the powers which should be in full activity, both in a nation=
 and
in its army. There are indeed cases in which the cause of the retreat into =
the
interior of the country is quickly understood by both nation and army, and
trust, as well as hope, are elevated by the step; but such cases are rare. =
More
usually, the people and the army cannot distinguish whether it is a volunta=
ry
movement or a precipitate retreat, and still less whether the plan is one
wisely adopted, with a view to ensure ulterior advantages, or the result of
fear of the enemy=E2=80=99s sword. The people have a mingled feeling of sym=
pathy
and dissatisfaction at seeing the fate of the provinces sacrificed; the arm=
y
easily loses confidence in its leaders, or even in itself, and the constant
combats of the rear-guard during the retreat, tend always to give new stren=
gth
to its fears. <i>These are consequences</i> of the retreat about which we m=
ust
never deceive ourselves. And it certainly is=E2=80=94considered in
itself=E2=80=94more natural, simpler, nobler, and more in accordance with t=
he
moral existence of a nation, to enter the lists at once, that the enemy may=
 out
cross the frontiers of its people without being opposed by its genius, and
being called to a bloody account.
</p>

<p>
These are the advantages and disadvantages of this kind of defence; now a f=
ew
words on its conditions and the circumstances which are in its favour.
</p>

<p>
A country of great extent, or at all events, a long line of retreat, is the
first and fundamental condition; for an advance of a few marches will natur=
ally
not weaken the enemy seriously. Buonaparte=E2=80=99s centre, in the year 18=
12, at
Witepsk, was 250,000 strong, at Smolensk, 182,000, at Borodino it had only
diminished to 130,000, that is to say, had fallen to about an equality with=
 the
Russian centre. Borodino is ninety miles from the frontier; but it was not
until they came near Moscow that the Russians reached that decided superior=
ity
in numbers, which of itself reversed the situation of the combatants so
assuredly, that the French victory at Malo Jaroslewetz could not essentiall=
y
alter it again.
</p>

<p>
No other European state has the dimensions of Russia, and in very few can a
line of retreat 100 miles long be imagined. But neither will a power such a=
s
that of the French in 1812, easily appear under different circumstances, st=
ill
less such a superiority in numbers as existed at the commencement of the
campaign, when the French army had more than double the numbers of its
adversary, besides its undoubted moral superiority. Therefore, what was her=
e
only effected at the end of 100 miles, may perhaps, in other cases, be atta=
ined
at the end of 50 or 30 miles.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances which favour this mode of defence are=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. A country only little cultivated.
</p>

<p>
2. A loyal and warlike people.
</p>

<p>
3. An inclement season.
</p>

<p>
All these things increase the difficulty of maintaining an army, render gre=
at
convoys necessary, many detachments, harassing duties, cause the spread of
sickness, and make operations against the flanks easier for the defender.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, we have yet to speak of the absolute mass alone of the armed force,=
 as
influencing the result.
</p>

<p>
It lies in the nature of the thing itself that, irrespective of the mutual
relation of the forces opposed to each other, a small force is sooner exhau=
sted
than a larger, and, therefore, that its career cannot be so long, nor its
theatre of war so wide. There is, therefore, to a certain extent, a constan=
t
relation between the absolute size of an army and the space which that army=
 can
occupy. It is out of the question to try to express this relation by any
figures, and besides, it will always be modified by other circumstances; it=
 is
sufficient for our purpose to say that these things necessarily have this
relation from their very nature. We may be able to march upon Moscow with
500,000 but not with 50,000, even if the relation of the invader=E2=80=99s =
army
to that of the defender in point of numbers were much more favourable in th=
e
latter case.
</p>

<p>
Now if we assume that there is this relation of absolute power to space in =
two
different cases, then it is certain that the effect of our retreat into the
interior in weakening the enemy will increase with the masses.
</p>

<p>
1. Subsistence and lodging of the troops become more difficult=E2=80=94for,
supposing the space which an army covers to increase in proportion to the s=
ize
of the army, still the subsistence for the army will never be obtainable fr=
om
this space alone, and everything which has to be brought after an army is
subject to greater loss also; the whole space occupied is never used for
covering for the troops, only a small part of it is required, and this does=
 not
increase in the same proportion as the masses.
</p>

<p>
2. The advance is in the same manner more tedious in proportion as the mass=
es
increase, consequently, the time is longer before the career of aggression =
is
run out, and the sum total of the daily losses is greater.
</p>

<p>
Three thousand men driving two thousand before them in an ordinary country,
will not allow them to march at the rate of 1, 2, or at most 3 miles a day,=
 and
from time to time to make a few days=E2=80=99 halt. To come up with them, t=
o
attack them, and force them to make a further retreat is the work of a few
hours; but if we multiply these masses by 100, the case is altered. Operati=
ons
for which a few hours sufficed in the first case, require now a whole day,
perhaps two. The contending forces cannot remain together near one point;
thereby, therefore, the diversity of movements and combinations increases, =
and,
consequently, also the time required. But this places the assailant at a
disadvantage, because his difficulty with subsistence being greater, he is
obliged to extend his force more than the pursued, and, therefore, is alway=
s in
danger of being overpowered by the latter at some particular point, as the
Russians tried to do at Witepsk.
</p>

<p>
3. The greater the masses are, the more severe are the exertions demanded f=
rom
each individual for the daily duties required strategically and tactically.=
 A
hundred thousand men who have to march to and from the point of assembly ev=
ery
day, halted at one time, and then set in movement again, now called to arms=
,
then cooking or receiving their rations=E2=80=94a hundred thousand who must=
 not
go into their bivouac until the necessary reports are delivered in from all
quarters=E2=80=94these men, as a rule, require for all these exertions conn=
ected
with the actual march, twice as much time as 50,000 would require, but ther=
e
are only twenty-four hours in the day for both. How much the time and fatig=
ue
of the march itself differs according to the size of the body of troops to =
be
moved, has been shown in the ninth chapter of the preceding book. Now, the
retreating army, it is true, partakes of these fatigues as well as the
advancing, but they are much greater for the latter:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. because the mass of his troops is greater on account of the superiority
which we supposed,
</p>

<p>
2. because the defender, by being always the party to yield ground, purchas=
es
by this sacrifice the right of the initiative, and, therefore, the right al=
ways
to give the law to the other. He forms his plan beforehand, which, in most
cases, he can carry out unaltered, but the aggressor, on the other hand, ca=
n
only make his plans conformably to those of his adversary, which he must in=
 the
first instance find out.
</p>

<p>
We must, however, remind our readers that we are speaking of the pursuit of=
 an
enemy who has not suffered a defeat, who has not even lost a battle. It is
necessary to mention this, in order that we may not be supposed to contradi=
ct
what was said in the twelfth chapter of our fourth book.
</p>

<p>
But this privilege of giving the law to the enemy makes a difference in sav=
ing
of time, expenditure of force, as well as in respect of other minor advanta=
ges
which, in the long run, becomes very important.
</p>

<p>
3. because the retreating force on the one hand does all he can to make his=
 own
retreat easy, repairs roads, and bridges, chooses the most convenient place=
s
for encampment, etc., and, on the other hand again, does all he can to thro=
w
impediments in the way of the pursuer, as he destroys bridges, by the mere =
act
of marching makes bad roads worse, deprives the enemy of good places for
encampment by occupying them himself, etc.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, we must add still, as a specially favourable circumstance, the war =
made
by the people. This does not require further examination here, as we shall
allot a chapter to the subject itself.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto, we have been engaged upon the advantages which such a retreat
ensures, the sacrifices which it requires, and the conditions which must ex=
ist;
we shall now say something of the mode of executing it.
</p>

<p>
The first question which we have to propose to ourselves is with reference =
to
the direction of the retreat.
</p>

<p>
It should be made into the <i>interior</i> of the country, therefore, if
possible, towards a point where the enemy will be surrounded on all sides b=
y
our provinces; there he will be exposed to their influence, and we shall no=
t be
in danger <i>of being separated from the principal mass of our territory</i=
>,
which might happen if we chose a line too near the frontier, as would have
happened to the Russians in 1812 if they had retreated to the south instead=
 of
the east.
</p>

<p>
This is the condition which lies in the object of the measure itself. Which
point in the country is the best, how far the choice of that point will acc=
ord
with the design of covering the capital or any other important point direct=
ly,
or drawing the enemy away from the direction of such important places depen=
ds
on circumstances.
</p>

<p>
If the Russians had well considered their retreat in 1812 beforehand, and,
therefore, made it completely in conformity with a regular plan, they might
easily, from Smolensk, have taken the road to Kaluga, which they only took =
on
leaving Moscow; it is very possible that under these circumstances Moscow w=
ould
have been entirely saved.
</p>

<p>
That is to say, the French were about 130,000 strong at Borodino, and there=
 is
no ground for assuming that they would have been any stronger if this battl=
e
had been fought by the Russians half way to Kaluga instead; now, how many o=
f
these men could they have spared to detach to Moscow? Plainly, very few; bu=
t it
is not with a few troops that an expedition can be sent a distance of fifty
miles (the distance from Smolensk to Moscow) against such a place as Moscow=
.
</p>

<p>
Supposing Buonaparte when at Smolensk, where he was 160,000 strong, had tho=
ught
he could venture to detach against Moscow before engaging in a great battle=
,
and had used 40,000 men for that purpose, leaving 120,000 opposite the
principal Russian army, in that case, these 120,000 men would not have been
more than 90,000 in the battle, that is 40,000 less than the number which
fought at Borodino; the Russians, therefore, would have had a superiority i=
n
numbers of 30,000 men. Taking the course of the battle of Borodino as a
standard, we may very well assume that with such a superiority they would h=
ave
been victorious. At all events, the relative situation of the parties would
have been more favourable for the Russians than it was at Borodino. But the
retreat of the Russians was not the result of a well-matured plan; they
retreated as far as they did because each time that they were on the point =
of
giving battle they did not consider themselves strong enough yet for a grea=
t
action; all their supplies and reinforcements were on the road from Moscow =
to
Smolensk, and it could not enter the head of anyone at Smolensk to leave th=
at
road. But, besides, a victory between Smolensk and Kaluga would never have
excused, in the eyes of the Russians, the offence of having left Moscow
uncovered, and exposed it to the possibility of being captured.
</p>

<p>
Buonaparte, in 1813, would have secured Paris with more certainty from an
attack if he had taken up a position at some distance in a lateral directio=
n,
somewhere behind the canal of Burgundy, leaving only with the large force o=
f
National Guard in Paris a few thousand regular troops. The allies would nev=
er
have had the courage to march a corps of 50,000 or 60,000 against Paris whi=
lst
Buonaparte was in the field at Auxerre with 100,000 men. If the case is
supposed reversed, and the allies in Buonaparte=E2=80=99s place, then no on=
e,
indeed, would have advised them to leave the road open to their own capital
with <i>Buonaparte</i> for their opponent. With such a preponderance he wou=
ld
not have hesitated a moment about marching on the capital. So different is =
the
effect under the same circumstances but under different moral relations.
</p>

<p>
As we shall have hereafter to return to this subject when treating of the p=
lan
of a war, we shall only at present add that, when such a lateral position i=
s
taken, the capital or place which it is the object to protect, must, in eve=
ry
case, be capable of making some resistance that it may not be occupied and =
laid
under contribution by every flying column or irregular band.
</p>

<p>
But we have still to consider another peculiarity in the direction of such =
a
line of retreat, that is, a sudden <i>change of direction</i>. After the
Russians had kept the same direction as far as Moscow they left that direct=
ion
which would have taken them to Wladimir, and after first taking the road to
Riazan for some distance, they then transferred their army to the Kaluga ro=
ad.
If they had been obliged to continue their retreat they could easily have d=
one
so in this new direction which would have led them to Kiew, therefore much
nearer again to the enemy=E2=80=99s frontier. That the French, even if they=
 had
still preserved a large numerical superiority over the Russians, could not =
have
maintained their line of communication by Moscow under such circumstances i=
s
clear in itself; they must have given up not only Moscow but, in all
probability, Smolensk also, therefore have again abandoned the conquests
obtained with so much toil, and contented themselves with a theatre of war =
on
this side the Beresina.
</p>

<p>
Now, certainly, the Russian army would thus have got into the same difficul=
ty
to which it would have exposed itself by taking the direction of Kiew at fi=
rst,
namely, that of being separated from the mass of its own territory; but thi=
s
disadvantage would now have become almost insignificant, for how different
would have been the condition of the French army if it had marched straight
upon Kiew without making the detour by Moscow.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that such a sudden <i>change of direction</i> of a line of
retreat, which is very practicable in a spacious country, ensures remarkabl=
e
advantages.
</p>

<p>
1. It makes it impossible for the enemy (the advancing force) to maintain h=
is
old line of communication: but the organisation of a new one is always a
difficult matter, in addition to which the change is made gradually, theref=
ore,
probably, he has to try more than one new line.
</p>

<p>
2. If both parties in this manner approach the frontier again; the position=
 of
the aggressor no longer covers his conquests, and he must in all probabilit=
y
give them up.
</p>

<p>
Russia with its enormous dimensions, is a country in which two armies might=
 in
this manner regularly play at prisoners=E2=80=99 base (Zeck jagen).
</p>

<p>
But such a change of the line of retreat is also possible in smaller countr=
ies,
when other circumstances are favourable, which can only be judged of in eac=
h
individual case, according to its different relations.
</p>

<p>
When the direction in which the enemy is to be drawn into the country is on=
ce
fixed upon, then it follows of itself that our principal army should take t=
hat
direction, for otherwise the enemy would not advance in that direction, and=
 if
he even did we should not then be able to impose upon him all the condition=
s
above supposed. The question then only remains whether we shall take this
direction with our forces undivided, or whether considerable portions shoul=
d
spread out laterally and therefore give the retreat a divergent (eccentric)
form.
</p>

<p>
To this we answer that this latter form in itself is to be rejected.
</p>

<p>
1. Because it divides our forces, whilst their concentration on one point i=
s
just one of the chief difficulties for the enemy.
</p>

<p>
2. Because the enemy gets the advantage of operating on interior lines, can
remain more concentrated than we are, consequently can appear in so much th=
e
greater force at any one point. Now certainly this superiority is less to b=
e
dreaded when we are following a system of constantly giving way; but the ve=
ry
condition of this constantly yielding, is always to continue formidable to =
the
enemy and not to allow him to beat us in detail, which might easily happen.=
 A
further object of such a retreat, is to bring our principal force by degree=
s to
a superiority of numbers, and with this superiority to give a decisive blow=
,
but that by a partition of forces would become an uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
3. Because as a general rule the concentric (convergent) action against the
enemy is not adapted to the weaker forces.
</p>

<p>
4. Because many disadvantages of the weak points of the aggression disappea=
r
when the defender=E2=80=99s army is divided into separate parts.
</p>

<p>
The weakest features in a long advance on the part of the aggressor are for
instance;=E2=80=94the length of the lines of communication, and the exposur=
e of
the strategic flanks. By the divergent form of retreat, the aggressor is
compelled to cause a portion of his force to show a front to the flank, and
this portion properly destined only to neutralise our force immediately in =
his
front, now effects to a certain extent something else in addition, by cover=
ing
a portion of the lines of communication.
</p>

<p>
For the mere strategic effect of the retreat, the divergent form is therefo=
re
not favourable; but if it is to prepare an action hereafter against the
enemy=E2=80=99s line of retreat, then we must refer to what has been said a=
bout
that in the last chapter.
</p>

<p>
There is <i>only one</i> object which can give occasion to a divergent retr=
eat,
that is when we can by that means protect provinces which otherwise the ene=
my
would occupy.
</p>

<p>
What sections of territory the advancing foe will occupy right and left of =
his
course, can with tolerable accuracy be discerned by the point of assembly o=
f,
and directions given to, his forces, by the situation of his own provinces,
fortresses, etc., in respect to our own. To place troops in those districts=
 of
territory which he will in all probability leave unoccupied, would be dange=
rous
waste of our forces. But now whether <i>by any disposition of our forces we
shall be able to hinder him</i> from occupying those districts which in all
probability he will desire to occupy, is more difficult to decide, and it i=
s
therefore a point, the solution of which depends much on tact of judgment.
</p>

<p>
When the Russians retreated in 1812, they left 30,000 men under Tormassow i=
n
Volhynia, to oppose the Austrian force which was expected to invade that
province. The size of the province, the numerous obstacles of ground which =
the
country presents, the near proportion between the forces likely to come int=
o
conflict justified the Russians in their expectations, that they would be a=
ble
to keep the upper hand in that quarter, or at least to maintain themselves =
near
to their frontier. By this, very important advantages might have resulted i=
n
the sequel, which we shall not stop here to discuss; besides this, it was
almost impossible for these troops to have joined the main army in time if =
they
had wished. For these reasons, the determination to leave these troops in
Volhynia to carry on there a distinct war of their own, was right. Now on t=
he
other hand, if according to the proposed plan of campaign submitted by Gene=
ral
Phul, only the army of Barclay (80,000 men), was to retire to Drissa, and
Bragathion=E2=80=99s army (40,000 men) was to remain on the right flank of =
the
French, with a view to subsequently falling on their rear, it is evident at
once that this corps could not possibly maintain itself in South Lithuania =
so
near to the rear of the main body of the French army, and would soon have b=
een
destroyed by their overwhelming masses.
</p>

<p>
That the defender=E2=80=99s interest in itself is to give up as few provinc=
es as
possible to the assailant is intelligible enough, but this is always a
secondary consideration; that the attack is also made more difficult the
smaller or rather narrower the theatre of war is to which we can confine th=
e
enemy, is likewise clear in itself; but all this is subordinate to the
condition that in so doing we have the probability of a result in our favou=
r,
and that the main body of the force on the defensive will not be too much
weakened; for upon that force we must chiefly depend for the final solution=
,
because the difficulties and distress suffered by the main body of the enem=
y,
first call forth his determination to retreat, and increase in the greatest
degree the loss of physical and moral power therewith connected.
</p>

<p>
The retreat into the interior of the country should therefore as a rule be =
made
directly before the enemy, and as slowly as possible, with an army which ha=
s
not suffered defeat and is undivided; and by its incessant resistance it sh=
ould
force the enemy to a constant state of readiness for battle, and to a ruino=
us
expenditure of forces in tactical and strategical measures of precaution.
</p>

<p>
When both sides have in this manner reached the end of the aggressor=E2=80=
=99s
first start, the defender should then dispose his army in a position, if su=
ch
can be found, forming an oblique angle with the route of his opponent, and
operate against the enemy=E2=80=99s rear with all the means at his command.
</p>

<p>
The campaign of 1812 in Russia shows all these measures on a great scale, a=
nd
their effects, as it were, in a magnifying glass. Although it was not a
voluntary retreat, we may easily consider it from that point of view. If th=
e
Russians with the experience they now have of the results to be thus produc=
ed,
had to undertake the defence of their country over again, exactly under the
same circumstances, they would do voluntarily and systematically what in gr=
eat
part was done without a definite plan in 1812; but it would be a great mist=
ake
to suppose that there neither is nor can be any instance elsewhere of the s=
ame
mode of action where the dimensions of the Russian empire are wanting.
</p>

<p>
Whenever a strategic attack, without coming to the issue of a battle, is
wrecked merely on the difficulties encountered, and the aggressor is compel=
led
to make a more or less disastrous retreat, there the chief conditions and
principal effects of this mode of defence will be found to have taken place=
,
whatever may be the modifying circumstances otherwise with which it is
accompanied. Frederick the Great=E2=80=99s campaign of 1742 in Moravia, of =
1744
in Bohemia, the French campaign of 1743 in Austria and Bohemia, the Duke of
Brunswick=E2=80=99s campaign of 1792 in France, Massena=E2=80=99s winter ca=
mpaign
of 1810=E2=80=9411 in Portugal, are all cases in which this is exemplified,
although in smaller proportions and relations; there are besides innumerabl=
e
fragmentary operations of this kind, the results of which, although not who=
lly,
are still partly to be ascribed to the principle which we here uphold; thes=
e we
do not bring forward, because it would necessitate a development of
circumstances which would lead us into too wide a field.
</p>

<p>
In Russia, and in the other cases cited, the crisis or turn of affairs took
place without any successful battle, having given the decision at the
culminating point; but even when such an effect is not to be expected, it i=
s
always a matter of immense importance in this mode of defence to bring abou=
t
such a relation of forces as makes victory possible, and through that victo=
ry,
as through a first blow, to cause a movement which usually goes on increasi=
ng
in its disastrous effects according to the laws applicable to falling bodie=
s.

<h3><a name=3D"chap91"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br>Arming the Nation</h3>

<p>
A people=E2=80=99s war in civilised Europe is a phenomenon of the nineteent=
h
century. It has its advocates and its opponents: the latter either consider=
ing
it in a political sense as a revolutionary means, a state of anarchy declar=
ed
lawful, which is as dangerous as a foreign enemy to social order at home; o=
r on
military grounds, conceiving that the result is not commensurate with the
expenditure of the nation=E2=80=99s strength. The first point does not conc=
ern us
here, for we look upon a people=E2=80=99s war merely as a means of fighting=
,
therefore, in its connection with the enemy; but with regard to the latter
point, we must observe that a people=E2=80=99s war in general is to be rega=
rded
as a consequence of the outburst which the military element in our day has =
made
through its old formal limits; as an expansion and strengthening of the who=
le
fermentation-process which we call war. The requisition system, the immense
increase in the size of armies by means of that system, and the general
liability to military service, the utilizing militia, are all things which =
lie
in the same direction, if we make the limited military system of former day=
s
our starting point; and the <i>lev=C3=A9e en masse</i>, or arming of the pe=
ople, now
lies also in the same direction. If the first named of these new aids to wa=
r
are the natural and necessary consequences of barriers thrown down; and if =
they
have so enormously increased the power of those who first used them, that t=
he
enemy has been carried along in the current, and obliged to adopt them
likewise, this will be the case also with people-wars. In the generality of
cases, the people who make judicious use of this means, will gain a
proportionate superiority over those who despise its use. If this be so, th=
en
the only question is whether this modern intensification of the military
element is, upon the whole, salutary for the interests of humanity or
otherwise,=E2=80=94a question which it would be about as easy to answer as =
the
question of war itself=E2=80=94we leave both to philosophers. But the opini=
on may
be advanced, that the resources swallowed up in people=E2=80=99s wars might=
 be
more profitably employed, if used in providing other military means; no ver=
y
deep investigation, however, is necessary to be convinced that these resour=
ces
are for the most part not disposable, and cannot be utilized in an arbitrar=
y
manner at pleasure. One essential part that is the moral element, is not ca=
lled
into existence until this kind of employment for it arises.
</p>

<p>
We therefore do not ask again: how much does the resistance which the whole
nation in arms is capable of making, cost that nation? but we ask: what is =
the
effect which such a resistance can produce? What are its conditions, and ho=
w is
it to be used?
</p>

<p>
It follows from the very nature of the thing that defensive means thus wide=
ly
dispersed, are not suited to great blows requiring concentrated action in t=
ime
and space. Its operation, like the process of evaporation in physical natur=
e,
is according to the surface. The greater that surface and the greater the
contact with the enemy=E2=80=99s army, consequently the more that army spre=
ads
itself out, so much the greater will be the effects of arming the nation. L=
ike
a slow gradual heat, it destroys the foundations of the enemy=E2=80=99s arm=
y. As
it requires time to produce its effects, therefore whilst the hostile eleme=
nts
are working on each other, there is a state of tension which either gradual=
ly
wears out if the people=E2=80=99s war is extinguished at some points, and b=
urns
slowly away at others, or leads to a crisis, if the flames of this general
conflagration envelop the enemy=E2=80=99s army, and compel it to evacuate t=
he
country to save itself from utter destruction. In order that this result sh=
ould
be produced by a national war alone, we must suppose either a surface-exten=
t of
the dominions invaded, exceeding that of any country in Europe, except Russ=
ia,
or suppose a disproportion between the strength of the invading army and th=
e
extent of the country, such as never occurs in reality. Therefore, to avoid
following a phantom, we must imagine a people-war always in combination, wi=
th a
war carried on by a regular army, and both carried on according to a plan
embracing the operations of the whole.
</p>

<p>
The conditions under which alone the people=E2=80=99s war can become effect=
ive
are the following=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. That the war is carried on in the heart of the country.
</p>

<p>
2. That it cannot be decided by a single catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
3. That the theatre of war embraces a considerable extent of country.
</p>

<p>
4. That the national character is favourable to the measure.
</p>

<p>
5. That the country is of a broken and difficult nature, either from being
mountainous, or by reason of woods and marshes, or from the peculiar mode o=
f
cultivation in use.
</p>

<p>
Whether the population is dense or otherwise, is of little consequence, as
there is less likelihood of a want of men than of anything else. Whether th=
e
inhabitants are rich or poor is also a point by no means decisive, at least=
 it
should not be; but it must be admitted that a poor population accustomed to
hard work and privations usually shows itself more vigorous and better suit=
ed
for war.
</p>

<p>
One peculiarity of country which greatly favors the action of war carried o=
n by
the people, is the scattered sites of the dwellings of the country people, =
such
as is to be found in many parts of Germany. The country is thus more
intersected an dcovered; the roads are worse, although more numerous; the
lodgement of troops is attended with endless difficulties, but especially t=
hat
peculiarity repeats itself on a small scale, which a people-war possesses o=
n a
great scale, namely that the principle of resistance exists everywhere, but=
 is
nowhere tangible. If the inhabitants are collected in villages, the most
troublesome have troops quartered on them, or they are plundered as a
punishment, and their houses burnt, etc, a system which could not be very
easily carried out with a peasant community of Westphalia.
</p>

<p>
National levies and armed peasantry cannot and should not be employed again=
st
the main body of the enemy=E2=80=99s army, or even against any considerable=
 corps
of the same, they must not attempt to crack the nut, they must only gnaw on=
 the
surface and the borders. They should rise in the provinces situated at one =
of
the sides of the theatre of war, and in which the assailant does not appear=
 in
force, in order to withdraw these provinces entirely from his influence. Wh=
ere
no enemy is to be found, there is no want of courage to oppose him, and at =
the
example thus given, the mass of the neighboring population gradually takes
fire. Thus the fire spreads as it does in heather, and reaching at last tha=
t
part of the surface of the soil on which the aggressor is based, it seizes =
his
lines of communication and preys upon the vital thread by which his existen=
ce
is supported. For although we entertain no exaggerated ideas of the omnipot=
ence
of a people=E2=80=99s war, such as that it is an inexhaustible, unconquerab=
le
element, over which the mere force of an army has as little control as the
human will has over the wind or the rain; in short, although our opinion is=
 not
founded on flowery ephemeral literature, still we must admit that armed
peasants are not to be driven before us in the same way as a body of soldie=
rs
who keep together like a herd of cattle, and usually follow their noses. Ar=
med
peasants, on the contrary, when broken, disperse in all directions, for whi=
ch
no formal plan is required; through this circumstance, the march of every s=
mall
body of troops in a mountainous, thickly wooded, or even broken country,
becomes a service of a very dangerous character, for at any moment a combat=
 may
arise on the march; if in point of fact no armed bodies have even been seen=
 for
some time, yet the same peasants already driven off by the head of a column=
,
may at any hour make their appearance in its rear. If it is an object to
destroy roads or to block up a defile; the means which outposts or detachme=
nts
from an army can apply to that purpose, bear about the same relation to tho=
se
furnished by a body of insurgent peasants, as the action of an automaton do=
es
to that of a human being. The enemy has no other means to oppose to the act=
ion
of national levies except that of detaching numerous parties to furnish esc=
orts
for convoys to occupy military stations, defiles, bridges, etc. In proporti=
on
as the first efforts of the national levies are small, so the detachments s=
ent
out will be weak in numbers, from the repugnance to a great dispersion of
forces; it is on these weak bodies that the fire of the national war usuall=
y
first properly kindles itself, they are overpowered by numbers at some poin=
ts,
courage rises, the love of fighting gains strength, and the intensity of th=
is
struggle increases until the crisis approaches which is to decide the issue=
.
</p>

<p>
According to our idea of a people=E2=80=99s war, it should, like a kind of
nebulous vapoury essence, never condense into a solid body; otherwise the e=
nemy
sends an adequate force against this core, crushes it, and makes a great ma=
ny
prisoners; their courage sinks; every one thinks the main question is decid=
ed,
any further effort useless, and the arms fall from the hands of the people.
Still, however, on the other hand, it is necessary that this mist should
collect at some points into denser masses, and form threatening clouds from
which now and again a formidable flash of lightning may burst forth. These
points are chiefly on the flanks of the enemy=E2=80=99s theatre of war, as
already observed. There the armament of the people should be organised into
greater and more systematic bodies, supported by a small force of regular
troops, so as to give it the appearance of a regular force and fit it to
venture upon enterprises on a larger scale. From these points, the irregula=
r
character in the organisation of these bodies should diminish in proportion=
 as
they are to be employed more in the direction of the rear of the enemy, whe=
re
he is exposed to their hardest blows. These better organised masses, are fo=
r
the purpose of falling upon the larger garrisons which the enemy leaves beh=
ind
him. Besides, they serve to create a feeling of uneasiness and dread, and
increase the moral impression of the whole, without them the total action w=
ould
be wanting in force, and the situation of the enemy upon the whole would no=
t be
made sufficiently uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way for a general to produce this more effective form of a nati=
onal
armament, is to support the movement by small detachments sent from the arm=
y.
Without the support of a few regular troops as an encouragement, the
inhabitants generally want an impulse, and the confidence to take up arms. =
The
stronger these detachments are, the greater will be their power of attracti=
on,
the greater will be the avalanche which is to fall down. But this has its
limits; partly, first, because it would be detrimental to the army to cut i=
t up
into detachments, for this secondary object to dissolve it, as it were, int=
o a
body of irregulars, and form with it in all directions a weak defensive lin=
e,
by which we may be sure both the regular army and national levies alike wou=
ld
become completely ruined; partly, secondly, because experience seems to tel=
l us
that when there are too many regular troops in a district, the people-war l=
oses
in vigour and efficacy; the causes of this are in the first place, that too
many of the enemy=E2=80=99s troops are thus drawn into the district, and, i=
n the
second place, that the inhabitants then rely on their own regular troops, a=
nd,
thirdly, because the presence of such large bodies of troops makes too grea=
t
demands on the powers of the people in other ways, that is, in providing
quarters, transport, contributions, etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
Another means of preventing any serious reaction on the part of the enemy
against this popular movement constitutes, at the same time, a leading
principle in the method of using such levies; this is, that as a rule, with
this great strategic means of defence, a tactical defence should seldom or =
ever
take place. The character of a <i>combat with national levies</i> is the sa=
me
as that of all combats of masses of troops of an inferior quality, great
impetuosity and fiery ardour at the commencement, but little coolness or
tenacity if the combat is prolonged. Further, the defeat and dispersion of =
a
body of national levies is of no material consequence, as they lay their
account with that, but a body of this description must not be broken up by
losses in killed, wounded, and prisoners; a defeat of that kind would soon =
cool
their ardour. But both these peculiarities are entirely opposed to the natu=
re
of a tactical defensive. In the defensive combat a persistent slow systemat=
ic
action is required, and great risks must be run; a mere attempt, from which=
 we
can desist as soon as we please, can never lead to results in the defensive=
.
If, therefore, the national levies are entrusted with the defence of any
particular portion of territory, care must be taken that the measure does n=
ot
lead to a regular great defensive combat; for if the circumstances were eve=
r so
favourable to them, they would be sure to be defeated. They may, and should=
,
therefore, defend the approaches to mountains, dykes, over marshes,
river-passages, as long as possible; but when once they are broken, they sh=
ould
rather disperse, and continue their defence by sudden attacks, than concent=
rate
and allow themselves to be shut up in some narrow last refuge in a regular
defensive position.=E2=80=94However brave a nation may be, however warlike =
its
habits, however intense its hatred of the enemy, however favourable the nat=
ure
of the country, it is an undeniable fact that a people=E2=80=99s war cannot=
 be
kept up in an atmosphere too full of danger. If, therefore, its combustible
material is to be fanned by any means into a considerable flame it must be =
at
remote points where there is more air, and where it cannot be extinguished =
by
one great blow.
</p>

<p>
After these reflections, which are more of the nature of subjective impress=
ions
than an objective analysis, because the subject is one as yet of rare
occurrence generally, and has been but imperfectly treated of by those who =
have
had actual experience for any length of time, we have only to add that the
strategic plan of defence can include in itself the cooperation of a genera=
l
arming of the people in two different ways, that is, either as a last resou=
rce
after a lost battle, or as a natural assistance before a decisive battle ha=
s
been fought. The latter case supposes a retreat into the interior of the
country, and that indirect kind of reaction of which we have treated in the
eighth and twenty-fourth chapters of this book. We have, therefore, here on=
ly
to say a few words on the mission of the national levies after a battle has
been lost.
</p>

<p>
No State should believe its fate, that is, its entire existence, to be
dependent upon one battle, let it be even the most decisive. If it is beate=
n,
the calling forth fresh power, and the natural weakening which every offens=
ive
undergoes with time, may bring about a turn of fortune, or assistance may c=
ome
from abroad. No such urgent haste to die is needed yet; and as by instinct =
the
drowning man catches at a straw, so in the natural course of the moral worl=
d a
people should try the last means of deliverance when it sees itself hurried
along to the brink of an abyss.
</p>

<p>
However small and weak a State may be in comparison to its enemy, if it
foregoes a last supreme effort, we must say there is no longer any soul lef=
t in
it. This does not exclude the possibility of saving itself from complete
destruction by the purchase of peace at a sacrifice; but neither does such =
an
aim on its part do away with the utility of fresh measures for defence; the=
y
will neither make peace more difficult nor more onerous, but easier and bet=
ter.
They are still more necessary if there is an expectation of assistance from
those who are interested in maintaining our political existence. Any
government, therefore, which, after the loss of a great battle, only thinks=
 how
it may speedily place the nation in the lap of peace, and unmanned by the
feeling of great hopes disappointed, no longer feels in itself the courage =
or
the desire to stimulate to the utmost every element of force, completely
stultifies itself in such case through weakness, and shows itself unworthy =
of
victory, and, perhaps, just on that account, was incapable of gaining one.
</p>

<p>
However decisive, therefore, the overthrow may be which is experienced by a
State, still by a retreat of the army into the interior, the efficacy of it=
s
fortresses and an arming of the people may be brought into use. In connecti=
on
with this it is advantageous if the flank of the principal theatre of war i=
s
fenced in by mountains, or otherwise very difficult tracts of country, whic=
h
stand forth as bastions, the strategic enfilade of which is to check the
enemy=E2=80=99s progress.
</p>

<p>
If the victorious enemy is engaged in siege works, if he has left strong
garrisons behind him everywhere to secure his communications, or detached c=
orps
to make himself elbow-room, and to keep the adjacent provinces in subjectio=
n,
if he is already weakened by his various losses in active means and materia=
l of
war, then the moment is arrived when the defensive army should again enter =
the
lists, and by a well-directed blow make the assailant stagger in his
disadvantageous position.

<h3><a name=3D"chap92"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br>Defence of a Theatre of War</h=
3>

<p>
Having treated of the <i>most important defensive means</i>, we might perha=
ps
be contented to leave the manner in which these means attach themselves to =
the
plan of defence as a whole to be discussed in the last Book, which will be
devoted to the <i>Plan of a War;</i> for from this every secondary scheme,
either of attack or defence, emanates and is determined in its leading
features; and moreover in many cases the plan of the war itself is nothing =
more
than the plan of the attack or defence of the principal theatre of war. But=
 we
have not been able to commence with war as a whole, although in war more th=
an
in any other phase of human activity, the parts are shaped by the whole, im=
bued
with and essentially altered by its character; instead of that, we have bee=
n
obliged to make ourselves thoroughly acquainted, in the first instance, wit=
h
each single subject as a separate part. Without this progress from the simp=
le
to the complex, a number of undefined ideas would have overpowered us, and =
the
manifold phases of reciprocal action in particular would have constantly
confused our conceptions. We shall therefore still continue to advance towa=
rds
the whole by one step at a time; that is, we shall consider the defence of =
a
theatre in itself, and look for the thread by which the subjects already
treated of connect themselves with it.
</p>

<p>
The defensive, according to our conception, is nothing <i>but the stronger =
form
of combat</i>. The preservation of our own forces and the destruction of th=
ose
of the enemy=E2=80=94in a word, the <i>victory</i>=E2=80=94is the aim of th=
is
contest, but at the same time not its ultimate object.
</p>

<p>
That object is the preservation of our own political state and the subjugat=
ion
of that of the enemy; or again, in one word, the <i>desired peace</i>, beca=
use
it is only by it that this conflict adjusts itself, and ends in a common
result.
</p>

<p>
But what is the enemy=E2=80=99s state in connection with war? Above all thi=
ngs
its military force is important, then its territory; but certainly there ar=
e
also still many other things which, through particular circumstances, may
obtain a predominant importance; to these belong, before all, foreign and
domestic political relations, which sometimes decide more than all the rest=
.
But although the military force and the territory of the enemy alone are st=
ill
not the state itself, nor are they the only connections which the state may
have with the war, still these two things are always preponderating, mostly
immeasurably surpassing all other connections in importance. Military force=
 is
to protect the territory of the state, or to conquer that of an enemy; the
territory on the other hand, constantly nourishes and renovates the militar=
y
force. The two, therefore, depend on each other, mutually support each othe=
r,
are equal in importance one to the other. But still there is a difference i=
n
their mutual relations. If the military force is destroyed, that is complet=
ely
defeated, rendered incapable of further resistance, then the loss of the
territory follows of itself; but on the other hand, the destruction of the
military force by no means follows from the conquest of the country, becaus=
e
that force may of its own accord evacuate the territory, in order afterward=
s to
reconquer it the more easily. Indeed, not only does the <i>complete</i>
destruction of its army decide the fate of a country, but even every
<i>considerable weakening</i> of its military force leads regularly to a lo=
ss
of territory; on the other hand, every considerable loss of territory does =
not
cause a proportionate diminution of military power; in the long run it will=
 do
so, but not always within the space of time in which a war is brought to a
close.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows that the preservation of our own military power, and t=
he
diminution or destruction of that of the enemy, take precedence in importan=
ce
over the occupation of territory, and, therefore, is the <i>first object</i=
>
which a general should strive for. The possession of territory only presses=
 for
consideration <i>as an object</i> if that means (diminution or destruction =
of
the enemy=E2=80=99s military force) has not effected it.
</p>

<p>
If the whole of the enemy=E2=80=99s military power was united in <i>one arm=
y</i>,
and if the whole war consisted of <i>one battle</i>, then the possession of=
 the
country would depend on the issue of that battle; destruction of the
enemy=E2=80=99s military forces, conquest of his country and security of ou=
r own,
would follow from that result, and, in a certain measure, be identical with=
 it.
Now the question is, what can induce the defensive to deviate from this
simplest form of the act of warfare, and distribute his power in space? The
answer is, the insufficiency of the victory which he might gain with all hi=
s
forces united. Every victory has its sphere of influence. If this extends o=
ver
the whole of the enemy=E2=80=99s state, consequently over the whole of his
military force and his territory, that is, if all the parts are carried alo=
ng
in the same movement, which we have impressed upon the core of his power, t=
hen
such a victory is all that we require, and a division of our forces would n=
ot
be justified by sufficient grounds. But if there are portions of the
enemy=E2=80=99s military force, and of country belonging to either party, o=
ver
which our victory would have no effect, then we must give particular attent=
ion
to those parts; and as we cannot unite territory like a military force in o=
ne
point, therefore we must divide our forces for the purpose of attacking or
defending those portions.
</p>

<p>
It is only in small, compactly shaped states that it is possible to have su=
ch a
unity of military force, and that probably all depends upon a victory over
<i>that force</i>. Such a unity is practically impossible when larger tract=
s of
country, having for a great extent boundaries conterminious with our own, a=
re
concerned, or in the case of an alliance of several surrounding states agai=
nst
us. In such cases, divisions of force must necessarily take place, giving
occasion to different theatres of war.
</p>

<p>
The effect of a victory will naturally depend on its <i>greatness</i>, and =
that
on the mass of the <i>conquered troops</i>. Therefore <i>the blow</i> which=
, if
successful, will produce the greatest effect, must be made against <i>that
part</i> of the country where the greatest number of the enemy=E2=80=99s fo=
rces
are collected together; and the greater the mass of our own forces which we=
 use
for this blow, so much the surer shall we be of this success. This natural
sequence of ideas leads us to an illustration by which we shall see this tr=
uth
more clearly; it is the nature and effect of the centre of gravity in
mechanics.
</p>

<p>
As the centre of gravity is always situated where the greatest mass of matt=
er
is collected, and as a shock against the centre of gravity of a body always
produces the greatest effect, and further, as the most effective blow is st=
ruck
with the centre of gravity of the power used, so it is also in war. The arm=
ed
forces of every belligerent, whether of a single state or of an alliance of
states, have a certain unity, and in that way, connection; but where connec=
tion
is there come in analogies of the centre of gravity. There are, therefore, =
in
these armed forces certain centres of gravity, the movement and direction o=
f
which decide upon other points, and these centres of gravity are situated w=
here
the greatest bodies of troops are assembled. But just as, in the world of i=
nert
matter, the action against the centre of gravity has its measure and limits=
 in
the connection of the parts, so it is in war, and here as well as there the
force exerted may easily be greater than the resistance requires, and then
there is a blow in the air, a waste of force.
</p>

<p>
What a difference there is between the solidity of an army under <i>one</i>
standard, led into battle under the personal command of <i>one</i> general,=
 and
that of an <i>allied army</i> extended over 50 or 100 miles, or it may be e=
ven
based upon quite different sides (of the theatre of war). There we see
coherence in the strongest degree, unity most complete; here unity in a ver=
y
remote degree often only existing in the political view held in common, and=
 in
that also in a miserable and insufficient degree, the cohesion of parts mos=
tly
very weak, often quite an illusion.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if on the one hand, the violence with which we wish to strike th=
e
blow prescribes the greatest concentration of force, so in like manner, on =
the
other hand, we have to fear every undue excess as a real evil, because it
entails a waste of power, and that in turn a <i>deficiency</i> of power at
other points.
</p>

<p>
To distinguish these =E2=80=9C<i>centra gravitatis</i>=E2=80=9D in the
enemy=E2=80=99s military power, to discern their spheres of action is, ther=
efore,
a supreme act of strategic judgment. We must constantly ask ourselves, what
effect the advance or retreat of part of the forces on either side will pro=
duce
on the rest.
</p>

<p>
We do not by this lay claim in any way to the discovery of a new method, we
have only sought to explain the foundation of the method of all generals, i=
n
every age, in a manner which may place its connection with the nature of th=
ings
in a clearer light.
</p>

<p>
How this conception of the centre of gravity of the enemy=E2=80=99s force a=
ffects
the whole plan of the war, we shall consider in the last book, for that is =
the
proper place for the subject, and we have only borrowed it from there to av=
oid
leaving any break in the sequence of ideas. By the introduction of this vie=
w we
have seen the motives which occasion a partition of forces in general. Thes=
e
consist fundamentally of two interests which are in opposition to each othe=
r;
the one, <i>the possession of territory</i> strives to divide the forces; t=
he
other, <i>the effort of force against the centre of gravity of the
enemy=E2=80=99s military power</i>, combines them again up to a certain poi=
nt.
</p>

<p>
Thus it is that theatres of war or particular army regions originate. These=
 are
those boundaries of the area of the country and of the forces thereon
distributed, within which every decision given by the principal force of su=
ch a
region extends itself <i>directly</i> over the whole, and carries on the wh=
ole
with it in its own direction. We say <i>directly</i>, because a decision on=
 one
theatre of war must naturally have also an influence more or less over thos=
e
adjoining it.
</p>

<p>
Although it lies quite in the nature of the thing, we must again remind our
readers expressly that here as well as everywhere else our definitions are =
only
directed at the centres of certain speculative regions, the limits of which=
 we
neither desire to, nor can we, define by sharp lines.
</p>

<p>
We think, therefore, a theatre of war, whether large or small, with its
military force, whatever may be the size of that, represents a unity which
maybe reduced to one centre of gravity. At this centre of gravity the decis=
ion
must take place, and to be conqueror here means to defend the theatre of wa=
r in
the widest sense.

<h3><a name=3D"chap93"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>Defence of a Theatre of War=
=E2=80=94(<i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>
Defence, however, consists of two different elements, these are the
<i>decision</i> and the <i>state of expectation</i>. The combination of the=
se
two elements forms the subject of this chapter.
</p>

<p>
First we must observe that the state of expectation is not, in point of fac=
t,
the complete defence; it is only that province of the same in which it proc=
eeds
to its aim. As long as a military force has not abandoned the portion of
territory placed under its guardianship, the tension of forces on both side=
s
created by the attack continues, and this lasts until there is a decision. =
The
decision itself can only be regarded as having actually taken place when ei=
ther
the assailant or defender has left the theatre of war.
</p>

<p>
As long as an armed force maintains itself within its theatre, the defence =
of
the same continues, and in this sense the defence of the theatre of war is
identical with the defence <i>in the same</i>. Whether the enemy in the
meantime has obtained possession of much or little of that section of count=
ry
is not essential, for it is only lent to him until the decision.
</p>

<p>
But this kind of idea by which we wish to settle the proper relation of the
state of expectation to the whole is only correct when a decision is really=
 to
take place, and is regarded by both parties as inevitable. For it is only b=
y
that decision that the centres of gravity of the respective forces, and the
theatre of war determined through them are <i>effectually</i> hit. Whenever=
 the
idea of a decisive solution disappears, then the centres of gravity are
neutralised, indeed, in a certain sense, the whole of the armed forces beco=
me
so also, and now the possession of territory, which forms the second princi=
pal
branch of the whole theatre of war, comes forward as the direct object. In
other words, the less a decisive blow is sought for by both sides in a war,=
 and
the more it is merely a mutual observation of one another, so much the more
important becomes the possession of territory, so much the more the defensi=
ve
seeks to cover all directly, and the assailant seeks to extend his forces i=
n
his advance.
</p>

<p>
Now we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that the majority of wars and
campaigns approach much more to a state of observation than to a struggle f=
or
life or death, that is, a contest in which one at least of the combatants u=
ses
every effort to bring about a complete decision. This last character is onl=
y to
be found in the wars of the nineteenth century to such a degree that a theo=
ry
founded on this point of view can be made use of in relation to them. But a=
s
all future wars will hardly have this character, and it is rather to be
expected that they will again show a tendency to the observation character,
therefore any theory to be practically useful must pay attention to that. H=
ence
we shall commence with the case in which the desire of a decision permeates=
 and
guides the whole, therefore with <i>real</i>, or if we may use the expressi=
on,
<i>absolute war;</i> then in another chapter we shall examine those
modifications which arise through the approach, in a greater or less degree=
, to
the state of a war of observation.
</p>

<p>
In the first case (whether the decision is sought by the aggressor or the
defender) the defence of the theatre of war must consist in the defender
establishing himself there in such a manner, that in a decision he will hav=
e an
advantage on his side at any moment. This decision may be either a battle, =
or a
series of great combats, but it may also consist in the resultant of mere
relations, which arise from the situation of the opposing forces, that is,
<i>possible combats</i>.
</p>

<p>
If the battle were not also the most powerful, the most usual and most
effectual means of a decision in war, as we think we have already shown on
several occasions, still the mere fact of its being in a general way one of=
 the
means of reaching this solution, would be sufficient to enjoin <i>the great=
est
concentration of our forces</i> which circumstances will in any way permit.=
 A
great battle upon the theatre of war is the blow of the centre of force aga=
inst
the centre of force; the more forces can be collected in the one or the oth=
er,
the surer and greater will be the effect. Therefore every separation of for=
ces
which is not called for by an object (which either cannot itself be attaine=
d by
the successful issue of a battle, or which itself is necessary to the
successful issue of the battle) is <i>blameable</i>.
</p>

<p>
But the greatest concentration of forces is not the only fundamental condit=
ion;
it is also requisite that they should have such a position and place that t=
he
battle may be fought under favourable circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The different steps in the defence which we have become acquainted with in =
the
chapter on the methods of defence, are completely homogeneous with these
fundamental conditions; there will therefore be no difficulty in connecting
them with the same, according to the special requirements of each case. But
there is one point which seems at first sight to involve a contradiction in
itself, and which, as one of the most important in the defence, requires
explanation so much the more. It is the hitting upon the exact centre of
gravity of the enemy=E2=80=99s force.
</p>

<p>
If the defender ascertains in time the roads by which the enemy will advanc=
e,
and upon which in particular the great mass of his force will be found for =
a
certainty, he may march against him on that road. This will be the most usu=
al
case, for although the defence precedes the attack in measures of a general
nature, in the establishment of strong places, great arsenals, and dep=C3=
=B4ts, and
in the peace establishment of his army, and thus gives a line of direction =
to
the assailant in his preparations, still, when the campaign really opens, t=
he
defender, in relation to the aggressor, has the peculiar advantage in gener=
al
of playing the last hand.
</p>

<p>
To attack a foreign country with a large army, very considerable preparatio=
ns
are required. Provisions, stores, and articles of equipment of all kinds mu=
st
be collected, which is a work of time. While these preparations are going o=
n,
the defender has time to prepare accordingly, in regard to which we must no=
t
forget that the defensive requires less time, generally speaking, because i=
n
every state things are prepared rather for the defensive than the offensive=
.
</p>

<p>
But although this may hold good in the majority of cases, there is always a
possibility that, in particular cases, the defensive may remain in uncertai=
nty
as to the principal line by which the enemy intends to advance; and this ca=
se
is more likely to occur when the defence is dependent on measures which of
themselves take a good deal of time, as for example, the preparation of a
strong position. Further, supposing the defender places himself on the line=
 by
which the aggressor is advancing, then, unless the defender is prepared to =
take
the initiative by attacking the aggressor, the latter may avoid the positio=
n
which the defender has taken up, by only altering a little his line of adva=
nce,
for in the cultivated parts of Europe we can never be so situated that ther=
e
are not roads to the right or left by which any position may be avoided.
Plainly, in such a case the defender could not wait for his enemy in a
position, or at least could not wait there in the expectation of giving bat=
tle.
</p>

<p>
But before entering on the means available to the defensive in this case, w=
e
must inquire more particularly into the nature of such a case, and the
probability of its occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Naturally there are in every State, and also in every theatre of war (of wh=
ich
alone we are at present speaking), objects and points upon which an attack =
is
likely to be more efficacious than anywhere else. Upon this we think it wil=
l be
better to speak when we come to the attack. Here we shall confine ourselves=
 to
observing that, if the most advantageous object and point of attack is the
motive for the assailant in the direction of his blow, this motive reacts o=
n
the defensive, and must be his guide in cases in which he knows nothing of =
the
intentions of his adversary. If the assailant does not take this direction
which is favourable to him, he foregoes part of his natural advantages. It =
is
evident that, if the defender has taken up a position in that direction, th=
e
evading his position, or passing round, is not to be done for nothing; it c=
osts
a sacrifice. From this it follows that there is not on the side of the defe=
nder
such a risk of <i>missing the direction of his enemy;</i> neither on the ot=
her
hand, is it so easy for the assailant <i>to pass round his adversary</i> as
appears at first sight, because there exists beforehand a very distinct, an=
d in
most cases preponderating, motive in favour of one or the other direction, =
and
that consequently the defender, although his preparations are fixed to one
spot, will not fail in most cases to come in contact with the mass of the
enemy=E2=80=99s forces. In other words, <i>if the defender has put himself =
in the
right position, he may be almost sure that the assailant will come to meet
him.</i>
</p>

<p>
But by this we shall not and cannot deny the possibility of the defender
sometimes not meeting with the assailant after all these arrangements, and
therefore the question arises, what he should then do, and how much of the =
real
advantages of his position still remain available to him.
</p>

<p>
If we ask ourselves what means still remain generally to the defender when =
the
assailant passes by his position, they are the following:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. To divide his forces instantly, so as to be certain to find the assailan=
t
with one portion, and then to support that portion with the other.
</p>

<p>
2. To take up a position with his force united, and in case the assailant
passes by him, to push on rapidly in front of him by a lateral movement. In
most cases there will not be time to make such a movement directly to a fla=
nk,
it will therefore be necessary to take up the new position somewhat further
back.
</p>

<p>
3. With his whole force to attack the enemy in flank.
</p>

<p>
4. To operate against his communications.
</p>

<p>
5. By a counter attack on <i>his</i> theatre of war, to do exactly what the
enemy has done in passing by us.
</p>

<p>
We introduce this last measure, because it is possible to imagine a case in
which it may be efficacious; but as it is in contradiction to the object of=
 the
defence, that is, the grounds on which that form has been chosen, therefore=
 it
can only be regarded as an abnormity, which can only take place because the
enemy has made some great mistake, or because there are other special featu=
res
in a particular case.
</p>

<p>
Operating against the enemy=E2=80=99s communications implies that our own a=
re
superior, which is also one of the fundamental requisites of a good defensi=
ve
position. But although on that ground this action may promise the defender =
a
certain amount of advantage, still, in the defence of a theatre of war, it =
is
seldom an operation suited to <i>lead to a decision</i>, which we have supp=
osed
to be the object of the campaign.
</p>

<p>
The dimensions of a single theatre of war are seldom so large that the line=
 of
communications is exposed to much danger by their length, and even if they =
were
in danger, still the time which the assailant requires for the execution of=
 his
blow is usually too short for his progress to be arrested by the slow effec=
ts
of the action against his communications.
</p>

<p>
Therefore this means (that is the action against the communications) will p=
rove
quite inefficacious in most cases against an enemy determined upon a decisi=
on,
and also in case the defender seeks such a solution.
</p>

<p>
The object of the three other means which remain for the defender, is a dir=
ect
decision=E2=80=94a meeting of centre of force with centre of force; they
correspond better, therefore, with the thing required. But we shall at once=
 say
that we decidedly prefer the third to the other two, and without quite
rejecting the latter, we hold the former to be in the majority of cases the
true means of defence.
</p>

<p>
In a position where our forces are divided, there is always a danger of get=
ting
involved in a war of posts, from which, if our adversary is resolute, can
follow, under the best of circumstances, only <i>a relative defence on a la=
rge
scale</i>, never a decision such as we desire; and even if by superior tact=
 we
should be able to avoid this mistake, still, by the preliminary resistance
being with divided forces, the first shock is sensibly weakened, and we can
never be sure that the advanced corps first engaged will not suffer
disproportionate losses. To this is to be added that the resistance of this
corps which usually ends in its falling back on the main body, appears to t=
he
troops in the light of a lost combat, or miscarriage of plans, and the mora=
l
force suffers accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The second means, that of placing our whole force in front of the enemy, in
whichever direction he may bend his march, involves a risk of our arriving =
too
late, and thus between two measures, falling short of both. Besides this, a
defensive battle requires coolness and consideration, a knowledge, indeed
intimate knowledge of the country, which cannot be expected in a hasty obli=
que
movement to a flank. Lastly, positions suitable for a good defensive
battle-field are too rarely to be met with to reckon upon them at every poi=
nt
of every road.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the third means, namely to attack the enemy in flank,
therefore to give battle with a change of front, is attended with great
advantages.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, there is always in this case, as we know, an exposure of the lines=
 of
communication, here the lines of retreat, and in this respect the defender =
has
one advantage in his general relations as defender, and next and chiefly, t=
he
advantage which we have claimed for the strategic properties of his positio=
n at
present.
</p>

<p>
Secondly,=E2=80=94and this is the principal thing,=E2=80=94every assailant =
who
attempts to pass by his opponent is placed between two opposite tendencies.=
 His
first desire is to advance to attain the object of his attack; but the
possibility of being attacked in flank at any moment, creates a necessity f=
or
being prepared, at any moment, to deliver a blow in that direction, and tha=
t
too a blow with the mass of his forces. These two tendencies are contradict=
ory,
and beget such a complication in the internal relations (of his army), such=
 a
difficulty in the choice of measures, if they are to suit every event, that
there can hardly be a more disagreeable position strategically. If the
assailant knew with certainty the moment when he would be attacked, he migh=
t
prepare to receive the enemy with skill and ability; but in his uncertainty=
 on
this point, and pressed by the necessity of advancing, it is almost certain
that when the moment for battle arrives, it finds him in the midst of hurri=
ed
and half-finished preparations, and therefore by no means in an advantageou=
s
relation to his enemy.
</p>

<p>
If then there are favourable moments for the defender to deliver an offensi=
ve
battle, it is surely at such a moment as this, above all others, that we ma=
y
look for success. If we consider, further, that the knowledge of the countr=
y
and choice of ground are on the side of the defender, that he can prepare h=
is
movements, and can time them, no one can doubt that he possesses in such a
situation a decided superiority, strategically, over his adversary.
</p>

<p>
We think, therefore, that a defender occupying a well chosen position, with=
 his
forces united, may quietly wait for the enemy passing by his army; should t=
he
enemy not attack him in his position, and that an operation against the
enemy=E2=80=99s communications does not suit the circumstances, there still
remains for him an excellent means of bringing about a decision by resortin=
g to
a flank attack.
</p>

<p>
If cases of this kind are hardly to be found in military history, the reaso=
n
is, partly, that the defender has seldom had the courage to remain firm in =
such
a position, but has either divided his forces, or rashly thrown himself in
front of his enemy by a cross or diagonal march, or that no assailant dares=
 to
venture past the defender under such circumstances, and in that way his
movement usually comes to a stand still.
</p>

<p>
The defender is in this case compelled to resort to an offensive battle: th=
e
further advantages of <i>the state of expectation of a strong position, of =
good
entrenchments</i>, etc., etc., he must give up; in most cases the situation=
 in
which he finds the advancing enemy will not quite make up for these advanta=
ges,
for it is just to evade their influence that the assailant has placed himse=
lf
in his present situation; still it always offers him <i>a certain
compensation</i>, and theory is therefore not just obliged to see a quantit=
y
disappear at once from the calculation, to see the pro and contra mutually
cancel each other, as so often happens when critical writers of history
introduce a little bit of theory.
</p>

<p>
It must not, in fact, be supposed that we are now dealing with logical
subtilties; the subject is rather one which the more it is practically
considered, the more it appears as an idea embracing the whole essence of
defensive war, everywhere dominating and regulating it.
</p>

<p>
It is only by the determination on the part of the defender to assail his
opponent with all his force, the moment he passes by him, that he avoids tw=
o
pitfalls, close to which he is led by the defensive form; that is a divisio=
n of
his force, and a hasty flank march to intercept the assailant in front. In =
both
he accepts the law of the assailant; in both he seeks to aid himself throug=
h
measures of a very critical nature, and with a most dangerous degree of has=
te;
and wherever a resolute adversary, thirsting for victory and a decision, ha=
s
encountered such a system of defence, he has knocked it on the head. But wh=
en
the defender has assembled his forces at the right point to fight a general
action, if he is determined with this force, come what will, to attack his
enemy in flank, he has done right, and is in the <i>right</i> course, and h=
e is
supported by all the advantages which the defence can give in his situation=
;
his actions will then bear the stamp <i>of good preparation, coolness,
security, unity and simplicity.</i>
</p>

<p>
We cannot here avoid mentioning a remarkable event in history, which has a
close analogy with the ideas now developed; we do so to anticipate its bein=
g
used in a wrong application.
</p>

<p>
When the Prussian army was, in October, 1806, waiting in Thuringia for the
French under Buonaparte, the former was posted between the two great roads =
on
which the latter might be expected to advance, that is, the road to Berlin =
by
Erfurth, and that by Hof and Leipsic. The first intention of breaking into
Franconia straight through the Thuringian Forest, and afterwards, when that
plan was abandoned, the uncertainty as to which of the roads the French wou=
ld
choose for their advance, caused this intermediate position. As such, it mu=
st
therefore have led to the adoption of the measure we have been discussing, =
a
hasty interception of the enemy in front by a lateral movement.
</p>

<p>
This was in fact the idea in case the enemy marched by Erfurth, for the roa=
ds
in that direction were good; on the other hand, the idea of a movement of t=
his
description on the road by Hof could not be entertained, partly because the
army was two or three marches away from that road, partly because the deep
valley of the Saale interposed; neither did this plan ever enter into the v=
iews
of the Duke of Brunswick, so that there was no kind of preparation made for
carrying it into effect, but it was always contemplated by Prince Hohenlohe=
,
that is, by Colonel Massenbach, who exerted all his influence to draw the D=
uke
into this plan. Still less could the idea be entertained of leaving the
position which had been taken on the left bank of the Saale to try an offen=
sive
battle against Buonaparte on his advance, that is, to such an attack in fla=
nk
as we have been considering; for if the Saale was an obstacle to intercepti=
ng
the enemy in the last moment (<i>=C3=A0 fortiori</i>) it would be a still g=
reater
obstacle to assuming the offensive at a moment when the enemy would be in
possession of the opposite side of the river, at least partially. The Duke,
therefore, determined to wait behind the Saale to see what would happen, th=
at
is to say, if we can call anything a determination which emanated from this
many-headed Headquarters=E2=80=99 Staff, and in this time of confusion and =
utter
indecision.
</p>

<p>
Whatever may have been the true condition of affairs during this state of
expectation, the consequent situation of the army was this:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. That the enemy might be attacked if he crossed the Saale to attack the
Prussian army.
</p>

<p>
2. That if he did not march against that army, operations might be commence=
d
against his communications.
</p>

<p>
3. If it should be found practicable and advisable, he might be intercepted
near Leipsic by a rapid flank march.
</p>

<p>
In the first case, the Prussian army possessed a great strategic and tactic=
al
advantage in the deep valley of the Saale. In the second, the strategic
advantage was just as great, for the enemy had only a very narrow base betw=
een
our position and the neutral territory of Bohemia, whilst ours was extremel=
y
broad; even in the third case, our army, covered by the Saale, was still by=
 no
means in a disadvantageous situation. All these three measures, in spite of=
 the
confusion and want of any clear perception at head-quarters, <i>were really
discussed;</i> but certainly we cannot wonder that, although a right idea m=
ay
have been entertained, it should have entirely failed in the <i>execution</=
i>
by the complete want of resolution and the confusion generally prevailing.
</p>

<p>
In the two first cases, the position on the left bank of the Saale is to be
regarded as a real flank position, and it had undoubtedly as such very grea=
t
qualities; but in truth, against a very superior enemy, <i>against a
Buonaparte</i>, a flank position with an army that is not very sure about w=
hat
it is doing, <i>is a very bold measure</i>.
</p>

<p>
After long hesitation, the Duke on the 13th adopted the last of the plans
proposed, but it was too late, Buonaparte had already commenced to pass the
Saale, and the battles of Jena and Auerstadt were inevitable. The Duke, thr=
ough
his indecision, had set himself between two stools; he quitted his first
position too late <i>to push his army in before the enemy</i>, and too soon=
 for
a battle suited to the object. Nevertheless, the natural strength of this
position proved itself so far that the Duke was able to destroy the right w=
ing
of the enemy=E2=80=99s army at Auerstadt, whilst Prince Hohenlohe, by a blo=
ody
retreat, was still able to back out of the scrape; but at Auerstadt they di=
d
not venture to realise the victory, which was <i>quite certain;</i> and at =
Jena
they thought they might reckon upon one which was <i>quite impossible</i>.
</p>

<p>
In any case, Buonaparte felt the strategic importance of the position on th=
e
Saale so much, that he did not venture to pass it by, but determined on a
passage of the Saale in sight of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
By what we have now said we think we have sufficiently specified the relati=
ons
between the defence and the attack when a decisive course of action is
intended, and we believe we have shown also the threads to which, according=
 to
their situation and connection, the different subjects of the plan of defen=
ce
attach themselves. To go through the different arrangements more in detail =
does
not come within our views, for that would lead us into a boundless field of
particular cases. When a general has laid down for his direction a distinct
point, he will see how far it agrees with geographical, statistical, and
political circumstances, the material and personal relations of his own arm=
y
and that of the enemy, and how the one or the other may require that his pl=
ans
should be modified in carrying them into effect.
</p>

<p>
But in order more distinctly to connect and look closer at the gradations i=
n
the defence specified in the chapter on the different kinds of defence, we
shall here lay before our readers what seems to us most important, in relat=
ion
to the same generally.
</p>

<p>
1. Reasons for marching against the enemy with a view to an offensive battl=
e,
may be as follows:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) If we know that the enemy is advancing with his forces very much
divided, and therefore we have reason to expect a victory, although we are,
upon the whole, much weaker.
</p>

<p>
But such an advance on the part of the assailant is in itself very improbab=
le,
and consequently, unless we know of it upon certain information, the plan i=
s
not good; for to reckon upon it, and rest all our hopes on it through a <i>=
mere
supposition</i>, and without sufficient motive, leads generally to a very
dangerous situation. We do not, then, find things as we expected; we are
obliged to give up the offensive battle, we are not prepared to fight on th=
e
defensive, we are obliged to commence with a retreat against our will, and
leave almost everything to chance.
</p>

<p>
This is very much what occurred in the defence, conducted by the army under
Dohna against the Russians, in the campaign of 1759, and which, under Gener=
al
Wedel, ended in the unfortunate battle of Z=C3=BCllichau.
</p>

<p>
This measure shortens matters so much that plan-makers are only too ready t=
o
propose it, without taking much trouble to inquire how far the hypothesis o=
n
which it rests is well founded.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>) If we are generally in sufficient strength for battle, and=E2=80=
=94
</p>

<p>
(<i>c</i>) If a blundering, irresolute adversary specially invites an attac=
k.
</p>

<p>
In this case the effect of surprise may be worth more than any assistance
furnished by the ground through a good position. It is the real essence of =
good
generalship thus to bring into play the power of the moral forces;=E2=80=94=
but
theory can never say loud enough nor often enough there must be an <i>objec=
tive
foundation</i> for these suppositions; without <i>such foundation</i> to be
always talking of surprises and the superiority of novel or unusual modes o=
f
attack, and thereon to found plans, considerations, criticisms, is acting
without any grounds, and is altogether objectionable.
</p>

<p>
(<i>d</i>) When the nature of our army makes it specially suited for the
offensive.
</p>

<p>
It was certainly not a visionary or false idea when Frederick the Great
conceived that in his mobile, courageous army, full of confidence in him,
obedient by habit, trained to precision, animated and elevated by pride, an=
d
with its perfection in the oblique attack, he possessed an instrument which=
, in
his firm and daring hand, was much more suited to attack than defence; all
these qualities were wanting in his opponents, and in this respect, therefo=
re,
he had the most decided superiority; to make use of this was worth more to =
him,
in most cases, than to take to his assistance entrenchments and obstacles o=
f
ground.=E2=80=94But such a superiority will always be rare; a well-trained =
army,
thoroughly practised in great movements, has only part of the above advanta=
ges.
If Frederick the Great maintained that the Prussian army was particularly
adapted for attack=E2=80=94and this has been incessantly repeated since his
time=E2=80=94still we should not attach too much weight to any such saying;=
 in
most cases in war we feel more exhilarated, more courageous when acting
offensively than defensively: but this is a feeling which all troops have i=
n
common, and there is hardly an army respecting which its generals and leade=
rs
have not made the same assertion (as Frederick). We must, therefore, not to=
o
readily rely on an appearance of superiority, and through that neglect real
advantages.
</p>

<p>
A very natural and weighty reason for resorting to an offensive battle may =
be
the composition of the army as regards the three arms, for instance, a nume=
rous
cavalry and little artillery.
</p>

<p>
We continue the enumeration of reasons.
</p>

<p>
(<i>e</i>) When we can nowhere find a good position.
</p>

<p>
(<i>f</i>) When we must hasten with the decision.
</p>

<p>
(<i>g</i>) Lastly, the combined influence of several or all of these reason=
s.
</p>

<p>
2. The waiting for the enemy in a locality where it is intended to attack h=
im
(Minden, 1759) naturally proceeds from=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>a</i>, there being no such disproportion of force to our disadvantage as=
 to
make it necessary to seek a strong position and strengthen it by entrenchme=
nts.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>, a locality having been found particularly adapted to the purpose.=
 The
properties which determine this belong to tactics; we shall only observe th=
at
these properties chiefly consist in an easy approach for the defender from =
his
side, and in all kinds of obstacles on the side next to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
3. A position will be taken with the express intention of there waiting the
attack of the enemy=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> If the disproportion of forces compels us to seek cover from natu=
ral
obstacles or behind field-works.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> When the country affords an excellent position for our purpose.
</p>

<p>
The two modes of defence, 2 and 3, will come more into consideration accord=
ing
as we do not seek the decision itself, but content ourselves with a negativ=
e
result, and have reason to think that our opponent is wavering and irresolu=
te,
and that he will in the end fail to carry out his plans.
</p>

<p>
4. An entrenched unassailable camp only fulfils the object=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> If it is situated at an extremely important strategic point.
</p>

<p>
The character of such a position consists in this, that we cannot be driven=
 out
of it; the enemy is therefore obliged to try some other means, that is, to
pursue his object without touching this camp, or to blockade it and reduce =
it
by starvation: if it is impossible for him to do this, then the strategic
qualities of the position must be very great.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> If we have reason to expect aid from abroad.
</p>

<p>
Such was the case with the Saxon army in its position at Pirna. Notwithstan=
ding
all that has been said against the measure on account of the ill-success wh=
ich
attended it in this instance, it is perfectly certain that 17,000 Saxons co=
uld
never have been able to neutralise 40,000 Prussians in any other way. If th=
e
Austrians were unable to make better use of the superiority obtained at
Lowositz, that only shows the badness of their whole method of war, as well=
 as
of their whole military organisation; and there cannot be a doubt that if t=
he
Saxons instead of taking post in the camp at Pirna had retired into Bohemia=
,
Frederick the Great would have driven both Austrians and Saxons beyond Prag=
ue,
and taken that place in the same campaign. Whoever does not admit the value=
 of
this advantage, and limits his consideration to the capture of the whole Sa=
xon
army, shows himself incapable of making a calculation of all the circumstan=
ces
in a case of this kind, and without calculation no certain deduction can be
obtained.
</p>

<p>
But as the cases <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> very rarely occur, therefore, the
entrenched camp is a measure which requires to be well considered, and whic=
h is
very seldom suitable in practice. The hope of <i>inspiring</i> the enemy
<i>with respect</i> by such a camp, and thus reducing him to a state of
complete inactivity, is attended with too much danger, namely, with the dan=
ger
of being obliged to fight without the possibility of retreat. If Frederick =
the
Great gained his object in this way at Bunzelwitz, we must admire the corre=
ct
judgment he formed of his adversary, but we must certainly also lay more st=
ress
than usual on the resources which he would have found at the last moment to
clear a road for the remnants of his army, and also on the
<i>irresponsibility</i> of a king.
</p>

<p>
5. If there is one or if there are several fortresses near the frontier, th=
en
the great question arises, whether the defender should seek an action befor=
e or
behind them. The latter recommends itself=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>a</i>, by the superiority of the enemy in numbers, which forces us to br=
eak
his power before coming to a final struggle.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>, by these fortresses being near, so that the sacrifice of territor=
y is
not greater than we are compelled to make.
</p>

<p>
<i>c</i>, by the fitness <i>of the fortresses for defence</i>.
</p>

<p>
One principal use of fortresses is unquestionably, or should be, to break t=
he
enemy=E2=80=99s force in his advance and to weaken considerably that portio=
n
which we intend to bring to an engagement. If we so seldom see this use mad=
e of
fortresses, that proceeds from the cases in which a decisive battle is soug=
ht
for by one of the opposing parties being very rare. But that is the only ki=
nd
of case which we treat of here. We therefore look upon it as a principle
equally simple and important in all cases in which the defender has one or =
more
fortresses near him, that he should keep them before him, and give the deci=
sive
battle behind them. We admit that a battle lost within the line of our
fortresses will compel us to retreat further into the interior of the count=
ry
than one lost on the other side, tactical results in both cases being the s=
ame,
although the causes of the difference have their origin rather in the
imagination than in real things; neither do we forget that a battle may be
given beyond the fortresses in a well chosen position, whilst inside them t=
he
battle in most cases must be an offensive one, particularly if the enemy is
laying siege to a fortress which is in danger of being lost; but what signi=
fy
these nice shades of distinction, as compared to the advantage that, in the
decisive battle, we meet the enemy weakened by a fourth or a third of his
force, perhaps one half if there are many fortresses?
</p>

<p>
We think, therefore, that in all cases of <i>an inevitable decision</i>,
whether sought for by the offensive or the defensive, and that the latter i=
s
not tolerably sure of a victory, or if the nature of the country does not o=
ffer
some most decisive reason to give battle in a position further forward=E2=
=80=94in
all these cases we say when a fortress is situated near at hand and capable=
 of
defence, the defender should by all means withdraw at once behind it, and l=
et
the decision take place on this side, consequently with its co-operation. I=
f he
takes up his position so close to the fortress that the assailant can neith=
er
form the siege of nor blockade the place without first driving him off, he
places the assailant under the necessity of attacking him, the defender, in=
 his
position. To us, therefore, of all defensive measures in a critical situati=
on,
none appears so simple and efficacious as the choice of a good position nea=
r to
and behind a strong fortress.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the question would wear a different aspect if the fortres=
s
was situated far back; for then it would be necessary to abandon a consider=
able
part of our theatre of war, a sacrifice which, as we know, should not be ma=
de
unless in a case of great urgency. In such a case the measure would bear mo=
re
resemblance to a retreat into the interior of the country.
</p>

<p>
Another condition is, the fitness of the place for defence. It is well know=
n
that there are fortified places, especially large ones, which are not fit t=
o be
brought into contact with an enemy=E2=80=99s army, because they could not r=
esist
the sudden assault of a powerful force. In this case, our position must at =
all
events be so close behind that we could support the garrison.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the retreat into the interior of the country is only a natural reso=
urce
under the following circumstances:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>a</i>, when owing to the physical and moral relation in which we stand a=
s
respects the enemy, the idea of a successful resistance on the frontier or =
near
it cannot be entertained.
</p>

<p>
<i>b</i>, when it is a principal object to gain time.
</p>

<p>
<i>c</i>, when there are peculiarities in the country which are favourable =
to
the measure, a subject on which we have already treated in the twenty-fifth
chapter.
</p>

<p>
We thus close the chapter on the defence of a theatre of war if a decisive
solution is sought for by one or other party, and is therefore inevitable. =
But
it must be particularly borne in mind, that events in war do not exhibit
themselves in such a pure abstract form, and that therefore, if our maxims =
and
arguments should be used in reasoning on actual war, our thirtieth chapter
should also be kept in view, and we must suppose the general, in the majori=
ty
of cases, as placed between two tendencies, urged <i>more</i> towards one o=
r
the other, according to circumstances.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap94"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br>Defence of a Theatre of War
(<i>continued</i>)<br>Successive Resistance.</h3>

<p>
We have proved, in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, that in strategy a
successive resistance is inconsistent with the nature of the thing, and tha=
t
all forces available should be used simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
As regards forces which are moveable, this requires no further demonstratio=
n;
but when we look at the seat of war itself, with its fortresses, the natura=
l
divisions of the ground, and even the extent of its surface as being also
elements of war, then, these being immovable, we can only either bring them
gradually into use, or we must at once place ourselves so far back, that al=
l
agencies of this kind which are to be brought into activity are in our fron=
t.
Then everything which can contribute to weaken the enemy in the territory w=
hich
he has occupied, comes at once into activity, for the assailant must at lea=
st
blockade the defender=E2=80=99s fortresses, he must keep the country in
subjection by garrisons and other posts, he has long marches to make, and
everything he requires must be brought from a distance, etc. All these agen=
cies
commence to work, whether the assailant makes <i>his advance before or
after</i> a decision, but in the former case their influence is somewhat
greater. From this, therefore, it follows, that if the defender chooses to
transfer his decision to a point further back, he has thus the means of
bringing at once into play all these immovable elements of military force.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it is clear that this <i>transfer of the solution</i> (o=
n
the part of the defender) does not alter the extent of the influence of a
victory which the assailant gains. In treating of the attack, we shall exam=
ine
more closely the extent of the influence of a victory; here we shall only
observe that it reaches to the exhaustion of the superiority, that is, the
resultant of the physical and moral relations. Now this superiority exhaust=
s
itself in the first place by the duties required from the forces on the the=
atre
of war, and secondly by losses in combats; the diminution of force arising =
from
these two causes cannot be essentially altered, whether the combats take pl=
ace
at the commencement or at the end, near the frontier, or further towards th=
e
interior of the country (vom oder hinten). We think, for example, that a
victory gained by Buonaparte over the Russians at Wilna, 1812, would have
carried him just as far as that of Borodino=E2=80=94assuming that it was eq=
ually
great=E2=80=94and that a victory at Moscow would not have carried him any
further; Moscow was, in either case, the limit of this sphere of victory.
Indeed, it cannot be doubted for a moment that a decisive battle on the
frontier (for other reasons) would have produced much greater results throu=
gh
victory, and then, perhaps, the sphere of its influence would have been wid=
er.
Therefore, in this view, also, the transfer of the decision to a point furt=
her
back is not necessary for the defence.
</p>

<p>
In the chapter on the various means of resistance, that method of delaying =
the
decision, which may be regarded as an extreme form, was brought before us u=
nder
the name of <i>retreat into the interior</i>, and as a particular method of
defence, in which the object is rather that the assailant should wear himse=
lf
out, than that he should be destroyed by the sword on the field of battle. =
But
it is only when such an intention predominates that the delaying of the
decisive battle can be regarded as a <i>peculiar method of resistance;</i> =
for
otherwise it is evident that an infinite number of gradations may be concei=
ved
in this method, and that these may be combined with all other means of defe=
nce.
We therefore look upon the greater or less co-operation of the theatre of w=
ar,
not as a special form of defence, but as nothing more than a discretionary
introduction into the defence of the immovable means of resistance, just
according as circumstances and the nature of the situation may appear to
require.
</p>

<p>
But now, if the defender does not think he requires any assistance from the=
se
immovable forces for his purposed decision, or if the further sacrifice
connected with the use of them is too great, then they are kept in reserve =
for
the future, and form a sort of succession of reinforcements, which perhaps
ensure the possibility of keeping the moveable forces in such a condition t=
hat
they will be able to follow up the first favourable decision with a second,=
 or
perhaps in the same manner even with a third, that is to say, in this manne=
r a
<i>successive</i> application of his forces becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
If the defender loses a battle on the frontier, which does not amount to a
complete defeat, we may very well imagine that, by placing himself behind t=
he
nearest fortress, he will then be in a condition to accept battle again;
indeed, if he is only dealing with an opponent who has not much resolution,
then, perhaps, some considerable obstacle of ground will be quite sufficien=
t as
a means of stopping the enemy.
</p>

<p>
There is, therefore, in strategy, in the use of the theatre of war as well =
as
in everything else, <i>an economy of force;</i> the less one can make suffi=
ce
the better: but there must be sufficient, and here, as well as in commerce,
there is something to be thought of besides mere niggardliness.
</p>

<p>
But in order to prevent a great misconception, we must draw attention to th=
is,
that the subject of our present consideration is not how much resistance an
army can offer, or the enterprises which it can undertake after a lost batt=
le,
but only the result which we can promise ourselves <i>beforehand</i> from t=
his
second act in our defence; consequently, how high we can estimate it in our
plan. Here there is only one point almost which the defender has to look to=
,
which is the character and the situation of his opponent. An adversary weak=
 in
character, with little self-confidence, without noble ambition, placed unde=
r
great restrictions, will content himself, in case he is successful, with a
moderate advantage, and timidly hold back at every fresh offer of a decisio=
n
which the defender ventures to make. In this case the defender may count up=
on
the beneficial use of all the means of resistance of his theatre of war in
succession, in constantly fresh, although in themselves small, combats, in
which the prospect always brightens of an ultimate decision in his favour.
</p>

<p>
But who does not feel that we are now on the road to campaigns devoid of
decision, which are much more the field of a successive application of forc=
e.
Of these we shall speak in the following chapter.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap95"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br>Defence of a Theatre of War
(<i>continued</i>)<br> When no Decision is Sought for.</h3>

<p>
Whether and how far a war is possible in which neither party acts on the
offensive, therefore in which neither combatant has a <i>positive aim</i>, =
we
shall consider in the last book; here it is not necessary for us to occupy
ourselves with the contradiction which this presents, because on a single
theatre of war we can easily suppose reasons for such a defensive on both
sides, consequent on the relations of each of these parts to a whole.
</p>

<p>
But in addition to the examples which history furnishes of particular campa=
igns
that have taken place without the focus of a necessary solution, history al=
so
tells us of many others in which there was no want of an assailant,
consequently no want of a <i>positive will</i> on one side, but in which th=
at
will was so weak that instead of striving to attain the object at any price=
,
and forcing the <i>necessary</i> decision, it contented itself with such
advantages as arose in a manner spontaneously out of circumstances. Or the
assailant pursued <i>no</i> self-selected end <i>at all</i>, but made his
object depend on circumstances, in the meanwhile gathering such fruits as
presented themselves from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Although such an offensive which deviates very much from the strict logical
necessity of a direct march towards the object, and which, almost like a
lounger sauntering through the campaign, looking out right and left for the
cheap fruits of opportunity, differs very little from the defensive itself,
which allows the general to pick up what he can in this way, still we shall
give the closer philosophical consideration of this kind of warfare a place=
 in
the book on the attack. Here we shall confine ourselves to the conclusion t=
hat
in such a campaign the settlement of the whole question is not looked for b=
y
either assailant or defender through a decisive battle, that, therefore, th=
e
great battle is no longer the key-stone of the arch, towards which all the
lines of the strategic superstructure are directed. Campaigns of this kind =
(as
the history of all times and all countries shows us) are not only numerous,=
 but
form such an overwhelming majority, that the remainder only appear as
exceptions. Even if this proportion should alter in the future, still it is
certain that there will always be many such campaigns; and, therefore, in
studying the theory of the defence of a theatre of war, they must be brough=
t
into consideration. We shall endeavour to describe the peculiarities by whi=
ch
they are characterised. Real war will generally be in a medium between the =
two
different tendencies, sometimes approaching nearer to one, sometimes to the
other, and we can, therefore, only see the practical effect of these
peculiarities in the modification which is produced, in the <i>absolute
form</i> of war by their counteraction. We have already said in the third
chapter of this book, that the <i>state of expectation</i> is one of the
greatest advantages which the defensive has over the offensive; as a genera=
l
rule, it seldom happens in life, and least of all in war, that <i>all</i> t=
hat
circumstances would lead us to expect does actually take place. The
imperfection of human insight, the fear of evil results, accidents which
derange the development of designs in their execution, are causes through w=
hich
many of the transactions enjoined by circumstances are never realised in th=
e
execution. In war where insufficiency of knowledge, the danger of a
catastrophe, the number of accidents are incomparably greater than in any o=
ther
branch of human activity, the number of shortcomings, if we may so call the=
m,
must necessarily also be much greater. This is then the rich field where th=
e
defensive gathers fruits which grow for it spontaneously. If we add to this
result of experience the substantial importance of the possession of the
surface of the ground in war, then that maxim which has become a proverb,
<i>beati sunt possidentes</i>, holds good here as well as in peace. It is
<i>this maxim</i> which here takes the place of the decision, that focus of=
 all
action in every war directed to <i>mutual destruction</i>. It is fruitful
beyond measure, not in actions which it calls forth, but in motives for not
acting, and for all that action which is done in the interest of inaction. =
When
no decision is to be sought for or expected, there is no reason for giving =
up
anything, for that could only be done to gain thereby some advantage in the
decision. The consequence is that the defender keeps all, or at least as mu=
ch
as he can (that is as much as he can cover), and the assailant takes posses=
sion
of so much as he can without involving himself in a decision, (that is, he =
will
extend himself laterally as much as possible). We have only to deal with th=
e
first in this place.
</p>

<p>
Wherever the defender is not present with his military forces, the assailan=
t
can take possession, and then the advantage of the state of expectation is =
on
<i>his side;</i> hence the endeavour to cover the country everywhere direct=
ly,
and to take the chance of the assailant attacking the troops posted for thi=
s
purpose.
</p>

<p>
Before we go further into the special properties of the defence, we must
extract from the book on the attack those objects which the assailant usual=
ly
aims at when the decision (by battle) is not sought. They are as
follows:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. The seizure of a considerable strip of territory, as far as that can be =
done
without a decisive engagement.
</p>

<p>
2. The capture of an important magazine under the same condition.
</p>

<p>
3. The capture of a fortress not covered. No doubt a siege is more or less =
a
great operation, often requiring great labour; but it is an undertaking whi=
ch
does not contain the elements of a catastrophe. If it comes to the worst, t=
he
siege can be raised without thereby suffering a great positive loss.
</p>

<p>
4. Lastly, a successful combat of some importance, but in which there is no=
t
much risked, and consequently not much to be gained; a combat which takes p=
lace
not as the cardinal knot of a whole strategic bond, but on its own account =
for
the sake of trophies or honour of the troops. For such an object, of course=
, a
combat is not fought <i>at any price;</i> we either wait for the chance of =
a
favourable opportunity, or seek to bring one about by skill.
</p>

<p>
These four objects of attack give rise to the following efforts on the part=
 of
the defence:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. To cover the fortresses by keeping them behind us.
</p>

<p>
2. To cover the country by extending the troops over it.
</p>

<p>
3. Where the extension is not sufficient, to throw the army rapidly in fron=
t of
the enemy by a flank march.
</p>

<p>
4. To guard against disadvantageous combats.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that the object of the first three measures is to force on the
enemy the initiative, and to derive the utmost advantage from the state of
expectation, and this object is so deeply rooted in the nature of the thing
that it would be great folly to despise it <i>prima facie</i>. It must
necessarily occupy a higher place the less a decision is expected, and it i=
s
the ruling principle in all such campaigns, even although, apparently, a
considerable degree of activity may be manifested in small actions of an
indecisive character.
</p>

<p>
Hannibal as well as Fabius, and both Frederick the Great and Daun, have don=
e
homage to this principle whenever they did not either seek for or expect a
decision. The fourth effort serves as a corrective to the three others, it =
is
their conditio <i>sine qu=C3=A2 non</i>.
</p>

<p>
We shall now proceed to examine these subjects a little more closely.
</p>

<p>
At first sight it appears somewhat preposterous to protect a fortress from =
the
enemy=E2=80=99s attack by placing an army in <i>front of it;</i> such a mea=
sure
looks like a kind of pleonasm, as fortifications are built to resist a host=
ile
attack of themselves. Yet it is a measure which we see resorted to thousand=
s
and thousands of times. But thus it is in the conduct of war; the most comm=
on
things often seem the most incomprehensible. Who would presume to pronounce
these thousands of instances to be so many blunders on the ground of this
seeming inconsistency? The constant repetition of the measure shows that it
must proceed from some deep-seated motive. This reason is, however, no othe=
r
than that pointed out above, emanating from moral sluggishness and inactivi=
ty.
</p>

<p>
If the defender places himself in front of his fortress, the enemy cannot
attack it unless he first beats the army in front of it; but a battle is a
decision; if that is <i>not</i> the enemy=E2=80=99s object then there will =
be no
battle, and the defender will remain in possession of his fortress without
striking a blow; consequently, whenever we do not believe the enemy intends=
 to
fight a battle, we should venture on the chance of his not making up his mi=
nd
to do so, especially as in most cases we still retain the power of withdraw=
ing
behind the fortress in a moment, if, contrary to our expectation, the enemy
should march to attack us; the position before the fortress is in this way =
free
from danger, and the probability of maintaining the <i>status quo</i> witho=
ut
any sacrifice, is not even attended with the <i>slightest</i> risk.
</p>

<p>
If the defender places himself behind the fortress, he offers the assailant=
 an
object which is exactly suited to the circumstances in which the latter is
placed. If the fortress is not of great strength, and he is not quite
unprepared, he will commence the siege: in order that this may not end in t=
he
fall of the place, the defender must march to its relief. The positive acti=
on,
the initiative, is now laid on him, and the adversary who by his siege is t=
o be
regarded as advancing towards his object, is in the situation of occupier.
</p>

<p>
Experience teaches that the matter always takes this turn, and it does so
naturally. A catastrophe, as we have before said, is not necessarily bound =
up
with a siege. Even a general, devoid of either the spirit of enterprise or
energy, who would never make up his mind to a battle, will proceed to under=
take
a siege with perhaps nothing but field artillery, when he can approach a
fortress without risk. At the worst he can abandon his undertaking without =
any
positive loss. There always remains to be considered the danger to which mo=
st
fortresses are more or less exposed, that of being taken by assault, or in =
some
other irregular manner, and this circumstance should certainly not be
overlooked by the defender in his calculation of probabilities.
</p>

<p>
In weighing and considering the different chances, it seems natural that th=
e
defender should look upon the probability of not having to fight at all as =
more
for his advantage than the probability of fighting even under <i>favourable
circumstances</i>. And thus it appears to us that the practice of placing a=
n
army in the field before its fortress, is both natural and fully explained.
Frederick the Great, for instance, at Glogau, against the Russians, at
Schwednitz, Neiss, and Dresden, against the Austrians, almost always adopte=
d
it. This measure, however, brought misfortune on the Duke of Bevern at Bres=
lau;
<i>behind</i> Breslau he could not have been attacked; the superiority of t=
he
Austrians in the king=E2=80=99s absence would soon cease, as he was approac=
hing;
and therefore, by a position <i>behind</i> Breslau, a battle might have bee=
n
avoided until Frederick=E2=80=99s arrival. No doubt the Duke would have pre=
ferred
that course if it had not been that it would have exposed that important pl=
ace
to a bombardment, at which the king, who was anything but tolerant on such
occasions, would have been highly displeased. <i>The attempt made</i> by th=
e
Duke to protect Breslau by an entrenched position taken up for the purpose,
cannot after all be disapproved, for it was very possible that Prince Charl=
es
of Lorraine, contented with the capture of Schwednitz, and threatened by th=
e
march of the king, would, by that position, have been prevented from advanc=
ing
farther. The best thing he could have done would have been to refuse the ba=
ttle
at the last by withdrawing through Breslau at the moment that the Austrians
advanced to the attack; in this way he would have got all the advantages of=
 the
state of expectation without paying for them by a great danger.
</p>

<p>
If we have here traced the position <i>before</i> a fortress to reasons of =
a
superior and absolute order, and defended its adoption on those grounds, we
have still to observe that there is a motive of a secondary class which, th=
ough
a more obvious one, is not sufficient of itself alone, not being absolute; =
we
refer to the use which is made by armies of the nearest fortress as a dep=
=C3=B4t of
provisions and munitions of war. This is so convenient, and presents so man=
y
advantages, that a general will not easily make up his mind to draw his
supplies of all kinds from more distant places, or to lodge them in open to=
wns.
But if a fortress is the great magazine of an army, then the position befor=
e it
is frequently a matter of absolute necessity, and in most cases is very
natural. But it is easy to see that this obvious motive, which is easily
over-valued by those who are not in the habit of looking far before them, i=
s
neither sufficient to explain all cases, nor are the circumstances connecte=
d
with it of sufficient importance to entitle it to give a final decision.
</p>

<p>
The capture of one or more fortresses without risking a battle, is such a v=
ery
natural object of all attacks which do not aim at a decision on the field o=
f
battle, that the defender makes it his principal business to thwart this
design. Thus it is that on theatres of war, containing a number of fortress=
es,
we find these places made the pivots of almost all the movements; we find t=
he
assailant seeking to approach one of them unexpectedly, and employing vario=
us
feints to aid his purpose, and the defender immediately seeking to stop him=
 by
well-prepared movements. Such is the general character of almost all the
campaigns of Louis XIV. in the Netherlands up to the time of Marshal Saxe.
</p>

<p>
So much for the covering of fortresses.
</p>

<p>
The covering of a country by an extended disposition of forces, is only
conceivable in combination with very considerable obstacles of ground. The
great and small posts which must be formed for the purpose, can only get a
certain capability of resistance through strength of position; and as natur=
al
obstacles are seldom found sufficient, therefore field fortification is mad=
e
use of as an assistance. But now it is to be observed that, the power of
resistance which is thus obtained at any one point, is always only
<i>relative</i> (see the chapter on the signification of the combat), and n=
ever
to be regarded as <i>absolute</i>. It may certainly happen that one such po=
st
may remain proof against all attacks made upon it, and that therefore in a
single instance there may be an absolute result; but from the great number =
of
posts, any single one, in comparison to the whole, appears weak, and expose=
d to
the possible attack of an overwhelming force, and consequently it would be
unreasonable to place one=E2=80=99s dependence for safety on the resistance=
 of
any one single post. In such an extended position, we can therefore only co=
unt
on a resistance of relative length, and not upon a victory, properly speaki=
ng.
This value of single posts, at the same time, is also sufficient for the
object, and for a general calculation. In campaigns in which no great decis=
ion,
no irresistible march, towards the complete subjugation of the whole force =
is
to be feared, there is little risk in a combat of posts, even if it ends in=
 the
loss of a post. There is seldom any further result in connection with it th=
an
the loss of the post and a few trophies; the influence of victory penetrate=
s no
further into the situation of affairs, it does not tear down any part of th=
e
foundation to be followed by a mass of building in ruin. In the worst case,=
 if,
for instance, the whole defensive system is disorganised by the loss of a
single post, the defender has always time to concentrate his corps, and wit=
h
his whole force to <i>offer battle</i>, which the assailant, according to o=
ur
supposition, does not desire. Therefore also it usually happens that with t=
his
concentration of force the act closes, and the further advance of the assai=
lant
is stopped. A strip of land, a few men and guns, are the losses of the
defender, and with these results the assailant is satisfied.
</p>

<p>
To such a risk we say the defender may very well expose himself, if he has,=
 on
the other hand, the possibility, or rather the probability, in his favour, =
that
the assailant from excessive caution will halt before his posts without
attacking them. Only in regard to this we must not lose sight of the fact, =
that
we are now supposing an assailant who will not venture upon any great strok=
e, a
moderate sized, but strong post will very well serve to stop such an advers=
ary,
for although he can undoubtedly make himself master of it, still the questi=
on
arises as to the price it will cost, and whether that price is not too high=
 for
any use that he can make of the victory.
</p>

<p>
In this way we may see how the powerful relative resistance which the defen=
der
can obtain from an extended disposition, consisting of a number of posts in
juxtaposition with each other, may constitute a satisfactory result in the
calculation of his whole campaign. In order to direct at once to the right
point the glance which the reader, with his mind=E2=80=99s eye, will here c=
ast
upon military history, we must observe that these extended positions appear
most frequently in the latter half of a campaign, because by that time the
defender has become thoroughly acquainted with his adversary, with his
projects, and his situation; and the little quantity of the spirit of
enterprise with which the assailant started, is usually exhausted.
</p>

<p>
In this defensive, in an extended position by which the <i>country</i>, the
<i>supplies</i>, the <i>fortresses</i> are to be covered, all great natural
obstacles, such as streams, rivers, mountains, woods, morasses, must natura=
lly
play a great part, and acquire a predominant importance. Upon their use we
refer to what has been already said on these subjects.
</p>

<p>
It is through this predominant importance of the topographical element that=
 the
knowledge and activity which are looked upon as the speciality of the gener=
al
staff of an army are more particularly called into requisition. Now, as the
staff of the army is usually that branch which writes and publishes most, i=
t
follows that these parts of campaigns are recorded more fully in history; a=
nd
then again from that there follows a not unnatural tendency to systematise
them, and to frame out of the historical solution of one case a general
solution for all succeeding cases. But this endeavour is futile, and theref=
ore
erroneous. Besides, in this more passive kind of war, in this form of it wh=
ich
is tied to localities, each case is different to another, and must be
differently treated. The ablest memoirs of a critical character respecting
these subjects are therefore only suited to make one acquainted with facts,=
 but
never to serve as dictates.
</p>

<p>
Natural, and at the same time meritorious, as is this industry which, accor=
ding
to the general view, we have attributed to the staff in particular, still w=
e
must raise a warning voice against usurpations which often spring from it t=
o
the prejudice of the whole. The authority acquired by those who are at the =
head
of, and best acquainted with, this branch of military service, gives them o=
ften
a sort of general dominion over people=E2=80=99s minds, beginning with the
general himself, and from this then springs a routine of ideas which causes=
 an
undue bias of the mind. At last the general sees nothing but mountains and
passes, and that which should be a measure of free choice guided by
circumstances becomes mannerism, becomes second nature.
</p>

<p>
Thus in the year 1793 and 1794, Colonel Grawert of the Prussian army, who w=
as
the animating spirit of the staff at that time, and well known as a regular=
 man
for mountains and passes, persuaded two generals of the most opposite perso=
nal
characteristics, the Duke of Brunswick and General Mollendorf, into exactly=
 the
same method of carrying on war.
</p>

<p>
That a defensive line parallel to the course of a formidable natural obstac=
le
may lead to a cordon war is quite plain. It must, in most cases, necessaril=
y
lead to that if really the whole extent of the theatre of war could be dire=
ctly
covered in that manner. But most theatres of war have such an extent, that =
the
normal tactical disposition of the troops destined for its defence would be=
 by
no means commensurate with that object; at the same time as the assailant, =
by
his own dispositions and other circumstances, is confined to certain princi=
pal
directions and great roads, and any great deviations from these directions,
even if he is only opposed to a very inactive defender, would be attended w=
ith
great embarrassment and disadvantage, therefore generally all that the defe=
nder
has to do is to cover the country for a certain number of miles or marches
right and left of these principal lines of direction of his adversary. But
again to effect this covering, we may be contented with defensive posts on =
the
principal roads and means of approach, and merely watch the country between=
 by
small posts of observation. The consequence of this is certainly that the
assailant may then pass a column between two of these posts, and thus make =
the
attack, which he has in view, upon one post from several quarters at once. =
Now,
these posts are in some measure arranged to meet this, partly by their havi=
ng
supports for their flanks, partly by the formation of flank defences (calle=
d
crochets), partly by their being able to receive assistance from a reserve
posted in rear, or by troops detached from adjoining posts. In this manner =
the
number of posts is reduced still more, and the result is that an army engag=
ed
in a defence of this kind, usually divides itself into four or five princip=
al
posts.
</p>

<p>
For important points of approach, beyond a certain distance, and yet in som=
e
measure threatened, special central points are established which, in a cert=
ain
measure, form small theatres of war within the principal one. In this manne=
r
the Austrians, during the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, generally placed the ma=
in
body of their army, in four or five posts in the mountains of Lower Silesia=
;
whilst a small almost independent corps organised for itself a similar syst=
em
of defence in Upper Silesia.
</p>

<p>
Now, the further such a defensive system diverges from direct covering, the
more it must call to its assistance=E2=80=94mobility (active defence), and =
even
offensive means. Certain corps are considered reserves; besides which, one =
post
hastens to send to the help of another all the troops it can spare. This
assistance may be rendered either by hastening up directly from the rear to
reinforce and re-establish the passive defence, or by attacking the enemy i=
n
flank, or even by menacing his line of retreat. If the assailant threatens =
the
flank of a post not with direct attack, but only by a position through whic=
h he
can act upon the communications of this post, then either the corps which h=
as
been advanced for this purpose must be attacked in earnest, or the way of
reprisal must be resorted to by acting in turn on the enemy=E2=80=99s
communications.
</p>

<p>
We see, therefore, that however passive this defence is in the leading idea=
s on
which it is based, still it must comprise many active means, and in its
organisation may be forearmed in many ways against complicated events. Usua=
lly
those defences pass for the best which make the most use of active or even
offensive means; but this depends in great part on the nature of the countr=
y,
the characteristics of the troops, and even on the talent of the general;
partly we are also very prone in general to expect too much from movement, =
and
other auxiliary measures of an active nature, and to place too little relia=
nce
on the local defence of a formidable natural obstacle. We think we have thu=
s
sufficiently explained what we understand by an extended line of defence, a=
nd
we now turn to the third auxiliary means, the placing ourselves in front of=
 the
enemy by a rapid march to a flank.
</p>

<p>
This means is necessarily one of those provided for that defence of a count=
ry
which we are now considering. In the first place the defender, even with th=
e
most extended position, often cannot guard all the approaches to his countr=
y
which are menaced; next, in many cases, he must be ready to repair with the
bulk of his forces to any posts upon which the bulk of the enemy=E2=80=99s =
force
is about to be thrown, as otherwise those posts would be too easily
overpowered; lastly, a general who has an aversion to confining his army to=
 a
passive resistance in an extended position, must seek to attain his object,=
 the
protection of the country, by rapid, well-planned, and well-conducted
movements. The greater the spaces which he leaves exposed, the greater the
talent required in planning the movements, in order to arrive anywhere at t=
he
right moment of time.
</p>

<p>
The natural consequence of striving to do this is, that in such a case,
positions which afford sufficient advantages to make an enemy give up all i=
dea
of an attack as soon as our army, or only a portion of it, reaches them, ar=
e
sought for and prepared in all directions. As these positions are again and
again occupied, and all depends on reaching the same in right time, they ar=
e in
a certain measure the vowels of all this method of carrying on war, which o=
n
that account has been termed a <i>war of posts</i>.
</p>

<p>
Just as an extended position, and the relative resistance in a war <i>witho=
ut
great decisions</i>, do not present the dangers which are inherent in its
original nature, so in the same manner the intercepting the enemy in front =
by a
march to a flank is not so hazardous as it would be in the immediate
expectation of a great decision. To attempt at the last moment in greatest
haste (by a lateral movement) to thrust in an army in front of an adversary=
 of
determined character, who is both able and willing to deal heavy blows, and=
 has
no scruples about an expenditure of forces, would be half way to a most
decisive disaster; for against an unhesitating blow delivered with the
enemy=E2=80=99s whole strength, such running and stumbling into a position =
would
not do. But against an opponent who, instead of taking up his work with his
whole hand, uses only the tips of his fingers, who does not know how to mak=
e
use of a great result, or rather of the opening for one, who only seeks a
trifling advantage but at small expense, against such an opponent this kind=
 of
resistance certainly may be applied with effect.
</p>

<p>
A natural consequence is, that this means also in general occurs oftener in=
 the
last half of a campaign than at its commencement.
</p>

<p>
Here, also, the general staff has an opportunity of displaying its
topographical knowledge in framing a system of combined measures, connected
with the choice and preparation of the positions and the roads leading to t=
hem.
</p>

<p>
When the whole object of one party is to gain in the end a certain point, a=
nd
the whole object of his adversary, on the other hand, is to prevent his doi=
ng
so, then both parties are often obliged to make their movements under the e=
yes
of each other; for this reason, these movements must be made with a degree =
of
precaution and precision not otherwise required. Formerly, before the mass =
of
an army was formed of independent divisions, and even on the march was alwa=
ys
regarded as an indivisible whole, this precaution and precision was attende=
d
with much more formality, and with the copious use of tactical skill. On th=
ese
occasions, certainly, single brigades were often obliged to leave the gener=
al
line of battle to secure particular points, and act an independent part unt=
il
the army arrived: but these were, and continued, <i>anomalous proceedings;<=
/i>
and the aim in the order of march generally was to move the army from one p=
oint
to another as a whole, preserving its normal formation, and avoiding such
exceptional proceedings as the above as far as possible. Now that the parts=
 of
the main body of an army are subdivided again into independent bodies, and
those bodies can venture to enter into an engagement with the mass of the
enemy=E2=80=99s army, provided the rest of the force of which it is a membe=
r is
sufficiently near to carry it on and finish it,=E2=80=94now such a flank ma=
rch is
attended with less difficulty even under the eye of the enemy. What formerl=
y
could only be effected through the actual mechanism of the order of march, =
can
now be done by starting single divisions at an earlier hour, by hastening t=
he
march of others, and by the greater freedom in the employment of the whole.
</p>

<p>
By the means of defence just considered, the assailant can be prevented fro=
m
taking any fortress, from occupying any important extent of country, or
capturing magazines; and he will be prevented, if in every direction combat=
s
are offered to him in which he can see little probability of success, or to=
o
great danger of a reaction in case of failure, or in general, an expenditur=
e of
force too great for his object and existing relations.
</p>

<p>
If now the defender succeeds in this triumph of his art and skill, and the
assailant, wherever he turns his eyes, sees prudent preparations through wh=
ich
he is cut off from any prospect of attaining his modest wishes: then the
offensive principle often seeks to escape from the difficulty in the
satisfaction of the mere honour of its arms. The gain of some combat of
respectable importance, gives the arms of the victor a semblance of
superiority, appeases the vanity of the general, of the court, of the army,=
 and
the people, and thus satisfies, to a certain extent, the expectations which=
 are
naturally always raised when the offensive is assumed.
</p>

<p>
An advantageous combat of some importance merely for the sake of the victor=
y
and some trophies, becomes, therefore, the last hope of the assailant. No o=
ne
must suppose that we here involve ourselves in a contradiction, for we cont=
end
that we still continue within our <i>own supposition</i>, that the good
measures of the defender have deprived the assailant of all expectation of
attaining any one of those other objects by means of a <i>successful
combat!</i> To warrant that expectation, two conditions are required, that =
is,
a <i>favourable termination to the combat</i>, and next, <i>that the result
shall lead really to the attainment of one of those objects</i>.
</p>

<p>
The first may very well take place without the second, and therefore the
defenders=E2=80=99 corps and posts singly are much more frequently in dange=
r of
getting involved in disadvantageous combats if the assailant merely aims at=
 the
<i>honour of the battle field</i>, than if he connects with that a view to
further advantages as well.
</p>

<p>
If we place ourselves in Daun=E2=80=99s situation, and with his way of thin=
king,
then his venturing on the surprise of Hochkirch does not appear inconsisten=
t
with his character, as long as we suppose him aiming at nothing more than t=
he
trophies of the day. But a victory rich in results, which would have compel=
led
the king to abandon Dresden and Neisse, appears an entirely different probl=
em,
one with which he would not have been inclined to meddle.
</p>

<p>
Let it not be imagined that these are trifling or idle distinctions; we hav=
e,
on the contrary, now before us one of the deepest-rooted, leading principle=
s of
war. The signification of a combat is its very soul in strategy, and we can=
not
too often repeat, that in strategy the leading events always proceed from t=
he
ultimate views of the two parties, as it were, from a conclusion of the who=
le
train of ideas. This is why there may be such a difference strategically
between one battle and another, that they can hardly be looked upon as the =
same
means.
</p>

<p>
Now, although the fruitless victory of the assailant can hardly be consider=
ed
any serious injury to the defence, still as the defender will not willingly
concede even <i>this</i> advantage, particularly as we never know what acci=
dent
may also be connected with it, therefore the defender requires to keep an
incessant watch upon the situation of all his corps and posts. No doubt her=
e
all greatly depends on the leaders of those corps making suitable dispositi=
ons;
but any one of them may be led into an unavoidable catastrophe by injudicio=
us
orders imposed on him by the general-in-chief. Who is not reminded here of
Fouqu=C3=A9=E2=80=99s corps at Landshut and of Fink=E2=80=99s at Maxen?
</p>

<p>
In both cases Frederick the Great reckoned too much on customary ideas. It =
was
impossible that he could suppose 10,000 men capable of successfully resisti=
ng
30,000 in the position of Landshut, or that Fink could resist a superior fo=
rce
pouring in and overwhelming him on all sides; but he thought the strength o=
f
the position of Landshut would be accepted, like a bill of exchange, as
heretofore, and that Daun would see in the demonstration against his flank
sufficient reason to exchange his uncomfortable position in Saxony for the =
more
comfortable one in Bohemia. He misjudged Laudon in one case and Daun in the
other, and therein lies the error in these measures.
</p>

<p>
But irrespective of such errors, into which even generals may fall who are =
not
so proud, daring, and obstinate as Frederick the Great in some of his
proceedings may certainly be termed, there is always, in respect to the sub=
ject
we are now considering, a great difficulty in this way, that the
general-in-chief cannot always expect all he desires from the sagacity,
good-will, courage and firmness of character of his corps-commanders. He
cannot, therefore, leave everything to their good judgment; he must prescri=
be
rules on many points by which their course of action, being restricted, may
easily become inconsistent with the circumstances of the moment. This is,
however, an unavoidable inconvenience. Without an imperious commanding will=
,
the influence of which penetrates through the whole army, war cannot be wel=
l
conducted; and whoever would follow the practice of always expecting the be=
st
from his subordinates, would from that very reason be quite unfit for a goo=
d
Commander of an army.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the situation of every corps and post must be for ever kept clear=
ly
in view, to prevent any of them being unexpectedly drawn into a catastrophe=
.
</p>

<p>
The aim of all these efforts is to preserve the <i>status quo</i>. The more
fortunate and successful these efforts are, the longer will the war last at=
 the
same point; but the longer war continues at one point, the greater become t=
he
cares for subsistence.
</p>

<p>
In place of collections and contributions from the country, a system of
subsistence from magazines commences at once, or in a very short time; in p=
lace
of country waggons being collected upon each occasion, the formation, more =
or
less, of a regular transport takes place, composed either of carriages of t=
he
country, or of those belonging to the army; in short, there arises an appro=
ach
to that regular system of feeding troops from magazines, of which we have
already treated in the fourteenth chapter (On Subsistence).
</p>

<p>
At the same time, it is not this which exercises a great influence on this =
mode
of conducting war, for as this mode, by its object and character, is in fac=
t
already tied down to a limited space, therefore the question of subsistence=
 may
very well have a part in determining its action=E2=80=94and will do so in m=
ost
cases=E2=80=94without altering the general character of the war. On the oth=
er
hand, the action of the belligerents mutually against the lines of
communications gains a much greater importance for two reasons. Firstly,
because in such campaigns, there being no measures of a great and comprehen=
sive
kind, generals must apply their energies to those of an inferior order; and
secondly, because here there is time enough to wait for the effect of this
means. The security of his line of communications is therefore specially
important to the defender, for although it is true that its interruption ca=
nnot
be an object of the hostile operations which take place, yet it might compe=
l
him to retreat, and thus to leave other objects open to attack.
</p>

<p>
All the measures having for their object the protection of the area of the
theatre of war itself, must naturally also have the effect of covering the
lines of communication; their security is therefore in part provided for in
that way, and we have only to observe that it is a principal condition in
fixing upon a position.
</p>

<p>
A <i>special</i> means of security consists in the bodies of troops, both s=
mall
and large, escorting convoys. First, the most extended positions are not
sufficient to secure the lines of communication, and next, such an escort i=
s
particularly necessary when the general wishes to avoid a very extended
position. Therefore, we find, in Tempelhof=E2=80=99s History of the Seven
Years=E2=80=99 War, instances without end in which Frederick the Great caus=
ed his
bread and flour waggons to be escorted by single regiments of infantry or
cavalry, sometimes also by whole brigades. On the Austrian side we nowhere =
find
mention of the same thing, which certainly may be partly accounted for in t=
his
way, that they had no such circumstantial historian on their side, but in p=
art
it is also to be ascribed just to this, that they always took up much more
extended positions.
</p>

<p>
Having now touched upon the four efforts which form the foundation of a
defensive <i>that does not aim at a decision</i>, and which are at the same
time, altogether free upon the whole from all offensive elements, we must n=
ow
say something of the offensive means with which they may become more or les=
s
mixed up, in a certain measure flavoured. These offensive means are
chiefly:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. Operating against the enemy=E2=80=99s communications, under which we lik=
ewise
include enterprises against his places of supply.
</p>

<p>
2. Diversions and incursions within the enemy=E2=80=99s territory.
</p>

<p>
3. Attacks on the enemy=E2=80=99s corps and posts, and even upon his main b=
ody,
under favourable circumstances, or the threat only of such intention.
</p>

<p>
The first of these means is incessantly in action in all campaigns of this
kind, but in a certain measure quite quietly without actually making its
appearance. Every suitable position for the defender derives a great part o=
f
its efficacy from the disquietude which it causes the assailant in connecti=
on
with his communications; and as the question of subsistence in such warfare
becomes, as we have already observed, one of vital importance, affecting th=
e
assailant equally, therefore, through this apprehension of offensive action=
,
possibly resulting from the enemy=E2=80=99s position, a great part of the
strategic web is determined, as we shall again find in treating of the atta=
ck.
</p>

<p>
Not only this general influence, proceeding from the choice of positions,
which, like pressure in mechanics, produces an effect <i>invisibly</i>, but
also an actual offensive movement with part of the army against the
enemy=E2=80=99s lines of communication, comes within the compass of such a
defensive. But that it may be done with effect, <i>the situation of the lin=
es
of communication, the nature of the country, and the peculiar qualities of =
the
troops</i> must be specially propitious to the undertaking.
</p>

<p>
Incursions into the enemy=E2=80=99s country which have as their object repr=
isals
or levying contributions, cannot properly be regarded as defensive means, t=
hey
are rather true offensive means; but they are usually combined with the obj=
ect
of a real diversion, which may be regarded as a real defensive measure, as =
it
is intended to weaken the enemy=E2=80=99s force opposed to us. But as the a=
bove
means may be used just as well by the assailant, and in itself is a real
attack, we therefore think more suitable to leave its further examination f=
or
the next book. Accordingly we shall only count it in here, in order to rend=
er a
full account of the arsenal of small offensive arms belonging to the defend=
er
of a theatre of war, and for the present merely add that in extent and
importance it may attain to such a point, as to give the whole war the
<i>appearance</i>, and along with that the honour, of the offensive. Of thi=
s
nature are Frederick the Great=E2=80=99s enterprises in Poland, Bohemia and
Franconia, before the campaign of 1759. His campaign itself is plainly a pu=
re
defence; these incursions into the enemy=E2=80=99s territory, however, gave=
 it
the appearance of an aggression, which perhaps had a special value on accou=
nt
of the moral effect.
</p>

<p>
An attack on one of the enemy=E2=80=99s corps or on his main body must alwa=
ys be
kept in view as a necessary complement of the whole defence whenever the
aggressor takes the matter too easily, and on that account shows himself ve=
ry
defenceless at particular points. Under this silent condition the whole act=
ion
takes place. But here also the defender, in the same way as in operating
against the communications of the enemy, may go a step further in the provi=
nce
of the offensive, and just as well as his adversary may make it his busines=
s to
lie in wait <i>for a favourable stroke</i>. In order to ensure a result in =
this
field, he must either be very decidedly superior in force to his
opponent=E2=80=94which certainly is inconsistent with the defensive in gene=
ral,
but still may happen=E2=80=94or he must have a method and the talent of kee=
ping
his forces more concentrated, and make up by activity and mobility for the
danger which he incurs in other respects.
</p>

<p>
The first was Daun=E2=80=99s case in the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War; the latt=
er, the
case of Frederick the Great. Still we hardly ever see Daun=E2=80=99s offens=
ive
make its appearance except when Frederick the Great invited it by excessive
boldness and a display of contempt for him (Hochkirch, Maxen, Landshut). On=
 the
other hand, we see Frederick the Great almost constantly on the move in ord=
er
to beat one or other of Daun=E2=80=99s corps with his main body. He certain=
ly
seldom succeeded, at least, the results were never great, because Daun, in
addition to his great superiority in numbers, had also a rare degree of
prudence and caution; but we must not suppose that, therefore, the king=E2=
=80=99s
attempts were altogether fruitless. In these attempts lay rather a very
effectual resistance; for the care and fatigue, which his adversary had to
undergo in order to avoid fighting at a disadvantage, neutralised those for=
ces
which would otherwise have aided in advancing the offensive action. Let us =
only
call to mind the campaign of 1760, in Silesia, where Daun and the Russians,=
 out
of sheer apprehension of being attacked and beaten by the king, first here =
and
then there, never could succeed in making one step in advance.
</p>

<p>
We believe we have now gone through all the subjects which form the predomi=
nant
ideas, the principal aims, and therefore the main stay, of the whole action=
 in
the defence of a theatre of war when no idea of decision is entertained. Ou=
r
chief, and, indeed, sole object in bringing them all close together, was to=
 let
the organism of the whole strategic action be seen in one view; the particu=
lar
measures by means of which those subjects come to life, marches, positions,
etc., etc., we have already considered in detail.
</p>

<p>
By now casting a glance once more at the whole of our subject, the idea mus=
t
strike us forcibly, that with such a weak offensive principle, with so litt=
le
desire for a decision on either side, with so little positive motive, with =
so
many counteracting influences of a subjective nature, which stop us and hol=
d us
back, the essential difference between attack and defence must always tend =
more
to disappear. At the opening of a campaign, certainly one party will enter =
the
other=E2=80=99s theatre of war, and in that manner, to a certain extent, su=
ch
party puts on the form of offensive. But it may very well take place, and
happens frequently that he must soon enough apply all his powers to defend =
his
own country on the enemy=E2=80=99s territory. Then both stand, in reality,
opposite one another in a state of mutual observation. Both intent on losin=
g
nothing, perhaps both alike intent also on obtaining a positive advantage.
Indeed it may happen, as with Frederick the Great, that the real defender a=
ims
higher in that way than his adversary.
</p>

<p>
Now the more the assailant gives up the position of an enemy making progres=
s,
the less the defender is menaced by him, and confined to a strictly defensi=
ve
attitude by the pressing claims of a regard for mere safety, so much the mo=
re a
similarity in the relations of the parties is produced in which then the
activity of both will be directed towards gaining an advantage over his
opponent, and protecting himself against any disadvantage, therefore to a t=
rue
strategic <i>man=C5=93uvring;</i> and indeed this is the character into whi=
ch all
campaigns resolve themselves more or less, when the situation of the combat=
ants
or political views do not allow of any great decision.
</p>

<p>
In the following book we have allotted a chapter specially to the subject o=
f
strategic man=C5=93uvres; but as this equipoised play of forces has frequen=
tly been
invested in theory with an importance to which it is not entitled, we find
ourselves under the necessity of examining the subject more closely while w=
e
are treating of the defence, as it is in that form of warfare more particul=
arly
that this false importance is ascribed to strategic man=C5=93uvres.
</p>

<p>
We call it an <i>equipoised play of forces</i>, for when there is no moveme=
nt
of the whole body there is a state of equilibrium; where no great object
impels, there is no movement of the whole; therefore, in such a case, the t=
wo
parties, however unequal they may be, are still to be regarded as in a stat=
e of
equilibrium. From this state of equilibrium of the whole now come forth the
particular motives to actions of a minor class and secondary objects. They =
can
here develop themselves, because they are no longer kept down by the pressu=
re
of a great decision and great danger. Therefore, what can be lost or won up=
on
the whole is changed into small counters, and the action of the war, as a
whole, is broken up into smaller transactions. With these smaller operation=
s
for smaller gains, a contest of skill now takes place between the two gener=
als;
but as it is impossible in war to shut out chance, and consequently good lu=
ck,
therefore this contest will never be otherwise than a <i>game</i>. In the
meantime, here arise two other questions, that is, whether in this man=C5=
=93uvring,
chance will not have a smaller, and superior intelligence a greater, share =
in
the decision, than where all concentrates itself into one single great act.=
 The
last of these questions we must answer in the affirmative. The more complet=
e
the organisation of the whole, the oftener time and space come into
consideration=E2=80=94the former by single moments, the latter at particula=
r
points=E2=80=94so much the greater, plainly, will be the field for calculat=
ion,
therefore the greater the sway exercised by superior intelligence. What the
superior understanding gains is abstracted in part from chance, but not
necessarily altogether, and therefore we are not obliged to answer the firs=
t
question affirmatively. Moreover, we must not forget that a superior
understanding is not the only mental quality of a general; courage, energy,
resolution, presence of mind, etc., are qualities which rise again to a hig=
her
value when all depends on one single great decision; they will, therefore, =
have
somewhat less weight when there is an equipoised play of forces, and the
predominating ascendancy of sagacious calculation increases not only at the
expense of chance, but also at the expense of these qualities. On the other
hand, these brilliant qualities, at the moment of a great decision, may rob
chance of a great part of its power, and therefore, to a certain extent, se=
cure
that which calculating intelligence in such cases would be obliged to leave=
 to
chance. We see by this that here a conflict takes place between several for=
ces,
and that we cannot positively assert that there is a greater field left ope=
n to
chance in the case of a great decision, than in the total result when that
equipoised play of forces takes place. If we, therefore, see more particula=
rly
in this play of forces a contest of mutual skill, that must only be taken t=
o
refer to skill in sagacious calculation, and not to the sum total of milita=
ry
genius.
</p>

<p>
Now it is just from this aspect of strategic man=C5=93uvring that the whole=
 has
obtained that false importance of which we have spoken above. In the first
place, in this skilfulness the whole genius of a general has been supposed =
to
consist; but this is a great mistake, for it is, as already said, not to be
denied that in moments of great decisions other moral qualities of a genera=
l
may have power to control the force of events. If this power proceeds more =
from
the impulse of noble feelings and those sparks of genius which start up alm=
ost
unconsciously, and therefore does not proceed from long chains of thought,
still it is not the less a free citizen of the art of war, for that art is
neither a mere act of the understanding, nor are the activities of the
intellectual faculties its principal ones. Further, it has been supposed th=
at
every active campaign without results must be owing to that sort of skill o=
n
the part of one, or even of both generals, while in reality it has always h=
ad
its general and principal foundation just in the general relations which ha=
ve
turned war into such a game.
</p>

<p>
As most wars between civilised states have had for their object rather the
observation of the enemy than his destruction, therefore it was only natura=
l
that the greater number of the campaigns should bear the character of strat=
egic
man=C5=93uvring. Those amongst them which did not bring into notice any ren=
owned
generals, attracted no attention; but where there was a great commander on =
whom
all eyes were fixed, or two opposed to each other, like Turenne and
Montecuculi, there the seal of perfection has been stamped upon this whole =
art
of man=C5=93uvring through the names of these generals. A further consequen=
ce has
then been that this game has been looked upon as the summit of the art, as =
the
manifestation of its highest perfection, and consequently also as the sourc=
e at
which the art of war must chiefly be studied.
</p>

<p>
This view prevailed almost universally in the theoretical world before the =
wars
of the French Revolution. But when these wars at one stroke opened to view =
a
quite different world of phenomena in war, at first somewhat rough and wild=
,
but which afterwards, under Buonaparte systematised into a method on a gran=
d
scale, produced results which created astonishment amongst old and young, t=
hen
people set themselves free from the old models, and believed that all the
changes they saw resulted from modern discoveries, magnificent ideas, etc.;=
 but
also at the same time, certainly from the changes in the state of society. =
It
was now thought that what was old would never more be required, and would n=
ever
even reappear. But as in such revolutions in opinions two parties are alway=
s
formed, so it was also in this instance, and the old views found their
champions, who looked upon the new phenomena as rude blows of brute force, =
as a
general decadence of the art; and held the opinion that, in the
evenly-balanced, nugatory, fruitless war game, the perfection of the art is
realised. There lies at the bottom of this last view such a want of logic a=
nd
philosophy, that it can only be termed a hopeless, distressing confusion of
ideas. But at the same time the opposite opinion, that nothing like the pas=
t
will ever reappear, is very irrational. Of the novel appearances manifested=
 in
the domain of the art of war, very few indeed are to be ascribed to new
discoveries, or to a change in the direction of ideas; they are chiefly
attributable to the alterations in the social state and its relations. But =
as
these took place just at the crisis of a state of fermentation, they must n=
ot
be taken as a norm; and we cannot, therefore, doubt that a great part of th=
e
former manifestations of war, will again make their appearance. This is not=
 the
place to enter further into these matters; it is enough for us that by
directing attention to the relation which this even-balanced play of forces
occupies in the whole conduct of a war, and to its signification and connec=
tion
with other objects, we have shown that it is always produced by constraint =
laid
on both parties engaged in the contest, and by a military element greatly
attenuated. In this game one general may show himself more skilful than his
opponent; and therefore, if the strength of his army is equal, he may also =
gain
many advantages over him; or if his force is inferior, he may, by his super=
ior
talent, keep the contest evenly balanced; but it is completely contradictor=
y to
the nature of the thing to look here for the highest honour and glory of a
general; such a campaign is always rather a certain sign that neither of th=
e
generals has any great military talent, or that he who has talent is preven=
ted
by the force of circumstances from venturing on a great decision; but when =
this
is the case, there is no scope afforded for the display of the highest mili=
tary
genius.
</p>

<p>
We have hitherto been engaged with the general character of strategic
man=C5=93uvring; we must now proceed to a special influence which it has on=
 the
conduct of war, namely this, that it frequently leads the combatants away f=
rom
the principal roads and places into unfrequented, or at least unimportant
localities. When trifling interests, which exist for a moment and then
disappear, are paramount, the great features of a country have less influen=
ce
on the conduct of the war. We therefore often find that bodies of troops mo=
ve
to points where we should never look for them, judging only by the great an=
d
simple requirements of the war; and that consequently, also, the changefuln=
ess
and diversity in the details of the contest as it progresses, are much grea=
ter
here than in wars directed to a great decision. Let us only look how in the
last five campaigns of the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, in spite of the relati=
ons in
general remaining unchanged in themselves, each of these campaigns took a
different form, and, closely examined, no single measure ever appears twice=
;
and yet in these campaigns the offensive principle manifests itself on the =
side
of the allied army much more decidedly than in most other earlier wars.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter on the defence of a theatre of war, if no great decision is
proposed, we have only shown the tendencies of the action, together with it=
s
combination, and the relations and character of the same; the particular
measures of which it is composed have been described in detail in a former =
part
of our work. Now the question arises whether for these different tendencies=
 of
action no thoroughly general comprehensive principles, rules, or methods ca=
n be
given. To this we reply that, as far as history is concerned, we have decid=
edly
not been led to any deductions of that kind through constantly recurring fo=
rms;
and at the same time, for a subject so diversified and changeful in its gen=
eral
nature, we could hardly admit any theoretical rule, except one founded on
experience. A war directed to great decisions is not only much simpler, but
also much more in accordance with nature; is more free from inconsistencies=
,
more objective, more restricted by a law of inherent necessity; hence the m=
ind
can prescribe forms and laws for it; but for a war without a decision for i=
ts
object, this appears to us to be much more difficult. Even the two fundamen=
tal
principles of the earliest theories of strategy published in our times, the
<i>Breadth of the Base</i>, in Bulow, and the <i>Position on Interior
Lines</i>, in Jomini, if applied to the defence of a theatre of war, have i=
n no
instance shown themselves absolute and effective. But being mere forms, thi=
s is
just where they should show themselves most efficacious, because forms are
always more efficacious, always acquire a preponderance over other factors =
of
the product, the more the action extends over time and space. Notwithstandi=
ng
this, we find that they are nothing more than particular parts of the subje=
ct,
and certainly anything but decisive advantages. It is very clear that the
peculiar nature of the means and the relations must always from the first h=
ave
a great influence adverse to all general principles. What Daun did by the
extent and provident choice of positions, the king did by keeping his army
always concentrated, always hugging the enemy close, and by being always re=
ady
to act extemporally with his whole army. The method of each general proceed=
ed
not only from the nature of the army he commanded, but also from the
circumstances in which he was placed. To extemporise movements is always mu=
ch
easier for a king than for any commander who acts under responsibility. We
shall here once more point out particularly that the critic has no right to
look upon the different manners and methods which may make their appearance=
 as
different degrees on the road to perfection, the one inferior to the other;
they are entitled to be treated as on an equality, and it must rest with th=
e
judgment to estimate their relative fitness for use in each particular case=
.
</p>

<p>
To enumerate these different manners which may spring from the particular
nature of an army, of a country, or of circumstances, is not our object her=
e;
the influence of these things generally we have already noticed.
</p>

<p>
We acknowledge, therefore, that in this chapter we are unable to give any
maxims, rules, or methods, because history does not furnish the means; and =
on
the contrary, at almost every moment, we there meet with peculiarities such=
 as
are often quite inexplicable, and often also surprise us by their singulari=
ty.
But it is not on that account unprofitable to study history in connection w=
ith
this subject also. Where neither system nor any dogmatic apparatus can be
found, there may still be truth, and this truth will then, in most cases, o=
nly
be discovered by a practised judgment and the tact of long experience.
Therefore, even if history does not here furnish any formula, we may be cer=
tain
that here as well as everywhere else, it will give us <i>exercise for the
judgment</i>.
</p>

<p>
We shall only set up one comprehensive general principle, or rather we shal=
l
reproduce, and present to view more vividly, in the form of a separate
principle, the natural presupposition of all that has now been said.
</p>

<p>
All the means which have been here set forth have only a <i>relative</i> va=
lue;
they are all placed under the legal ban of a certain disability on both sid=
es;
above this region a higher law prevails, and there is a totally different w=
orld
of phenomena. The general must never forget this; he must never move in
imaginary security within the narrower sphere, as if he were in an
<i>absolute</i> medium; never look upon the means which he employs here as =
the
<i>necessary</i> or as the <i>only means, and still adhere to them, even wh=
en
he himself already trembles at their insufficiency</i>.
</p>

<p>
From the point of view at which we have here placed ourselves, such an erro=
r
may appear to be almost impossible; but it is not impossible in the real wo=
rld,
because there things do not appear in such sharp contrast.
</p>

<p>
We must just again remind our readers that, for the sake of giving clearnes=
s,
distinctness, and force to our ideas, we have always taken as the subject o=
f
our consideration only the complete antithesis, that is the two extremes of=
 the
question, but that the concrete case in war generally lies between these tw=
o
extremes, and is only influenced by either of these extremes according to t=
he
degree in which it approaches nearer towards it.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, quite commonly, everything depends on the general making up his =
own
mind before all things as to whether his adversary has the inclination and =
the
means of outbidding him by the use of greater and more decisive measures. A=
s
soon as he has reason to apprehend this, he must give up small measures
intended to ward off small disadvantages; and the course which remains for =
him
then is to put himself in a better situation, by a voluntary sacrifice, in
order to make himself equal to a greater solution. In other words, the firs=
t
requisite is that the general should take the right scale in laying out his
work.
</p>

<p>
In order to give these ideas still more distinctness through the help of re=
al
experience, we shall briefly notice a string of cases in which, according t=
o
our opinion, a false criterion was made use of, that is, in which one of th=
e
generals in the calculation of his operations very much underestimated the
decisive action intended by his adversary. We begin with the opening of the
campaign of 1757, in which the Austrians showed by the disposition of their
forces that they had not counted upon so thorough an offensive as that adop=
ted
by Frederick the Great; even the delay of Piccolomini=E2=80=99s corps on th=
e
Silesian frontier while Duke Charles of Lorraine was in danger of having to
surrender with his whole army, is a similar case of complete misconception =
of
the situation.
</p>

<p>
In 1758, the French were in the first place completely taken in as to the
effects of the convention of Kloster Seeven (a fact, certainly, with which =
we
have nothing to do here), and two months afterwards they were completely
mistaken in their judgment of what their opponent might undertake, which, v=
ery
shortly after, cost them the country between the Weser and the Rhine. That
Frederick the Great, in 1759, at Maxen, and in 1760, at Landshut, completel=
y
misjudged his enemies in not supposing them capable of such decisive measur=
es
has been already mentioned.
</p>

<p>
But in all history we can hardly find a greater error in the criterion than
that in 1792. It was then imagined possible to turn the tide in a national =
war
by a moderate sized auxiliary army, which brought down on those who attempt=
ed
it the enormous weight of the whole French people, at that time completely
unhinged by political fanaticism. We only call this error a great one becau=
se
it has proved so since, and not because it would have been easy to avoid it=
. As
far as regards the conduct of the war itself, it cannot be denied that the
foundation of all the disastrous years which followed was laid in the campa=
ign
of 1794. On the side of the allies in that campaign, even the powerful natu=
re
of the enemy=E2=80=99s system of attack was quite misunderstood, by opposin=
g to
it a pitiful system of extended positions and strategic man=C5=93uvres; and=
 further
in the want of unanimity between Prussia and Austria politically, and the
foolish abandonment of Belgium and the Netherlands, we may also see how lit=
tle
presentiment the cabinets of that day had of the force of the torrent which=
 had
just broken loose. In the year 1796, the partial acts of resistance offered=
 at
Montenotte, Lodi, etc., etc., show sufficiently how little the Austrians
understood the main point when confronted by a Buonaparte.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1800 it was not by the direct effect of the surprise, but by th=
e
false view which Melas took of the possible consequences of this surprise, =
that
his catastrophe was brought about.
</p>

<p>
Ulm, in the year 1805, was the last knot of a loose network of scientific b=
ut
extremely feeble strategic combinations, good enough to stop a Daun or a La=
scy
but not a Buonaparte, the Revolution=E2=80=99s Emperor.
</p>

<p>
The indecision and embarrassment of the Prussians in 1806, proceeded from
antiquated, pitiful, impracticable views and measures being mixed up with s=
ome
lucid ideas and a true feeling of the immense importance of the moment. If
there had been a distinct consciousness and a complete appreciation of the
position of the country, how could they have left 30,000 men in Prussia, an=
d
then entertained the idea of forming a special theatre of war in Westphalia=
,
and of gaining any results from a trivial offensive such as that for which
Ruchel=E2=80=99s and the Weimar corps were intended? and how could they hav=
e
talked of danger to magazines and loss of this or that strip of territory i=
n
the last moments left for deliberation?
</p>

<p>
Even in 1812, in that grandest of all campaigns, there was no want at first=
 of
unsound purposes proceeding from the use of an erroneous standard Scale. In=
 the
head quarters at Wilna there was a party of men of high mark who insisted o=
n a
battle on the frontier, in order that no hostile foot should tread on Russi=
an
ground with impunity. That this battle on the frontier <i>might</i> be lost=
,
nay, that it <i>would</i> be lost, these men certainly admitted; for althou=
gh
they did not know that there would be 300,000 French to meet 80,000 Russian=
s,
still they knew that the enemy was considerably superior in numbers. The ch=
ief
error was in the value which they ascribed to this battle; they thought it
would be a lost battle, like many other lost battles, whereas it may with
certainty be asserted that this great battle on the frontier would have
produced a succession of events completely different to those which actuall=
y
took place. Even the camp at Drissa was a measure at the root of which ther=
e
lay a completely erroneous standard with regard to the enemy. If the Russia=
n
army had been obliged to remain there they would have been completely isola=
ted
and cut off from every quarter, and then the French army would not have bee=
n at
a loss for means to compel the Russians to lay down their arms. The designe=
r of
that camp never thought of power and will on such a scale as that.
</p>

<p>
But even Buonaparte sometimes used a false standard. After the armistice of
1813 he thought to hold in check the subordinate armies of the allies under
Bl=C3=BCcher and the Crown Prince of Sweden by corps which were certainly n=
ot able
to offer any effectual resistance, but which might impose sufficiently on t=
he
cautious to prevent their risking anything, as had so often been done in
preceding wars. He did not reflect sufficiently on the reaction proceeding =
from
the deep-rooted resentment with which both Bl=C3=BCcher and Bulow were anim=
ated, and
from the imminent danger in which they were placed.
</p>

<p>
In general, he under-estimated the enterprising spirit of old Bl=C3=BCcher.=
 At
Leipsic Bl=C3=BCcher alone wrested from him the victory; at Laon Bl=C3=BCch=
er might have
entirely ruined him, and if he did not do so the cause lay in circumstances
completely out of the calculation of Buonaparte; lastly, at Belle-Alliance,=
 the
penalty of this mistake reached him like a thunderbolt.

nce</h3>

<p>
If two ideas form an exact logical antithesis, that is to say if the one is=
 the
complement of the other, then, in fact, each one is implied in the other; a=
nd
when the limited power of our mind is insufficient to apprehend both at onc=
e,
and, by the mere antithesis, to recognise in the one perfect conception the
totality of the other also, still, at all events, the one always throws on =
the
other a strong, and in many parts a sufficient light Thus we think the firs=
t
chapter on the defence throws a sufficient light on all the points of the
attack which it touches upon. But it is not so throughout in respect of eve=
ry
point; the train of thought could nowhere be carried to a finality; it is,
therefore, natural that where the opposition of ideas does not lie so
immediately at the root of the conception as in the first chapters, all tha=
t
can be said about the attack does not follow directly from what has been sa=
id
on the defence. An alteration of our point of view brings us nearer to the
subject, and it is natural for us to observe, at this closer point of view,
that which escaped observation at our former standpoint. What is thus perce=
ived
will, therefore, be the complement of our former train of thought; and it w=
ill
not unfrequently happen that what is said on the attack will throw a new li=
ght
on the defence.
</p>

<p>
In treating of the attack we shall, of course, very frequently have the sam=
e
subjects before us with which our attention has been occupied in the defenc=
e.
But we have no intention, nor would it be consistent with the nature of the
thing, to adopt the usual plan of works on engineering, and in treating of =
the
attack, to circumvent or upset all that we have found of positive value in =
the
defence, by showing that against every means of defence, there is an infall=
ible
method of attack. The defence has its strong points and weak ones; if the f=
irst
are even not unsurmountable, still they can only be overcome at a
disproportionate price, and that must remain true from whatever point of vi=
ew
we look at it, or we get involved in a contradiction. Further, it is not ou=
r
intention thoroughly to review the reciprocal action of the means; each mea=
ns
of defence suggests a means of attack; but this is often so evident, that t=
here
is no occasion to transfer oneself from our standpoint in treating of the
defence to a fresh one for the attack, in order to perceive it; the one iss=
ues
from the other of itself. Our object is, in each subject, to set forth the
peculiar relations of the attack, so far as they do not directly come out o=
f
the defence, and this mode of treatment must necessarily lead us to many
chapters to which there are no corresponding ones in the defence.

<h3><a name=3D"chap97"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>Nature of the Strategical Attack<=
/h3>

<p>
We have seen that the defensive in war generally=E2=80=94therefore, also, t=
he
strategic defensive=E2=80=94is no absolute state of expectancy and warding =
off,
therefore no completely passive state, but that it is a relative state, and
consequently impregnated more or less with offensive principles. In the sam=
e
way the offensive is no homogeneous whole, but incessantly mixed up with th=
e
defensive. But there is this difference between the two, that a defensive,
without an offensive return blow, cannot be conceived; that this return blo=
w is
a necessary constituent part of the defensive, whilst in the attack, the bl=
ow
or act is in itself one complete idea. The defence in itself is not necessa=
rily
a part of the attack; but time and space, to which it is inseparably bound,
import into it the defensive as a necessary evil. For in the <i>first</i>
place, the attack cannot be continued uninterruptedly up to its conclusion,=
 it
must have stages of rest, and in these stages, when its action is neutralis=
ed,
the state of defence steps in of itself; in the <i>second</i> place, the sp=
ace
which a military force, in its advance, leaves behind it, and which is
essential to its existence, cannot always be covered by the attack itself, =
but
must be specially protected.
</p>

<p>
The act of attack in war, but particularly in that branch which is called
strategy, is therefore a perpetual alternating and combining of attack and
defence; but the latter is not to be regarded as an effectual preparation f=
or
attack, as a means by which its force is heightened, that is to say, not as=
 an
active principle, but purely as a necessary evil; as the retarding weight
arising from the specific gravity of the mass; it is its original sin, its =
seed
of mortality. We say: a <i>retarding</i> weight, because if the defence doe=
s
not contribute to strengthen the attack, it must tend to diminish its effec=
t by
the very loss of time which it represents. But now, may not this defensive
element, which is contained in every attack, have over it a <i>positively
disadvantageous</i> influence? If we suppose the <i>attack is the weaker, t=
he
defence the stronger form of war</i>, it seems to follow that the latter ca=
n
not act in a positive sense prejudicially on the former; for as long as we =
have
sufficient force for the weaker form, we should have more than enough for t=
he
stronger. In general=E2=80=94that is, as regards the chief part=E2=80=94thi=
s is
true: in its detail we shall analyse it more precisely in the chapter on th=
e
<i>culminating point of victory;</i> but we must not forget that that
superiority of the <i>strategic defence</i> is partly founded in this, that=
 the
attack itself cannot take place without a mixture of defence, and of a
defensive of a very weak kind; what the assailant has to carry about with h=
im
of this kind are its worst elements; with respect to these, that which hold=
s
good of the whole, in a general sense, cannot be maintained; and therefore =
it
is conceivable that the defensive may act upon the attack positively as a
weakening principle. It is just in these moments of weak defensive in the
attack, that the positive action of the offensive principle in the
<i>defensive</i> should be introduced. During the twelve hours rest which
usually succeeds a day=E2=80=99s work, what a difference there is between t=
he
situation of the defender in his chosen, well-known, and prepared position,=
 and
that of the assailant occupying a bivouac, into which=E2=80=94like a blind
man=E2=80=94he has groped his way, or during a longer period of rest, requi=
red to
obtain provisions and to await reinforcements, etc., when the defender is c=
lose
to his fortresses and supplies, whilst the situation of the assailant, on t=
he
other hand, is like that of a bird on a tree. Every attack must lead to a
defence; what is to be the result of that defence, depends on circumstances=
;
these circumstances may be very favourable if the enemy=E2=80=99s forces ar=
e
destroyed; but they may be very unfavourable if such is not the case. Altho=
ugh
this defensive does not belong to the attack itself, its nature and effects
must re-act on the attack, and must take part in determining its value.
</p>

<p>
The deduction from this view is, that in every attack the defensive, which =
is
necessarily an inherent feature in the same, must come into consideration, =
in
order to see clearly the disadvantages to which it is subject, and to be
prepared for them.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in another respect, the attack is always in itself one a=
nd
the same. But the defensive has its gradations according as the principle o=
f
expectancy approaches to an end. This begets forms which differ essentially
from each other, as has been developed in the chapter on the forms of defen=
ce.
</p>

<p>
As the principle of the attack is <i>strictly</i> active, and the defensive=
,
which connects itself with it, is only a dead weight; there is, therefore, =
not
the same kind of difference in it. No doubt, in the energy employed in the
attack, in the rapidity and force of the blow, there may be a great differe=
nce,
but only a difference in <i>degree</i>, not in <i>form</i>.=E2=80=94It is q=
uite
possible to conceive even that the assailant may choose a defensive form, t=
he
better to attain his object; for instance, that he may choose a strong
position, that he may be attacked there; but such instances are so rare tha=
t we
do not think it necessary to dwell upon them in our grouping of ideas and
facts, which are always founded on the practical. We may, therefore, say th=
at
there are no such gradations in the attack as those which present themselve=
s in
the defence.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, as a rule, the extent of the means of attack consists of the armed
force only; of course, we must add to these the fortresses, for if in the
vicinity of the theatre of war, they have a decided influence on the attack=
.
But this influence gradually diminishes as the attack advances; and it is
conceivable that, in the attack, its own fortresses never can play such an
important part as in the defence, in which they often become objects of pri=
mary
importance. The assistance of the people may be supposed in co-operation wi=
th
the attack, in those cases in which the inhabitants of the country are bett=
er
disposed towards the invader of the country than they are to their own army=
;
finally, the assailant may also have allies, but then they are only the res=
ult
of special or accidental relations, not an assistance proceeding from the
nature of the aggressive. Although, therefore, in speaking of the defence w=
e
have reckoned fortresses, popular insurrections, and allies as available me=
ans
of resistance; we cannot do the same in the attack; there they belong to th=
e
nature of the thing; here they only appear rarely, and for the most part
accidentally.

<h3><a name=3D"chap98"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>Of the Objects of Strategical At=
tack</h3>

<p>
The overthrow of the enemy is the aim in war; destruction of the hostile
military forces, the means both in attack and defence. By the destruction o=
f
the enemy=E2=80=99s military force, the defensive is led on to the offensiv=
e, the
offensive is led by it to the conquest of territory. Territory is, therefor=
e,
the object of the attack; but that need not be a whole country, it may be
confined to a part, a province, a strip of country, a fortress. All these
things may have a substantial value from their political importance, in
treating for peace, whether they are retained or exchanged.
</p>

<p>
The object of the strategic attack is, therefore, conceivable in an infinit=
e
number of gradations, from the conquest of the whole country down to that o=
f
some insignificant place. As soon as this object is attained, and the attac=
k
ceases, the defensive commences. We may, therefore, represent to ourselves =
the
strategic attack as a distinctly limited unit. But it is not so if we consi=
der
the matter practically, that is in accordance with actual phenomena.
Practically the moments of the attack, that is, its views and measures, oft=
en
glide just as imperceptibly into the defence as the plans of the defence in=
to
the offensive. It is seldom, or at all events not always, that a general la=
ys
down positively for himself what he will conquer, he leaves that dependent =
on
the course of events. His attack often leads him further than he had intend=
ed;
after rest more or less, he often gets renewed strength, without our being
obliged to make out of this two quite different acts; at another time he is
brought to a standstill sooner than he expected, without, however, giving u=
p
his intentions, and changing to a real defensive. We see, therefore, that i=
f
the successful defence may change imperceptibly into the offensive; so on t=
he
other hand an attack may, in like manner, change into a defence. These
gradations must be kept in view, in order to avoid making a wrong applicati=
on
of what we have to say of the attack in general.

<p>
This is one of the principal points in strategy: on its right valuation in =
the
concrete, depends our being able to judge correctly what we are able to do.
</p>

<p>
The decrease of absolute power arises=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. Through the object of the attack, the occupation of the enemy=E2=80=99s
country; this generally commences first after the first decision, but the
attack does not cease upon the first decision.
</p>

<p>
2. Through the necessity imposed on the attacking army to guard the country=
 in
its rear, in order to preserve its line of communication and means of
subsistence.
</p>

<p>
3. Through losses in action and through sickness.
</p>

<p>
4. Distance of the various dep=C3=B4ts of supplies and reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
5. Sieges and blockades of fortresses.
</p>

<p>
6. Relaxation of efforts.
</p>

<p>
7. Secession of allies.
</p>

<p>
But frequently, in opposition to these weakening causes, there may be many
others which contribute to strengthen the attack. It is clear, at all event=
s,
that a net result can only be obtained by comparing these different quantit=
ies;
thus, for example, the weakening of the attack may be partly or completely
compensated, or even surpassed by the weakening of the defensive. This last=
 is
a case which rarely happens; we cannot always bring into the comparison any
more forces than those in the immediate front or at decisive points, not th=
e
whole of the forces in the field.=E2=80=94Different examples: The French in
Austria and Prussia, in Russia; the allies in France, the French in Spain.

<h3><a name=3D"chap100"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Culminating Point of the Attack</=
h3>

<p>
The success of the attack is the result of a present superiority of force, =
it
being understood that the moral as well as physical forces are included. In=
 the
preceding chapter we have shown that the power of the attack gradually exha=
usts
itself; possibly at the same time the superiority may increase, but in most
cases it diminishes. The assailant buys up prospective advantages which are=
 to
be turned to account hereafter in negotiations for peace; but, in the meant=
ime,
he has to pay down on the spot for them a certain amount of his military fo=
rce.
If a preponderance on the side of the attack, although thus daily diminishi=
ng,
is still maintained until peace is concluded, the object is attained. There=
 are
strategic attacks which have led to an immediate peace but such instances a=
re
rare; the majority, on the contrary, lead only to a point at which the forc=
es
remaining are just sufficient to maintain a defensive, and to wait for peac=
e.
Beyond that point the scale turns, there is a reaction; the violence of suc=
h a
reaction is commonly much greater than the force of the blow. This we call =
the
culminating point of the attack. As the object of the attack is the possess=
ion
of the enemy=E2=80=99s territory, it follows that the advance must continue=
 till
the superiority is exhausted; this cause, therefore, impels us towards the
ultimate object, and may easily lead us beyond it. If we reflect upon the
number of the elements of which an equation of the forces in action is
composed, we may conceive how difficult it is in many cases to determine wh=
ich
of two opponents has the superiority on his side. Often all hangs on the si=
lken
thread of imagination.
</p>

<p>
Everything then depends on discovering the culminating point by the fine ta=
ct
of judgment. Here we come upon a seeming contradiction. The defence is stro=
nger
than the attack; therefore we should think that the latter can never lead u=
s
too far, for as long as the weaker form remains strong enough for what is
required, the stronger form ought to be still more so.

<h3><a name=3D"chap101"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>Destruction of the Enemy=E2=80=
=99s Armies</h3>

<p>
The destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s armed forces is the means to the
end=E2=80=94What is meant by this=E2=80=94The price it costs=E2=80=94Differ=
ent points
of view which are possible in respect to the subject.
</p>

<p>
1, only to destroy as many as the object of the attack requires.
</p>

<p>
2, or as many on the whole as is possible.
</p>

<p>
3, the sparing of our own forces as the principal point of view.
</p>

<p>
4, this may again be carried so far, that the assailant does nothing toward=
s
the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force <i>except when a favourable
opportunity offers</i>, which may also be the case with regard to the objec=
t of
the attack, as already mentioned in the third chapter.
</p>

<p>
The only means of destroying the enemy=E2=80=99s armed force is by combat, =
but
this may be done in two ways: 1, directly, 2, indirectly, through a combina=
tion
of combats.=E2=80=94If, therefore, the battle is the chief means, still it =
is not
the only means. The capture of a fortress or of a portion of territory, is =
in
itself really a destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force, and it may also l=
ead to
a still greater destruction, and therefore, also, be an indirect means.
</p>

<p>
The occupation of an undefended strip of territory, therefore, in addition =
to
the value which it has as a direct fulfilment of the end, may also reckon a=
s a
destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s force as well. The man=C5=93uvring, so a=
s to draw
an enemy out of a district of country which he has occupied, is somewhat
similar, and must, therefore, only be looked at from the same point of view=
,
and not as a success of arms, properly speaking=E2=80=94These means are gen=
erally
estimated at more than they are worth=E2=80=94they have seldom the value of=
 a
battle; besides which it is always to be feared that the disadvantageous
position to which they lead, will be overlooked; they are seductive through=
 the
low price which they cost.
</p>

<p>
We must always consider means of this description as small investments, fro=
m
which only small profits are to be expected; as means suited only to very
limited State relations and weak motives. Then they are certainly better th=
an
battles without a purpose=E2=80=94than victories, the results of which cann=
ot be
realised to the full.

<h3><a name=3D"chap102"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>The Offensive Battle</h3>

<p>
What we have said about the defensive battle throws a strong light upon the
offensive also.
</p>

<p>
We there had in view that class of battle in which the defensive appears mo=
st
decidedly pronounced, in order that we might convey a more vivid impression=
 of
its nature;=E2=80=94but only the fewer number are of that kind; most battle=
s are
<i>demirencontres</i> in which the defensive character disappears to a grea=
t
extent. It is otherwise with the offensive battle: it preserves its charact=
er
under all circumstances, and can keep up that character the more boldly, as=
 the
defender is out of his proper <i>esse</i>. For this reason, in the battle w=
hich
is not purely defensive and in the real <i>rencontres</i>, there always rem=
ains
also something of the difference of the character of the battle on the one =
side
and on the other. The chief distinctive characteristic of the offensive bat=
tle
is the man=C5=93uvre to turn or surround, therefore, the initiative as well=
.
</p>

<p>
A combat in lines, formed to envelope, has evidently in itself great
advantages; it is, however, a subject of tactics. The attack must not give =
up
these advantages because the defence has a means of counteracting them; for=
 the
attack itself cannot make use of that means, inasmuch as it is one that is =
too
closely dependent upon other things connected with the defence. To be able =
in
turn to operate with success against the flanks of an enemy, whose aim is t=
o
turn our line, it is necessary to have a well chosen and well prepared
position. But what is much more important is, that all the advantages which=
 the
defensive possesses, cannot be made use of; most defences are poor makeshif=
ts;
the greater number of defenders find themselves in a very harassing and
critical position, in which, expecting the worst, they meet the attack half
way. The consequence of this is, that battles formed with enveloping lines,=
 or
even with an oblique front, which should properly result from an advantageo=
us
relation of the lines of communication, are commonly the result of a moral =
and
physical preponderance (Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena). Besides, in the first
battle fought, the base of the assailant, if not superior to that of the
defender, is still mostly very wide in extent, on account of the proximity =
of
the frontier; he can, therefore, afford to venture a little.=E2=80=94The
flank-attack, that is, the battle with oblique front, is moreover generally
more efficacious than the enveloping form. It is an erroneous idea that an
enveloping strategic advance from the very commencement must be connected w=
ith
it, as at Prague. (That strategic measure has seldom anything in common wit=
h
it, and is very hazardous; of which we shall speak further in the attack of=
 a
theatre of war.)
</p>

<p>
As it is an object with the commander in the defensive battle to delay the
decision as long as possible, and gain time, because a defensive battle
undecided at sunset is commonly one gained: therefore the commander, in the
offensive battle, requires to hasten the decision; but, on the other hand,
there is a great risk in too much haste, because it leads to a waste of for=
ces.
One peculiarity in the offensive battle is the uncertainty, in most cases, =
as
to the position of the enemy; it is a complete groping about amongst things
that are unknown (Austerlitz, Wagram, Hohenlinden, Jena, Katzbach). The mor=
e
this is the case, so much the more concentration of forces becomes paramoun=
t,
and turning a flank to be preferred to surrounding. That the principal frui=
ts
of victory are first gathered in the pursuit, we have already learnt in the
twelfth chapter of the 4th Book. According to the nature of the thing, the
pursuit is more an integral part of the whole action in the offensive than =
in
the defensive battle.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap103"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Passage of Rivers</h3>

<p>
1. A large river which crosses the direction of the attack is always very
inconvenient for the assailant: for when he has crossed it he is generally
limited to one point of passage, and, therefore, unless he remains close to=
 the
river he becomes very much hampered in his movements. Whether he meditates
bringing on a decisive battle after crossing, or may expect the enemy to at=
tack
him, he exposes himself to great danger; therefore, without a decided
superiority, both in moral and physical force, a general will not place him=
self
in such a position.
</p>

<p>
2. From this mere disadvantage of placing a river behind an army, a river i=
s
much oftener capable of defence than it would otherwise be. If we suppose t=
hat
this defence is not considered the only means of safety, but is so planned =
that
even if it fails, still a stand can be made near the river, then the assail=
ant
in his calculations must add to the resistance which he may experience in t=
he
defence of the river, all the advantages mentioned in No. 1, as being on th=
e
side of the defender of a river, and the effect of the two together is, tha=
t we
usually see generals show great respect to a river before they attack it if=
 it
is defended.
</p>

<p>
3. But in the preceding book we have seen, that under certain conditions, t=
he
real defence of a river promises right good results; and if we refer to
experience, we must allow that such results follow in reality much more
frequently than theory promises, because in theory we only calculate with r=
eal
circumstances as we find them take place, while in the execution, things
commonly appear to the assailant much more difficult than they really are, =
and
they become therefore a greater clog on his action.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, for instance, an attack which is not intended to end in a great
solution, and which is not conducted with thorough energy, we may be sure t=
hat
in carrying it out a number of little obstacles and accidents, which no the=
ory
could calculate upon, will start up to the disadvantage of the assailant,
because he is the acting party, and must, therefore, come first into collis=
ion
with such impediments. Let us just think for a moment how often some of the
insignificant rivers of Lombardy have been successfully defended!=E2=80=94I=
f, on
the other hand, cases may also be found in military history, in which the
defence of rivers has failed to realise what was expected of them, that lie=
s in
the extravagant results sometimes looked for from this means; results not
founded in any kind of way on its tactical nature, but merely on its well-k=
nown
efficacy, to which people have thought there were no bounds.
</p>

<p>
4. It is only when the defender commits the mistake of placing his entire
dependence on the defence of a river, so that in case it is forced he becom=
es
involved in great difficulty, in a kind of catastrophe, it is only then tha=
t
the defence of a river can be looked upon as a form of defence favourable t=
o
the attack, for it is certainly easier to force the passage of a river than=
 to
gain an ordinary battle.
</p>

<p>
5. It follows of itself from what has just been said that the defence of a
river may become of great value if no great solution is desired, but where =
that
is to be expected, either from the superior numbers or energy of the enemy,
then this means, if wrongly used, may turn to the positive advantage of the
assailant.
</p>

<p>
6. There are very few river-lines of defence which cannot be turned either =
on
the whole length or at some particular point. Therefore the assailant, supe=
rior
in numbers and bent upon serious blows, has the means of making a demonstra=
tion
at one point and passing at another, and then by superior numbers, and
advancing, regardless of all opposition, he can repair any disadvantageous
relations in which he may have been placed by the issue of the first
encounters: for his general superiority will enable him to do so. It very
rarely happens that the passage of a river is actually tactically forced by
overpowering the enemy=E2=80=99s principal post by the effect of superior f=
ire
and greater valour on the part of the troops, and the expression, <i>forcin=
g a
passage</i> is only to be taken in a strategic sense, in so far that the
assailant by his passage at an undefended or only slightly defended point
within the line of defence, braves all the dangers which, in the
defender=E2=80=99s view, should result to him through the crossing.=E2=80=
=94But the
worst which an assailant can do, is to attempt a real passage at several
points, unless they lie close to each other and admit of all the troops joi=
ning
in the combat; for as the defender must necessarily have his forces separat=
ed,
therefore, if the assailant fractions his in like manner, he throws away hi=
s
natural advantage. In that way Bellegarde lost the battle on the Mincio, 18=
14,
where by chance both armies passed at different points at the same time, an=
d
the Austrians were more divided than the French.
</p>

<p>
7. If the defender remains on this side of the river, it necessarily follow=
s
that there are two ways to gain a strategic advantage over him: either to p=
ass
at some point, regardless of his position, and so to outbid him in the same
means, or to give battle. In the first case, the relations of the base and
lines of communications should chiefly decide, but it often happens that
special circumstances exercise more influence than general relations; he wh=
o
can choose the best positions, who knows best how to make his dispositions,=
 who
is better obeyed, whose army marches fastest, etc., may contend with advant=
age
against general circumstances. As regards the second means, it presupposes =
on
the part of the assailant the means, suitable relations, and the determinat=
ion
to fight; but when these conditions may be presupposed, the defender will n=
ot
readily venture upon this mode of defending a river.
</p>

<p>
8. As a final result, we must therefore give as our opinion that, although =
the
passage of a river in itself rarely presents great difficulties, yet in all
cases not immediately connected with a great decision, so many apprehension=
s of
the consequences and of future complications are bound up with it, that at =
all
events the progress of the assailant may easily be so far arrested that he
either leaves the defender on this side the river, or he passes, and then
remains close to the river. For it rarely happens that two armies remain an=
y
length of time confronting one another on different sides of a river.
</p>

<p>
But also in cases of a great solution, a river is an important object; it
always weakens and deranges the offensive; and the most fortunate thing, in
this case is, if the defender is induced through that to look upon the rive=
r as
a tactical barrier, and to make the particular defence of that barrier the
principal act of his resistance, so that the assailant at once obtains the
advantage of being able to strike a decisive blow in a very easy
manner.=E2=80=94Certainly, in the first instance, this blow will never amou=
nt to
a complete defeat of the enemy, but it will consist of several advantageous
combats, and these bring about a state of general relations very adverse to=
 the
enemy, as happened to the Austrians on the Lower Rhine, 1796.

<h3><a name=3D"chap104"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>Attack on Defensive Positions</h=
3>

<p>
In the book on the defence, it has been sufficiently explained how far
defensive positions can compel the assailant either to attack them, or to g=
ive
up his advance. Only those which can effect this are subservient to our obj=
ect,
and suited to wear out or neutralise the forces of the aggressor, either wh=
olly
or in part, and in so far the attack can do nothing against such positions,
that is to say, there are no means at its disposal by which to counter-bala=
nce
this advantage. But defensive positions are not all really of this kind. If=
 the
assailant sees he can pursue his object without attacking such a position, =
it
would be an error to make the attack; if he cannot follow out his object, t=
hen
it is a question whether he cannot man=C5=93uvre the enemy out of his posit=
ion by
threatening his flank. It is only if such means are ineffectual, that a
commander determines on the attack of a good position, and then an attack
directed against one side, always in general presents the less difficulty; =
but
the choice of the side must depend on the position and direction of the mut=
ual
lines of retreat, consequently, on the threatening the enemy=E2=80=99s retr=
eat,
and covering our own. Between these two objects a competition may arise, in
which case the first is entitled to the preference, as it is of an offensiv=
e
nature; therefore homogeneous with the attack, whilst the other is of a
defensive character. But it is certain, and may be regarded as a truth of t=
he
first importance, that <i>to attack an enemy thoroughly inured to war, in a
good position, is a critical thing</i>. No doubt instances are not wanting =
of
such battles, and of successful ones too, as Torgau, Wagram (we do not say
Dresden, because we cannot call the enemy there quite aguerried); but upon =
the
whole, the danger is small, and it vanishes altogether, opposed to the infi=
nite
number of cases in which we have seen the most resolute commanders make the=
ir
bow before such positions. (Torres Vedras.)
</p>

<p>
We must not, however, confuse the subject now before us with ordinary battl=
es.
Most battles are real =E2=80=9C<i>rencontres</i>,=E2=80=9D in which one par=
ty
certainly occupies a position, but one which has not been prepared.

<h3><a name=3D"chap105"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>Attack on an Entrenched Camp</h3>

<p>
It was for a time the fashion to speak with contempt of entrenchments and t=
heir
utility. The cordon lines of the French frontier, which had been often burs=
t
through; the entrenched camp at Breslau in which the Duke of Bevern was
defeated, the battle of Torgau, and several other cases, led to this opinio=
n of
their value; and the victories of Frederick the Great, gained by the princi=
ple
of movement and the use of the offensive, threw a fresh light on all kind o=
f
defensive action, all fighting in a fixed position, particularly in
intrenchments, and brought them still more into contempt. Certainly, when a=
 few
thousand men are to defend several miles of country, and when entrenchments=
 are
nothing more than ditches reversed, they are worth nothing, and they consti=
tute
a dangerous snare through the confidence which is placed in them. But is it=
 not
inconsistent, or rather nonsensical, to extend this view even to the <i>ide=
a of
field fortification</i>, in a mere swaggering spirit (as Templehof does)? W=
hat
would be the object of entrenchments generally, if not to strengthen the
defence? No, not only reason but experience, in hundreds and thousands of
instances, show that a well-traced, sufficiently manned, and well defended
entrenchment is, <i>as a rule, to be looked upon as an impregnable point</i=
>,
and is also so regarded by the attack. Starting from this point of the
efficiency of a single entrenchment, we argue that there can be no doubt as=
 to
the attack of an entrenched camp being a most difficult undertaking, and on=
e in
which generally it will be impossible for the assailant to succeed.
</p>

<p>
It is consistent with the nature of an entrenched camp that it should be we=
akly
garrisoned; but with good, natural obstacles of ground and strong field wor=
ks,
it is possible to bid defiance to superior numbers. Frederick the Great
considered the attack of the camp of Pirna as impracticable, although he ha=
d at
his command double the force of the garrison; and although it has been sinc=
e
asserted, here and there, that it was quite possible to have taken it; the =
only
proof in favour of this assertion is founded on the bad condition of the Sa=
xon
troops; an argument which does not at all detract in any way from the value=
 of
entrenchments. But it is a question, whether those who have since contended=
 not
only for the feasibility but also for the facility of the attack, would hav=
e
made up their minds to execute it at the time.
</p>

<p>
We, therefore, think that the attack of an entrenched camp belongs to the
category of quite exceptional means on the part of the offensive. It is onl=
y if
the entrenchments have been thrown up in haste are not completed, still les=
s
strengthed by obstacles to prevent their being approached, or when, as is o=
ften
the case taken altogether, the whole camp is only an outline of what it was
intended to be, a half-finished ruin, that then an attack on it may be
advisable, and at the same time become the road to gain an easy conquest ov=
er
the enemy.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap106"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>Attack on a Mountain</h3>

<p>
From the fifth and following chapters of the sixth book, may be deduced
sufficiently the strategic relations of a mountain generally, both as regar=
ds
the defence and the attack. We have also there endeavoured to explain the p=
art
which a mountain plays as a line of defence, properly so called, and from t=
hat
naturally follows how it is to be looked upon in this signification from th=
e
side of the assailant. There remains, therefore, little for us to say here =
on
this important subject. Our chief result was there that the defence must ch=
oose
as his point of view a secondary combat, or the entirely different one of a
great general action; that in the first case the attack of a mountain can o=
nly
be regarded as a necessary evil, because all the circumstances are unfavour=
able
to it; but in the second case the advantages are on the side of the attack.
</p>

<p>
An attack, therefore, armed with the means and the resolution for a battle,
will give the enemy a meeting in the mountains, and certainly find his acco=
unt
in so doing.
</p>

<p>
But we must here once more repeat that it will be difficult to obtain respe=
ct
for this conclusion, because it runs counter to appearances, and is also, a=
t
first sight, contrary to the experience of war. It has been observed, in mo=
st
cases hitherto, that an army pressing forward to the attack (whether seekin=
g a
great general action or not), has considered it an unusual piece of good
fortune if the enemy has not occupied the intervening mountains, and has it=
self
then hastened to be beforehand in the occupation of them. No one will find =
this
forestalling of the enemy in any way inconsistent with the interests of the
assailant; in our view this is also quite admissible, only we must point ou=
t
clearly a fine distinction here between circumstances.
</p>

<p>
An army advancing against the enemy, with the design of bringing him to a
general action, if it has to pass over an unoccupied range of mountain, has
naturally to apprehend that the enemy may, at the last moment, block up tho=
se
very passes which it proposes to use on its march: in such a case, the
assailant will by no means have the same advantages as if the enemy occupie=
d
merely an ordinary mountain position. The latter is, for instance, not then=
 in
a position extended beyond measure, nor is he in uncertainty as to the road
which the assailant will take; the assailant has not been able to choose hi=
s
road with reference to the enemy=E2=80=99s position, and therefore this bat=
tle in
the mountains is not then united with all those advantages on his side of w=
hich
we have spoken in the sixth book; under such circumstances, the defender mi=
ght
be found in an impregnable position=E2=80=94According to this, the defender=
 might
even have means at his command of making advantageous use of the mountains =
for
a great battle.=E2=80=94This is, at any rate, possible; but if we reflect o=
n the
difficulties which the defender would have to encounter in establishing him=
self
in a strong position in the mountains just at the last moment, particularly=
 if
he has left it entirely unoccupied before, we may put down this means of
defence as one upon which no dependence can be placed, and therefore as one=
,
the <i>probability</i> of which the assailant has little reason to dread. B=
ut
even if it is a very improbable case, yet still it is natural to fear it; f=
or
in war, many a thing is very natural, and yet in a certain measure superflu=
ous.
</p>

<p>
But another measure which the assailant has to apprehend here is, a prelimi=
nary
defence of the mountains by an advanced guard or chain of outposts. This me=
ans,
also, will seldom accord with the interests of the defender; but the assail=
ant
has not the means of discerning how far it may be beneficial to the defende=
r or
otherwise, and therefore he has only to provide against the worst.
</p>

<p>
Further, our view by no means excludes the possibility of a position being
quite unassailable from the mountainous character of the ground: there are =
such
positions which are not, on that account, in the mountains (Pirna,
Schmotseifen, Meissen, Feldkirch), and it is just because they are not in t=
he
mountains, that they are so well suited for defence. We may also very well
conceive that positions may be found in mountains themselves where the defe=
nder
might avoid the ordinary disadvantages of mountain-positions, as, for insta=
nce,
on lofty <i>plateaux;</i> but they are not common, and we can only take int=
o
our view the generality of cases.
</p>

<p>
It is just in military history that we see how little mountain-positions ar=
e
suited to decisive defensive battles, for great generals have always prefer=
red
a position in the plains, when it was their object to fight a battle of the
first order; and throughout the whole range of military history, there are =
no
examples of decisive battles in the mountains, except in the Revolutionary
Wars, and even there it was plainly a false application and analogy which l=
ed
to the use of mountain-positions, where of necessity a decisive battle had =
to
be fought (1793 and 1794 in the Vosges, and 1795, 1796, and 1797 in Italy).
Melas has been generally blamed for not having occupied the Alpine passes i=
n
1800; but such criticisms are nothing more than =E2=80=9Cearly
notions=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94we might say=E2=80=94childlike judgments founded o=
n
appearances. Buonaparte, in Mela=E2=80=99s place, would just as little have
thought of occupying the passes.
</p>

<p>
The dispositions for the attack of mountain-positions are mostly of a tacti=
cal
nature; but we think it necessary to insert here the following remarks as t=
o
the general outline, consequently as to those parts which come into immedia=
te
contact with, and are coincident with, strategy.
</p>

<p>
1. As we cannot move wide of the roads in mountains as we can in other
districts, and form two or three columns out of one, when the exigency of t=
he
moment requires that the mass of the troops should be divided; but, on the
contrary, we are generally confined to long defiles; the advance in mountai=
ns
must generally be made on several roads, or rather upon a somewhat broader
front.
</p>

<p>
2. Against a mountain line of defence of wide extent, the attack must natur=
ally
be made with concentrated forces; to surround the whole cannot be thought o=
f
there, and if an important result is to be gained from victory, it must be
obtained rather by bursting through the enemy=E2=80=99s line, and separatin=
g the
wings, than by surrounding the force, and so cutting it off. A rapid,
continuous advance upon the enemy=E2=80=99s principal line of retreat is th=
ere
the natural endeavour of the assailant.
</p>

<p>
3. But if the enemy to be attacked occupies a position somewhat concentrate=
d,
turning movements are an essential part of the scheme of attack, as the fro=
nt
attacks fall upon the mass of the defender=E2=80=99s forces; but the turnin=
g
movements again must be made more with a view to cutting off the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
retreat, than as a tactical rolling up of the flank or attack on the rear; =
for
mountain positions are capable of a prolonged resistance even in rear if fo=
rces
are not wanting, and the quickest result is invariably to be expected only =
from
the enemy=E2=80=99s apprehension of losing his line of retreat; this sort o=
f
uneasiness arises sooner, and acts more powerfully in mountains, because, w=
hen
it comes to the worst, it is not so easy to make room sword in hand. A mere
demonstration is no sufficient means here; it might certainly man=C5=93uvre=
 the
enemy out of his position, but would not ensure any special result; the aim
must therefore be to cut him off, in reality, from his line of retreat.

<h3><a name=3D"chap107"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>Attack on Cordon Lines</h3>

<p>
If a supreme decision should lie in their defence and their attack, they pl=
ace
the assailant in an advantageous situation, for their wide extent is still =
more
in opposition to all the requirements of a decisive battle than the direct
defence of a river or a mountain range. Eugene=E2=80=99s lines of Denain, 1=
712,
are an illustration to the point here, for their loss was quite equal to a
complete defeat, but Villars would hardly have gained such a victory agains=
t
Eugene in a concentrated position. If the offensive side does not possess t=
he
means required for a decisive battle, then even lines are treated with resp=
ect,
that is, if they are occupied by the main body of an army; for instance, th=
ose
of Stollhofen, held by Louis of Baden in the year 1703, were respected even=
 by
Villars. But if they are only held by a secondary force, then it is merely =
a
question of the strength of the corps which we can spare for their attack. =
The
resistance in such cases is seldom great, but at the same time the result o=
f
the victory is seldom worth much.
</p>

<p>
The circumvallation lines of a besieger have a peculiar character, of which=
 we
shall speak in the chapter on the attack of a theatre of war.
</p>

<p>
All positions of the cordon kind, as, for instance, entrenched lines of
outposts, etc., etc., have always this property, that they can be easily br=
oken
through; but when they are not forced with a view of going further and brin=
ging
on a decision, there is so little to be gained in general by the attack, th=
at
it hardly repays the trouble expended.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap108"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>Man=C5=93uvring</h3>

<p>
1. We have already touched upon this subject in the thirtieth chapter of th=
e
sixth book. It is one which concerns the defence and the attack in common;
nevertheless it has always in it something more of the nature of the offens=
ive
than the defensive. We shall therefore now examine it more thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
2. Man=C5=93uvring is not only the opposite of executing the offensive by f=
orce, by
means of great battles; it stands also opposed to every such execution of t=
he
offensive as proceeds directly from offensive means, let it be either an
operation against the enemy=E2=80=99s communications, or line of retreat, a
diversion, etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
3. If we adhere to the ordinary use of the word, there is in the conception=
 of
man=C5=93uvring an effect which is first <i>produced</i>, to a certain exte=
nt, from
nothing, that is, from a state of rest or <i>equilibrium</i> through the
mistakes into which the enemy is enticed. It is like the first moves in a g=
ame
of chess. It is, therefore, a game of evenly-balanced powers, to obtain res=
ults
from favourable opportunity, and then to use these as an advantage over the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
4. But those interests which, partly as the final object, partly as the
principal supports (pivot) of action, must be considered in this matter, ar=
e
chiefly:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
(<i>a.</i>) The subsistence from which it is our object to cut off the enem=
y,
or to impede his obtaining.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b.</i>) The junction with other corps.
</p>

<p>
(<i>c.</i>) The threatening other communications with the interior of the
country, or with other armies or corps.
</p>

<p>
(<i>d.</i>) Threatening the retreat.
</p>

<p>
(<i>e.</i>) Attack of isolated points with superior forces
</p>

<p>
These five interests may establish themselves in the smallest features of
detail belonging to any particular situation; and any such object then beco=
mes,
on that account, a point round which everything for a time revolves. A brid=
ge,
a road, or an entrenchment, often thus plays the principal part. It is easy=
 to
show in each case that it is only the relation which any such object has to=
 one
of the above interests which gives it importance.
</p>

<p>
(<i>f.</i>) The result of a successful man=C5=93uvre, then, is for the offe=
nsive, or
rather for the active party (which may certainly be just as well the
defensive), a piece of land, a magazine, etc.
</p>

<p>
(<i>g.</i>) In a strategic man=C5=93uvre two converse propositions appear, =
which
look like different man=C5=93uvres, and have sometimes served for the deriv=
ation of
false maxims and rules, and have four branches, which are, however, in real=
ity,
all necessary constituents of the same thing, and are to be regarded as suc=
h.
The first antithesis is the surrounding the enemy, and the operating on
interior lines; the second is the concentration of forces, and their extens=
ion
over several posts.
</p>

<p>
(<i>h.</i>) As regards the first antithesis, we certainly cannot say that o=
ne
of its members deserves a general preference over the other; for partly it =
is
natural that action of one kind calls forth the other as its natural
counterpoise, its true remedy; partly the enveloping form is homogeneous to=
 the
attack, but the use of interior lines to the defence; and therefore, in mos=
t
cases, the first is more suitable to the offensive side, the latter to the
defensive. That form will gain the upper hand which is used with the greate=
st
skill.
</p>

<p>
(<i>i.</i>) The branches of the other antithesis can just as little be clas=
sed
the one above the other. The stronger force has the choice of extending its=
elf
over several posts; by that means he will obtain for himself a convenient
strategic situation, and liberty of action in many respects, and spare the
physical powers of his troops. The weaker, on the other hand, must keep him=
self
more concentrated, and seek by rapidity of movement to counteract the
disadvantage of his inferior numbers. This greater mobility supposes greate=
r
readiness in marching. The weaker must therefore put a greater strain on hi=
s
physical and moral forces,=E2=80=94a final result which we must naturally c=
ome
upon everywhere if we would always be consistent, and which, therefore, we
regard, to a certain extent, as the logical test of the reasoning. The
campaigns of Frederick the Great against Daun, in the years 1759 and 1760, =
and
against Laudon, 1761, and Montecuculis against Turenne in 1673, 1675, have
always been reckoned the most scientific combinations of this kind, and fro=
m
them we have chiefly derived our view.
</p>

<p>
(<i>j.</i>) Just as the four parts of the two antitheses above supposed mus=
t
not be abused by being made the foundation of false maxims and rules, so we
must also give a caution against attaching to other general relations, such=
 as
base, ground, etc., an importance and a decisive influence which they do no=
t in
reality possess. The smaller the interests at stake, so much the more impor=
tant
the details of time and place become, so much the more that which is genera=
l
and great falls into the background, having, in a certain measure no place =
in
small calculations. Is there to be found, viewed generally, a more absurd
situation than that of Turenne in 1675, when he stood with his back close t=
o
the Rhine, his army along a line of three miles in extent, and with his bri=
dge
of retreat at the extremity of his right wing? But his measures answered th=
eir
object, and it is not without reason that they are acknowledged to show a h=
igh
degree of skill and intelligence. We can only understand this result and th=
is
skill when we look more closely into details, and judge of them according t=
o
the value which they must have had in this particular case.
</p>

<p>
We are convinced that there are no rules of any kind for strategic man=C5=
=93uvring;
that no method, no general principle can determine the mode of action; but =
that
superior energy, precision, order, obedience, intrepidity in the most speci=
al
and trifling circumstances may find means to obtain for themselves signal
advantages, and that, therefore, chiefly on those qualities will depend the
victory in this sort of contest.

<h3><a name=3D"chap109"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>Attack on Morasses, Inundations=
, Woods</h3>

<p>
Morasses, that is, impassable swamps, which are only traversed by a few
embankments, present peculiar difficulties to the tactical attack, as we ha=
ve
stated in treating of the defence. Their breadth hardly ever admits of the
enemy being driven from the opposite bank by artillery, and of the construc=
tion
of a roadway across. The strategic consequence is that endeavours are made =
to
avoid attacking them by passing round them. Where the state of culture, as =
in
many low countries, is so great that the means of passing are innumerable, =
the
resistance of the defender is still strong enough relatively, but it is
proportionably weakened for an absolute decision, and, therefore, wholly
unsuitable for it. On the other hand, if the low land (as in Holland) is ai=
ded
by inundations, the resistance may become absolute, and defy every attack. =
This
was shown in Holland in the year 1672, when, after the conquest and occupat=
ion
of all the fortresses outside the margin of the inundation, 50,000 French
troops became available, who,=E2=80=94first under Cond=C3=A9 and then under
Luxemburg,=E2=80=94were unable to force the line of inundation, although it=
 was
only defended by about 20,000 men. The campaign of the Prussians, in 1787,
under the Duke of Brunswick, against the Dutch, ended, it is true, in a qui=
te
contrary way, as these lines were then carried by a force very little super=
ior
to the defenders, and with trifling loss; but the reason of that is to be f=
ound
in the dissensions amongst the defenders from political animosities, and a =
want
of unity in the command, and yet nothing is more certain than that the succ=
ess
of the campaign, that is, the advance through the last line of inundation u=
p to
the walls of Amsterdam depended on a point of such extreme nicety that it i=
s
impossible to draw any general deduction from this case. The point alluded =
to
was the leaving unguarded the Sea of Haarlem. By means of this, the Duke tu=
rned
the inundation line, and got in rear of the post of Amselvoen. If the Dutch=
 had
had a couple of armed vessels on this lake the duke would never have got to
Amsterdam, for he was =E2=80=9C<i>au bout de son latin.</i>=E2=80=9D What i=
nfluence
that might have had on the conclusion of peace does not concern us here, bu=
t it
is certain that any further question of carrying the last line of inundatio=
n
would have been put an end to completely.
</p>

<p>
The winter is, no doubt, the natural enemy of this means of defence, as the
French have shown in 1794 and 1795, but it must be a <i>severe</i> winter.
</p>

<p>
Woods, which are scarcely passable, we have also included amongst the means
which afford the defence powerful assistance. If they are of no great depth
then the assailant may force his way through by several roads running near =
one
another, and thus reach better ground, for no one point can have any great
tactical strength, as we can never suppose a wood as absolutely impassable =
as a
river or a morass.=E2=80=94But when, as in Russia and Poland, a very large =
tract
of country is nearly everywhere covered with wood, and the assailant has no=
t
the power of getting beyond it, then, certainly, his situation becomes very
embarrassing. We have only to think of the difficulties he must contend wit=
h to
subsist his army, and how little he can do in the depths of the forest to m=
ake
his ubiquitous adversary feel his superiority in numbers. Certainly this is=
 one
of the worst situations in which the offensive can be placed.

<h3><a name=3D"chap110"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>Attack on a Theatre of War with =
the View to a Decision</h3>

<p>
Most of the subjects have been already touched upon in the sixth book, and =
by
their mere reflection, throw sufficient light on the attack.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the conception of an enclosed theatre of war, has a nearer relati=
on
to the defence than to the attack. Many of the leading points, <i>the objec=
t of
attack, the sphere of action of victory</i>, etc., have been already treate=
d of
in that book, and that which is most decisive and essential on the nature o=
f
the attack, cannot be made to appear until we get to the plan of war: still
there remains a good deal to say here, and we shall again commence with the
campaign, <i>in which a great decision is positively intended</i>.
</p>

<p>
1. The first aim of the attack is a victory. To all the advantages which th=
e
defender finds in the nature of his situation, the assailant can only oppos=
e
superior numbers; and, perhaps, in addition, the slight advantage which the
feeling of being the offensive and advancing side gives an army. The import=
ance
of this feeling, however, is generally overrated; for it does not last long=
,
and will not hold out against real difficulties. Of course, we assume that =
the
defender is as faultless and judicious in all he does as the aggressor. Our
object in this observation is to set aside those vague ideas of sudden atta=
ck
and surprise, which, in the attack, are generally assumed to be fertile sou=
rces
of victory, and which yet, in reality, never occur except under special
circumstances. The nature of the real strategic surprise, we have already
spoken of elsewhere.=E2=80=94If, then, the attack is inferior in physical p=
ower,
it must have the ascendancy in moral power, in order to make up for the
disadvantages which are inherent in the offensive form; if the superiority =
in
that way is also wanting, then there are no good grounds for the attack, an=
d it
will not succeed.
</p>

<p>
2. As prudence is the real genius of the defender, so boldness and
self-confidence must animate the assailant. We do not mean that the opposit=
e
qualities in each case may be altogether wanting, but that the qualities na=
med
have the greatest affinity to the attack and defence respectively. These
qualities are only in reality necessary because action in war is no mere
mathematical calculation; it is activity which is carried on if not in the
dark, at all events in a feeble twilight, in which we must trust ourselves =
to
the leader who is best suited to carry out the aim we have in view.=E2=80=
=94The
weaker the defender shows himself morally, the bolder the assailant should
become.
</p>

<p>
3. For victory, it is necessary that there should be a battle between the
enemy=E2=80=99s principal force and our own. This is less doubtful as regar=
ds the
attack than in regard to the defence, for the assailant goes in search of t=
he
defender in his position. But we have maintained (in treating of the defens=
ive)
that the offensive should not seek the defender out if he has placed himsel=
f in
a <i>false</i> position, because he may be sure that the defender will seek
<i>him</i> out, and then he will have the advantage of fighting where the
defender has not prepared the ground. Here all depends on the road and
direction which have the greatest importance; this is a point which was not
examined in the defence, being reserved for the present chapter. We shall,
therefore, say what is necessary about it here.
</p>

<p>
4. We have already pointed out those objects to which the attack should be =
more
immediately directed, and which, therefore, are the ends to be obtained by
victory; now, if these are within the theatre of war which is attacked, and
within the probable sphere of victory, then the road to them is the natural
direction of the blow to be struck. But we must not forget that the object =
of
the attack does not generally obtain its signification until victory has be=
en
gained, and therefore the mind must always embrace the idea of victory with=
 it;
the principal consideration for the assailant is, therefore, not so much me=
rely
to reach the object as to reach it a conqueror; therefore the direction of =
his
blow should be not so much on the object itself as on the way which the
enemy=E2=80=99s army must take to reach it. This way is the immediate objec=
t of
the attack. To fall in with the enemy before he has reached this object, to=
 cut
him off from it, and in that position to beat him=E2=80=94to do this is to =
gain
an intensified victory.=E2=80=94If, for example, the enemy=E2=80=99s capita=
l is the
object of the attack, and the defender has not placed himself between it an=
d
the assailant, the latter would be wrong in marching direct upon the capita=
l,
he would do much better by taking his direction upon the line connecting th=
e
defender=E2=80=99s army with the capital, and seeking there the victory whi=
ch
shall place the capital in his hands.
</p>

<p>
If there is no great object within the assailant=E2=80=99s sphere of victor=
y,
then the enemy=E2=80=99s line of communication with the nearest great objec=
t to
him is the point of paramount importance. The question, then, for every
assailant to ask himself is, If I am successful in the battle, what is the
first use I shall make of the victory? The object to be gained, as indicate=
d by
the answer to this question, shows the natural direction for his blow. If t=
he
defender has placed himself in that direction, he has done right, and there=
 is
nothing to do but to go and look for him there. If his position is too stro=
ng,
then the assailant must seek to turn it, that is, make a virtue of necessit=
y.
But if the defender has not placed himself on this right spot, then the
assailant chooses that direction, and as soon as he comes in line with the
defender, if the latter has not in the mean time made a lateral movement, a=
nd
placed himself across his path, he should turn himself in the direction of =
the
defender=E2=80=99s line of communication in order to seek an action there; =
if the
defender remains quite stationary, then the assailant must wheel round towa=
rds
him and attack him in rear.
</p>

<p>
Of all the roads amongst which the assailant has a choice, the great roads
which serve the commerce of the country are always the best and the most
natural to choose. To avoid any very great bends, more direct roads, even i=
f
smaller, must be chosen, for a line of retreat which deviates much from a
direct line is always perilous.
</p>

<p>
5. The assailant, when he sets out with a view to a great decision, has sel=
dom
any reason for dividing his forces, and if, notwithstanding this, he does s=
o,
it generally proceeds from a want of clear views. He should therefore only
advance with his columns on such a width of front as will admit of their al=
l
coming into action together. If the enemy himself has divided his forces, s=
o
much the better for the assailant, and to preserve this further advantage s=
mall
demonstrations should be made against the enemy=E2=80=99s corps which have
separated from the main body; these are the strategic <i>fausses attaques;<=
/i>
a detachment of forces <i>for this purpose</i> would then be justifiable.
</p>

<p>
Such separation into several columns as is indispensably necessary must be =
made
use of for the disposition of the tactical attack in the enveloping form, f=
or
that form is natural to the attack, and must not be disregarded without goo=
d
reason. But it must be only of a tactical nature, for a strategic envelopme=
nt
when a great blow takes place, is a complete waste of power. It can only be
excused when the assailant is so strong that there can be no doubt at all a=
bout
the result.
</p>

<p>
6. But the attack requires also prudence, for the assailant has also a rear=
,
and has communications which must be protected. This service of protection =
must
be performed as far as possible by the manner in which the army advances, t=
hat
is, <i>eo ipso</i> by the army itself. If a force must be specially detaile=
d
for this duty, and therefore a partition of forces is required, this cannot=
 but
naturally weaken the force of the blow itself.=E2=80=94As a large army is a=
lways
in the habit of advancing with a front of a day=E2=80=99s march at least in
breadth, therefore, if the lines of retreat and communication do not deviat=
e
much from the perpendicular, the covering of those lines is in most cases
attained by the front of the army.
</p>

<p>
Dangers of this description, to which the assailant is exposed, must be
measured chiefly by the situation and character of the adversary. When
everything lies under the pressure of an imminent great decision, there is
little room for the defender to engage in undertakings of this description;=
 the
assailant has, therefore, in ordinary circumstances not much to fear. But i=
f
the advance is over, if the assailant himself is gradually passing into the
defensive, then the covering of the rear becomes every moment more necessar=
y,
becomes more a thing of the first importance. For the rear of the assailant
being naturally weaker than that of the defender, therefore the latter, lon=
g
before he passes over to the real offensive, and even at the same time that=
 he
is yielding ground, may have commenced to operate against the communication=
s of
the assailant.

<p>
1. Although there is neither the will nor the power sufficient for a great
decision, there may still exist a decided view in a strategic attack, but i=
t is
directed against some secondary object. If the attack succeeds, then, with =
the
attainment of this object the whole falls again into a state of rest and
equilibrium. If difficulties to a certain extent present themselves, the
general progress of the attack comes to a standstill before the object is
gained. Then in its place commences a mere occasional offensive or strategi=

contributions, sparing our own territory, equivalents in negotiations for
peace=E2=80=94such are the advantages to be derived from this procedure.
Sometimes an idea of the credit of the army is attached to it, as was
perpetually the case in the wars of the French Marshals in the time of Loui=
s
XIV. It makes a very important difference whether a portion of territory ca=
n be
kept or not. In general, the first is the case only when the territory is o=
n
the edge of our own theatre of war, and forms a natural complement of it. O=
nly
such portions come into consideration as an equivalent in negotiating a pea=
ce,
others are usually only taken possession of for the duration of a campaign,=
 and
to be evacuated when winter begins.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b.</i>) <i>One of the enemy=E2=80=99s principal magazines</i>. If it is=
 not
one of considerable importance, it can hardly be looked upon as the object =
of
an offensive determining a whole campaign. It certainly in itself is a loss=
 to
the defender, and a gain to the assailant; the great advantage, however, fr=
om
it for the latter, is that the loss may compel the defender to retire a lit=
tle
and give up a strip of territory which he would otherwise have kept. The
capture of a magazine is therefore in reality more a means, and is only spo=
ken
of here as an object, because, until captured, it becomes, for the time bei=
ng,
the immediate definite aim of action.
</p>

<p>
(<i>c.</i>) <i>The capture of a fortress.</i>=E2=80=94We have made the sieg=
e of
fortresses the subject of a separate chapter, to which we refer our readers=
.
For the reasons there explained, it is easy to conceive how it is that
fortresses always constitute the best and most desirable objects in those
offensive wars and campaigns in which views cannot be directed to the compl=
ete
overthrow of the enemy or the conquest of an important part of his territor=
y.
We may also easily understand how it is that in the wars in the Low Countri=
es,
where fortresses are so abundant, everything has always turned on the
possession of one or other of these fortresses, so much so, that the succes=
sive
conquests of whole provinces <i>never once appear as leading features;</i>
while, on the other hand, each of these strong places used to be regarded a=
s a
separate thing, which had an intrinsic value in itself, and more attention =
was
paid to the convenience and facility with which it could be attacked than t=
o
the value of the place itself.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the attack of a place of some importance is always a grea=
t
undertaking, because it causes a very large expenditure; and, in wars in wh=
ich
the whole is not staked at once on the game, this is a matter which ought t=
o be
very much considered. Therefore, such a siege takes its place here as one o=
f
the most important objects of a strategic attack. The more unimportant a pl=
ace
is, or the less earnestness there is about the siege, the smaller the
preparations for it, the more it is done as a thing <i>en passant</i>, so m=
uch
the smaller also will be the strategic object, and the more it will be a
service fit for small forces and limited views; and the whole thing then of=
ten
sinks into a kind of sham fight, in order to close the campaign with honour=
,
because as assailant it is incumbent to do something.
</p>

<p>
(<i>d.</i>) <i>A successful combat, encounter, or even battle</i>, for the =
sake
of trophies, or merely for the honour of the arms, sometimes even for the m=
ere
ambition of the commanders. That this does happen no one can doubt, unless =
he
knows nothing at all of military history. In the campaigns of the French du=
ring
the reign of Louis XIV., the most of the offensive battles were of this kin=
d.
But what is of more importance for us is to observe that these things are n=
ot
without objective value, they are not the mere pastime of vanity; they have=
 a
very distinct influence on peace, and therefore lead as it were direct to t=
he
object. The military fame, the moral superiority of the army and of the
general, are things, the influence of which, although unseen, never ceases =
to
bear upon the whole action in war.
</p>

<p>
The aim of such a combat of course presupposes; (<i>a</i>) that there is an
adequate prospect of victory, (<i>b</i>) that there is not a very heavy sta=
ke
dependent on the issue.=E2=80=94Such a battle fought in straitened relation=
s, and
with a limited object, must naturally not be confounded with a victory whic=
h is
not turned to profitable account merely from moral weakness.
</p>

<p>
3. With the exception of the last of these objects (<i>d</i>) they may all =
be
attained without a combat of importance, and generally they are so obtained=
 by
the offensive. Now, the means which the assailant has at command without
resorting to a decisive battle, are derived from the interests which the
defensive has to protect in his theatre of war; they consist, therefore, in
threatening his lines of communications, either through objects connected w=
ith
subsistence, as magazines, fertile provinces, water communications, etc., o=
r
important points (bridges, defiles, and such like,) or also by placing othe=
r
corps in the occupation of strong positions situated inconveniently near to=
 him
and from which he cannot again drive us out; the seizure of important towns=
,
fertile districts, disturbed parts of the country, which may be excited to
rebellion, the threatening of weak allies, etc., etc. Should the attack
effectually interrupt the communications, and in such a manner that the
defender cannot re-establish them but at a great sacrifice, it compels the
defender to take up another position more to the rear or to a flank to cove=
r
the objects, at the same time giving up objects of secondary importance. Th=
us a
strip of territory is left open; a magazine or a fortress uncovered: the on=
e
exposed to be overrun, the other to be invested. Out of this, combats great=
er
or less may arise, but in such case they are not sought for and treated as =
an
object of the war but as a necessary evil, and can never exceed a certain
degree of greatness and importance.
</p>

<p>
4. The operation of the defensive on the communications of the offensive, i=
s a
kind of reaction which in wars waged for the great solution, can only take
place when the lines of operation are very long; on the other hand, this ki=
nd
of reaction lies more in accordance with the nature of things in wars which=
 are
not aimed at the great solution. The enemy=E2=80=99s lines of communication=
 are
seldom very long in such a case; but then, neither is it here so much a
question of inflicting great losses of this description on the enemy, a mer=
e
impeding and cutting short his means of subsistence often produces an effec=
t,
and what the lines want in length is made up for in some degree by the leng=
th
of time which can be expended in this kind of contest with the enemy: for t=
his
reason, the covering his strategic flanks becomes an important object for t=
he
assailant. If, therefore, a contest (or rivalry) of this description takes
place between the assailant and defender, then the assailant must seek to
compensate by numbers for his natural disadvantages. If he retains sufficie=
nt
power and resolution still to venture a decisive stroke against one of the
enemy=E2=80=99s corps, or against the enemy=E2=80=99s main body itself, the=
 danger
which he thus holds over the head of his opponent is his best means of cove=
ring
himself.
</p>

<p>
5. In conclusion, we must notice another great advantage which the assailan=
t
certainly has over the defender in wars of this kind, which is that of bein=
g
better able to judge of the intentions and force of his adversary than the
latter can in turn of his. It is much more difficult to discover in what de=
gree
an assailant is enterprising and bold than when the defender has something =
of
consequence in his mind. Practically viewed, there usually lies already in =
the
choice of the defensive form of war a sort of guarantee that nothing positi=
ve
is intended; besides this, the preparations for a great reaction differ muc=
h
more from the ordinary preparations for defence than the preparations for a
great attack differ from those directed against minor objects. Finally, the
defender is obliged to take his measures soonest of the two, which gives th=
e
assailant the advantage of playing the last hand.

<h3><a name=3D"chap112"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>Attack on Fortresses</h3>

<p>
The attack on fortresses cannot of course come before us here in its aspect=
 as
a branch of the science of fortification or military works; we have only to
consider the subject, first, in its relation to the strategic object with w=
hich
it is connected; secondly, as regards the choice among several fortresses; =
and
thirdly, as regards the manner in which a siege should be covered.
</p>

<p>
That the loss of a fortress weakens the defence, especially in case it form=
s an
essential part of that defence; that many conveniences accrue to the assail=
ant
by gaining possession of one, inasmuch as he can use it for magazines and
dep=C3=B4ts, and by means of it can cover districts of country cantonments,=
 etc.;
that if his offensive at last should have to be changed into the defensive,=
 it
forms the very best support for that defensive=E2=80=94all these relations =
which
fortresses bear to theatres of war, in the course of a war, make themselves
sufficiently evident by what has been said about fortresses in the book on =
the
Defence, the reflection from which throws all the light required on these
relations with the attack.
</p>

<p>
In relation to the taking of strong places, there is also a great differenc=
e
between campaigns which tend to a great decision and others. In the first, =
a
conquest of this description is always to be regarded as an evil which is
unavoidable. As long as there is yet a decision to be made, we undertake no
sieges but such as are positively unavoidable. When the decision has been
already given=E2=80=94the crisis, the utmost tension of forces, some time
passed=E2=80=94and when, therefore, a state of rest has commenced, then the
capture of strong places serves as a consolidation of the conquests made, a=
nd
then they can generally be carried out, if not without effort and expenditu=
re
of force, at least without danger. In the crisis itself the siege of a fort=
ress
heightens the intensity of the crisis to the prejudice of the offensive; it=
 is
evident that nothing so much weakens the force of the offensive, and theref=
ore
there is nothing so certain to rob it of its preponderance for a season. Bu=
t
there are cases in which the capture of this or that fortress is quite
unavoidable, if the offensive is to be continued, and in such case a siege =
is
to be considered as an intensified progress of the attack; the crisis will =
be
so much greater the less there has been decided previously. All that remain=
s
now for consideration on this subject belongs to the book on the plan of th=
e
war.
</p>

<p>
In campaigns with a limited object, a fortress is generally not the means b=
ut
the end itself; it is regarded as a small independent conquest, and as such=
 has
the following advantages over every other:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. That a fortress is a small, distinctly-defined conquest, which does not
require a further expenditure of force, and therefore gives no cause to fea=
r a
reaction.
</p>

<p>
2. That in negotiating for peace, its value as an equivalent may be turned =
to
account.
</p>

<p>
3. That a siege is a real progress of the attack, or at least seems so, wit=
hout
constantly diminishing the force like every other advance of the offensive.
</p>

<p>
4. That the siege is an enterprise without a catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
The result of these things is that the capture of one or more of the
enemy=E2=80=99s strong places, is very frequently the object of those strat=
egic
attacks which cannot aim at any higher object.
</p>

<p>
The grounds which decide the choice of the fortress which should be attacke=
d,
in case that may be doubtful, generally are=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) That it is one which can be easily kept, therefore stands high i=
n
value as an equivalent in case of negotiations for peace.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>) That the means of taking it are at hand. Small means are only
sufficient to take small places; but it is better to take a small one than =
to
fail before a large one.
</p>

<p>
(<i>c</i>) Its strength in engineering respects, which obviously is not alw=
ays
in proportion to its importance in other respects. Nothing is more absurd t=
han
to waste forces before a very strong place of little importance, if a place=
 of
less strength may be made the object of attack.
</p>

<p>
(<i>d</i>) The strength of the armament and of the garrison as well. If a
fortress is weakly armed and insufficiently garrisoned, its capture must
naturally be easier; but here we must observe that the strength of the garr=
ison
and armament, are to be reckoned amongst those things which make up the tot=
al
importance of the place, because garrison and armaments are directly parts =
of
the enemy=E2=80=99s military strength, which cannot be said in the same mea=
sure
of works of fortification. The conquest of a fortress with a strong garriso=
n
can, therefore, much more readily repay the sacrifice it costs than one wit=
h
very strong works.
</p>

<p>
(<i>e</i>) The facility of moving the siege train. Most sieges fail for wan=
t of
means, and the means are generally wanting from the difficulty attending th=
eir
transport. Eugene=E2=80=99s siege of Landreci, 1712, and Frederick the
Great=E2=80=99s siege of Olm=C3=BCtz, 1758, are very remarkable instances i=
n point.
</p>

<p>
(<i>f</i>) Lastly, there remains the facility of covering the siege as a po=
int
now to be considered.
</p>

<p>
There are two essentially different ways by which a siege may be covered: b=
y
entrenching the besieging force, that is, by a line of circumvallation, and=
 by
what is called lines of observation. The first of these methods has gone qu=
ite
out of fashion, although evidently one important point speaks in its favour=
,
namely, that by this method the force of the assailant does not suffer by
division exactly that weakening which is so generally found a great
disadvantage at sieges. But we grant there is still a weakening in another =
way,
to a very considerable degree, because=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. The position round the fortress, as a rule, is of too great extent for t=
he
strength of the army.
</p>

<p>
2. The garrison, the strength of which, added to that of the relieving army=
,
would only make up the force originally opposed to us, <i>under these
circumstances</i> is to be looked upon as an enemy=E2=80=99s corps in the m=
iddle
of our camp, which, protected by its walls, is <i>invulnerable</i>, or at l=
east
not to be overpowered, by which its power is immensely increased.
</p>

<p>
3. The defence of a line of circumvallation admits of nothing but the most
absolute defensive, because the circular order, facing outwards, is the wea=
kest
and most disadvantageous of all possible orders of battle, and is particula=
rly
unfavourable to any advantageous counter-attacks. There is no alternative, =
in
fact, but to defend ourselves to the last extremity within the entrenchment=
s.
That these circumstances may cause a greater diminution of the army than
one-third which, perhaps, would be occasioned by forming an army of
observation, is easy to conceive. If, added to that, we now think of the
general preference which has existed since the time of Frederick the Great =
for
the offensive, as it is called, (but which, in reality, is not always so) f=
or
movements and man=C5=93uvres, and the aversion to entrenchments, we shall n=
ot wonder
at lines of circumvallation having gone quite out of fashion. But this
weakening of the tactical resistance is by no means its only disadvantage; =
and
we have only reckoned up the prejudices which forced themselves into the
judgment on the lines of circumvallation next in order after that disadvant=
age,
because they are nearly akin to each other. A line of circumvallation only =
in
reality covers that portion of the theatre of war which it actually enclose=
s;
all the rest is more or less given up to the enemy if special detachments a=
re
not made use of to cover it, in which way the very partition of force which=
 it
was intended to obviate takes place. Thus the besieging army will be always=
 in
anxiety and embarrassment on account of the convoys which it requires, and =
the
covering the same by lines of circumvallation, is not to be thought of if t=
he
army and the siege supplies required are considerable, and the enemy is in =
the
field in strong force, unless under such conditions as are found in the
Netherlands, where there is a whole system of fortresses lying close to eac=
h
other, and intermediate lines connecting them, which cover the rest of the
theatre of war, and considerably shorten the lines by which transport can b=
e
affected. In the time of Louis the Fourteenth the conception of a theatre o=
f
war had not yet bound itself up with the position of an army. In the Thirty
Years=E2=80=99 War particularly, the armies moved here and there sporadical=
ly
before this or that fortress, in the neighbourhood of which there was no
enemy=E2=80=99s corps at all, and besieged it as long as the siege equipmen=
t they
had brought with them lasted, and until an enemy=E2=80=99s army approached =
to
relieve the place. Then lines of circumvallation had their foundation in th=
e
nature of circumstances.
</p>

<p>
In future it is not likely they will be often used again, unless where the
enemy in the field is very weak, or the conception of the theatre of war
vanishes before that of the siege. Then it will be natural to keep all the
forces united in the siege, as a siege by that means unquestionably gains i=
n
energy in a high degree.
</p>

<p>
The lines of circumvallation in the reign of Louis XIV., at Cambray and
Valenciennes, were of little use, as the former were stormed by Turenne,
opposed to Cond=C3=A9, the latter by Cond=C3=A9 opposed to Turenne; but we =
must not
overlook the endless number of other cases in which they were respected, ev=
en
when there existed in the place the most urgent need for relief; and when t=
he
commander on the defensive side was a man of great enterprise, as in 1708, =
when
Villars did not venture to attack the allies in their lines at Lille. Frede=
rick
the Great at Olm=C3=BCtz, 1758, and at Dresden, 1760, although he had no re=
gular
lines of circumvallation, had a system which in all essentials was identica=
l;
he used the same army to carry on the siege, and also as a covering army. T=
he
distance of the Austrian army induced him to adopt this plan at Olm=C3=BCtz=
, but the
loss of his convoy at Domst=C3=A4dtel made him repent it; at Dresden in 176=
0 the
motives which led him to this mode of proceeding, were his contempt for the
German States=E2=80=99 imperial army, and his desire to take Dresden as soo=
n as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it is a disadvantage in lines of circumvallation, that in case of a
reverse it is more difficult to save the siege train. If a defeat is sustai=
ned
at a distance of one or more days=E2=80=99 march from the place besieged, t=
he
siege may be raised before the enemy can arrive, and the heavy trains may, =
in
the mean time, gain also a day=E2=80=99s march.
</p>

<p>
In taking up a position for an army of observation, an important question t=
o be
considered is the distance at which it should be placed from the besieged
place. This question will, in most cases, be decided by the nature of the
country, or by the position of other armies or corps with which the besiege=
rs
have to remain in communication. In other respects, it is easy to see that,
with a greater distance, the siege is better covered, but that by a smaller
distance, not exceeding a few miles, the two armies are better able to affo=
rd
each other mutual support.

<h3><a name=3D"chap113"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>Attack on Convoys</h3>

<p>
The attack and defence of a convoy form a subject of tactics: we should,
therefore, have nothing to say upon the subject here if it was not necessar=
y,
first, to demonstrate generally, to a certain extent, the possibility of th=
e
thing, which can only be done from strategic motives and relations. We shou=
ld
have had to speak of it in this respect before when treating of the defence=
,
had it not been that the little which can be said about it can easily be fr=
amed
to suit for both attack and defence, while at the same time the first plays=
 the
higher part in connection with it.
</p>

<p>
A moderate convoy of three or four hundred wagons, let the load be what it =
may,
takes up half a mile, a large convoy is several miles in length. Now, how i=
s it
possible to expect that the few troops usually allotted to a convoy will
suffice for its defence? If to this difficulty we add the unwieldy nature o=
f
this mass, which can only advance at the slowest pace, and which, besides, =
is
always liable to be thrown into disorder, and lastly, that every part of a
convoy must be equally protected, because the moment that one part is attac=
ked
by the enemy, the whole is brought to a stop, and thrown into a state of
confusion, we may well ask,=E2=80=94how can the covering and defence of suc=
h a
train be possible at all? Or, in other words, why are not all convoys taken
when they are attacked, and why are not all attacked which require an escor=
t,
or, which is the same thing, all that come within reach of the enemy? It is
plain that all tactical expedients, such as Templehof=E2=80=99s most
impracticable scheme of constantly halting and assembling the convoy at sho=
rt
distances, and then moving off afresh: and the much better plan of Scharnho=
rst,
of breaking up the convoy into several columns, are only slight correctives=
 of
a radical evil.
</p>

<p>
The explanation consists in this, that by far the greater number of convoys
derive more security from the strategic situation in general, than any othe=
r
parts exposed to the attacks of the enemy, which bestows on their limited m=
eans
of defence a very much increased efficacy. Convoys generally move more or l=
ess
in rear of their own army, or, at least, at a great distance from that of t=
he
enemy. The consequence is, that only weak detachments can be sent to attack
them, and these are obliged to cover themselves by strong reserves. Added t=
o
this the unwieldiness itself of the carriages used, makes it very difficult=
 to
carry them off; the assailant must therefore, in general, content himself w=
ith
cutting the traces, taking away the horses, and blowing up powder-wagons, b=
y
which the whole is certainly detained and thrown into disorder, but not
completely lost; by all this we may perceive, that the security of such tra=
ins
lies more in these general relations than in the defensive power of its esc=
ort.
If now to all this we add the defence of the escort, which, although it can=
not
by marching resolutely against the enemy directly cover the convoy, is stil=
l
able to derange the plan of the enemy=E2=80=99s attack; then, at last, the =
attack
of a convoy, instead of appearing easy and sure of success, will appear rat=
her
difficult, and very uncertain in its result.
</p>

<p>
But there remains still a chief point, which is the danger of the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
army, or one of its corps, retaliating on the assailants of its convoy, and
punishing it ultimately for the undertaking by defeating it. The apprehensi=
on
of this, puts a stop to many undertakings, without the real cause ever
appearing; so that the safety of the convoy is attributed to the escort, an=
d
people wonder how a miserable arrangement, such as an escort, should meet w=
ith
such respect. In order to feel the truth of this observation, we have only =
to
think of the famous retreat which Frederick the Great made through Bohemia
after the siege of Olm=C3=BCtz, 1758, when the half of his army was broken =
into a
column of companies to cover a convoy of 4,000 carriages. What prevented Da=
un
from falling on this monstrosity? The fear that Frederick would throw himse=
lf
upon him with the other half of his army, and entangle him in a battle whic=
h
Daun did not desire; what prevented Laudon, who was constantly at the side =
of
that convoy, from falling upon it at Zischbowitz sooner and more boldly tha=
n he
did? The fear that he would get a rap over the knuckles. Ten miles from his
main army, and completely separated from it by the Prussian army, he though=
t
himself in danger of a serious defeat if the king, who had no reason at tha=
t
time to be concerned about Daun, should fall upon him with the bulk of his
forces.
</p>

<p>
It is only if the strategic situation of an army involves it in the unnatur=
al
necessity of connecting itself with its convoys by the flank or by its fron=
t
that then these convoys are really in great danger, and become an advantage=
ous
object of attack for the enemy, if his position allows him to detach troops=
 for
that purpose. The same campaign of 1758 affords an instance of the most
complete success of an undertaking of this description, in the capture of t=
he
convoy at Domst=C3=A4dtel. The road to Neiss lay on the left flank of the P=
russian
position, and the king=E2=80=99s forces were so neutralised by the siege an=
d by
the corps watching Daun, that the partizans had no reason to be uneasy abou=
t
themselves, and were able to make their attack completely at their ease.
</p>

<p>
When Eugene besieged Landrecy in 1712, he drew his supplies for the siege f=
rom
Bouchain by Denain; therefore, in reality, from the front of the strategic
position. It is well known what means he was obliged to use to overcome the
difficulty of protecting his convoys on that occasion, and in what
embarrassments he involved himself, ending in a complete change of
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion we draw, therefore, is that however easy an attack on a conv=
oy
may appear in its tactical aspect, still it has not much in its favour on
strategic grounds, and only promises important results in the exceptional
instances of lines of communication very much exposed.

<p>
But here, in considering the attack, we have to think of an enemy=E2=80=99s=
 army
in cantonments in all respects as a special object; for, in the first place=
,
such an attack is of a very peculiar kind in itself; and, in the next place=
, it
may be considered as a strategic means of particular efficacy. Here we have
before us, therefore, not the question of an onslaught on a single cantonme=
nt
or a small corps dispersed amongst a few villages, as the arrangements for =
that
are entirely of a tactical nature, but of the attack of a large army,
distributed in cantonments more or less extensive; an attack in which the
object is not the mere surprise of a single cantonment, but to prevent the
assembly of the army.
</p>

<p>
The attack on an enemy=E2=80=99s army in cantonments is therefore the surpr=
ise of
an army not assembled. If this surprise succeeds fully, then the enemy=E2=
=80=99s
army is prevented from reaching its appointed place of assembly, and,
therefore, compelled to choose another more to the rear; as this change of =
the
point of assembly to the rear in a state of such emergency can seldom be
effected in less than a day=E2=80=99s march, but generally will require sev=
eral
days, the loss of ground which this occasions is by no means an insignifica=
nt
loss; and this is the first advantage gained by the assailant.
</p>

<p>
But now, this surprise which is in connection with the general relations, m=
ay
certainly at the same time, in its commencement, be an onslaught on some of=
 the
enemy=E2=80=99s single cantonments, not certainly upon all, or upon a great=
 many,
because that would suppose a scattering of the attacking army to an extent
which could never be advisable. Therefore, only the most advanced quarters,
only those which lie in the direction of the attacking columns, can be
surprised, and even this will seldom happen to many of them, as large force=
s
cannot easily approach unobserved. However, this element of the attack is b=
y no
means to be disregarded; and we reckon the advantages which may be thus
obtained, as the second advantage of the surprise.
</p>

<p>
A third advantage consists in the minor combats forced upon the enemy in wh=
ich
his losses will be considerable. A great body of troops does not assemble
itself at once by single battalions at the spot appointed for the general
concentration of the army, but usually forms itself by brigades, divisions,=
 or
corps, in the first place, and these masses cannot then hasten at full spee=
d to
the rendezvous; in case of meeting with an enemy=E2=80=99s column in their
course, they are obliged to engage in a combat; now, they may certainly com=
e
off victorious in the same, particularly if the enemy=E2=80=99s attacking c=
olumn
is not of sufficient strength, but in conquering, they lose time, and, in m=
ost
cases, as may be easily conceived, a corps, under such circumstances, and i=
n
the general tendency to gain a point which lies to the rear, will not make =
any
beneficial use of its victory. On the other hand, they may be beaten, and t=
hat
is the most probable issue in itself, because they have not time to organis=
e a
good resistance. We may, therefore, very well suppose that in an attack wel=
l
planned and executed, the assailant through these partial combats will gath=
er
up a considerable number of trophies, which become a principal point in the
general result.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the fourth advantage, and the keystone of the whole, is a certain
momentary disorganisation and discouragement on the side of the enemy, whic=
h,
when the force is at last assembled, seldom allows of its being immediately
brought into action, and generally obliges the party attacked to abandon st=
ill
more ground to his assailant, and to make a change generally in his plan of
operations.
</p>

<p>
Such are the proper results of a successful surprise of the enemy in
cantonments, that is, of one in which the enemy is prevented from assemblin=
g
his army without loss at the point fixed in his plan. But by the nature of =
the
case, success has many degrees; and, therefore, the results may be very gre=
at
in one case, and hardly worth mentioning in another. But even when, through=
 the
complete success of the enterprise, these results are considerable, they wi=
ll
seldom bear comparison with the gain of a great battle, partly because, in =
the
first place, the trophies are seldom as great, and in the next, the moral
impression never strikes so deep.
</p>

<p>
This general result must always be kept in view, that we may not promise
ourselves more from an enterprise of this kind than it can give. Many hold =
it
to be the <i>non plus ultra</i> of offensive activity; but it is not so by =
any
means, as we may see from this analysis, as well as from military history.
</p>

<p>
One of the most brilliant surprises in history, is that made by the Duke of
Lorraine in 1643, on the cantonments of the French, under General Ranzan, a=
t
Duttlingen. The corps was 16,000 men, and they lost the General commanding,=
 and
7,000 men; it was a complete defeat. The want of outposts was the cause of =
the
disaster.
</p>

<p>
The surprise of Turenne at Mergentheim (Mariendal, as the French call it,) =
in
1644, is in like manner to be regarded as equal to a defeat in its effects,=
 for
he lost 3,000 men out of 8,000, which was principally owing to his having b=
een
led into making an untimely stand after he got his men assembled. Such resu=
lts
we cannot, therefore, often reckon upon; it was rather the result of an
ill-judged action than of the surprise, properly speaking, for Turenne migh=
t
easily have avoided the action, and have rallied his troops upon those in m=
ore
distant quarters.
</p>

<p>
A third noted surprise is that which Turenne made on the Allies under the g=
reat
Elector, the Imperial General Bournonville and the Duke of Lorraine, in Als=
ace,
in the year 1674. The trophies were very small, the loss of the Allies did =
not
exceed 2,000 or 3,000 men, which could not decide the fate of a force of
50,000; but the Allies considered that they could not venture to make any
further resistance in Alsace, and retired across the Rhine again. This
strategic result was all that Turenne wanted, but we must not look for the
causes of it entirely in the surprise. Turenne surprised the plans of his
opponents more than the troops themselves; the want of unanimity amongst th=
e
allied generals and the proximity of the Rhine did the rest. This event
altogether deserves a closer examination, as it is generally viewed in a wr=
ong
light.
</p>

<p>
In 1741, Neipperg surprised Frederick the Great in his quarters; the whole =
of
the result was that the king was obliged to fight the battle of Mollwitz be=
fore
he had collected all his forces, and with a change of front.
</p>

<p>
In 1745, Frederick the Great surprised the Duke of Lorraine in his cantonme=
nts
in Lusatia; the chief success was through the real surprise of one of the m=
ost
important quarters, that of Hennersdorf, by which the Austrians suffered a =
loss
of 2,000 men; the general result was that the Duke of Lorraine retreated to
Bohemia by Upper Lusatia, but that did not at all prevent his returning int=
o
Saxony by the left bank of the Elbe, so that without the battle of Kesselsd=
orf,
there would have been no important result.
</p>

<p>
1758. The Duke Ferdinand surprised the French quarters; the immediate resul=
t
was that the French lost some thousands of men, and were obliged to take up=
 a
position behind the Aller. The moral effect may have been of more importanc=
e,
and may have had some influence on the subsequent evacuation of Westphalia.
</p>

<p>
If from these different examples we seek for a conclusion as to the efficac=
y of
this kind of attack, then only the two first can be put in comparison with =
a
battle gained. But the corps were only small, and the want of outposts in t=
he
system of war in those days was a circumstance greatly in favour of these
enterprises. Although the four other cases must be reckoned completely
successful enterprises, it is plain that not one of them is to be compared =
with
a battle gained as respects its result. The general result could not have t=
aken
place in any of them except with an adversary weak in will and character, a=
nd
therefore it did not take place at all in the case of 1741.
</p>

<p>
In 1806 the Prussian army contemplated surprising the French in this manner=
 in
Franconia. The case promised well for a satisfactory result. Buonaparte was=
 not
present, the French corps were in widely extended cantonments; under these
circumstances, the Prussian army, acting with great resolution and activity=
,
might very well reckon on driving the French back across the Rhine, with mo=
re
or less loss. But this was also all; if they reckoned upon more, for instan=
ce,
on following up their advantages beyond the Rhine, or on gaining such a mor=
al
ascendancy, that the French would not again venture to appear on the right =
bank
of the river in the same campaign, such an expectation had no sufficient
grounds whatever.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning of August, 1812, the Russians from Smolensk meditated fall=
ing
upon the cantonments of the French when Napoleon halted his army in the
neighbourhood of Witepsk. But they wanted courage to carry out the enterpri=
se;
and it was fortunate for them they did; for as the French commander with hi=
s
centre was not only more than twice the strength of their centre, but also =
in
himself the most resolute commander that ever lived, as further, the loss o=
f a
few miles of ground would have decided nothing, and there was no natural
obstacle in any feature of the country near enough up to which they might
pursue their success, and by that means, in some measure make it certain, a=
nd
lastly, as the war of the year 1812 was not in any way a campaign of that k=
ind,
which draws itself in a languid way to a conclusion, but the serious plan o=
f an
assailant who had made up his mind to conquer his opponent
completely,=E2=80=94therefore the trifling results to be expected from a su=
rprise
of the enemy in his quarters, appear nothing else than utterly disproportio=
nate
to the solution of the problem, they could not justify a hope of making goo=
d by
their means the great inequality of forces and other relations. But this sc=
heme
serves to show how a confused idea of the effect of this means may lead to =
an
entirely false application of the same.
</p>

<p>
What has been hitherto said, places the subject in the light of a <i>strate=
gic
means</i>. But it lies in its nature that its execution also is not purely
tactical, but in part belongs again to strategy so far, particularly that s=
uch
an attack is generally made on a front of considerable width, and the army
which carries it out can, and generally will, come to blows before it is
concentrated, so that the whole is an agglomeration of partial combats. We =
must
now add a few words on the most natural organisation of such an attack.
</p>

<p>
The first condition is:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
(1.) To attack the front of the enemy=E2=80=99s quarters in a certain width=
 of
front, for that is the only means by which we can really surprise several
cantonments, cut off others, and create generally that disorganisation in t=
he
enemy=E2=80=99s army which is intended.=E2=80=94The number of, and the inte=
rvals
between, the columns must depend on circumstances.
</p>

<p>
(2.) The direction of the different columns must converge upon a point wher=
e it
is intended they should unite; for the enemy ends more or less with a
concentration of his force, and therefore we must do the same. This point o=
f
concentration should, if possible, be the enemy=E2=80=99s point of assembly=
, or
lie on his line of retreat, it will naturally be best where that line cross=
es
an important obstacle in the country.
</p>

<p>
(3.) The separate columns when they come in contact with the enemy=E2=80=99=
s
forces must attack them with great determination, with dash and boldness, a=
s
they have general relations in their favour, and daring is always there in =
its
right place. From this it follows that the commanders of the separate colum=
ns
must be allowed freedom of action and full power in this respect.
</p>

<p>
(4.) The tactical plan of attack against those of the enemy=E2=80=99s corps=
 that
are the first to place themselves in position, must always be directed to t=
urn
a flank, for the greatest result is always to be expected by separating the
corps, and cutting them off.
</p>

<p>
(5.) Each of the columns must be composed of portions of the three arms, an=
d
must not be stinted in cavalry, it may even sometimes be well to divide amo=
ngst
them the whole of the reserve cavalry; for it would be a great mistake to
suppose that this body of cavalry could play any great part in a mass in an
enterprise of this sort. The first village, the smallest bridge, the most
insignificant thicket would bring it to a halt.
</p>

<p>
(6.) Although it lies in the nature of a surprise that the assailant should=
 not
send his advanced guard very far in front, that principle only applies to t=
he
first approach to the enemy=E2=80=99s quarters. When the fight has commence=
d in
the enemy=E2=80=99s quarters, and therefore all that was to be expected fro=
m
actual surprise has been gained, then the columns of the advanced guard of =
all
arms should push on as far as possible, for they may greatly increase the
confusion on the side of the enemy by more rapid movement. It is only by th=
is
means that it becomes possible to carry off here and there the mass of bagg=
age,
artillery, non-effectives, and camp-followers, which have to be dragged aft=
er a
cantonment suddenly broken up, and these advanced guards must also be the c=
hief
instruments in turning and cutting off the enemy.
</p>

<p>
(7.) Finally, the retreat in case of ill-success must be thought of, and a
rallying point be fixed upon beforehand.
</p>

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap115"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br>Diversion</h3>

<p>
According to the ordinary use of language, under the term diversion is
understood such an incursion into the enemy=E2=80=99s country as draws off =
a
portion of his force from the principal point. It is only when this is the
chief end in view, and not the gain of the object which is selected as the
point of attack, that it is an enterprise of a special character, otherwise=
 it
is only an ordinary attack.
</p>

<p>
Naturally the diversion must at the same time always have an object of atta=
ck,
for it is only the value of this object that will induce the enemy to send
troops for its protection; besides, in case the undertaking does not succee=
d as
a diversion, this object is a compensation for the forces expended in the
attempt.
</p>

<p>
These objects of attack may be fortresses, or important magazines, or rich =
and
large towns, especially capital cities, contributions of all kinds; lastly,
assistance may be afforded in this way to discontented subjects of the enem=
y.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to conceive that diversions may be useful, but they certainly ar=
e
not so always; on the contrary, they are just as often injurious. The chief
condition is that they should withdraw from the principal theatre of the wa=
r
more of the enemy=E2=80=99s troops than we employ on the diversion; for if =
they
only succeed in drawing off just the same number, then their efficacy as
diversions, properly called, ceases, and the undertaking becomes a mere
subordinate attack. Even where, on account of circumstances, we have in vie=
w to
attain a very great end with a very small force, as, for instance, to make =
an
easy capture of an important fortress, and another attack is made adjoining=
 to
the principal attack, to assist the latter, that is no longer a diversion. =
When
two states are at war, and a third falls upon one of them, such an event is
very commonly called a diversion=E2=80=94but such an attack differs in noth=
ing
from an ordinary attack except in its direction; there is, therefore, no
occasion to give it a particular name, for in theory it should be a rule on=
ly
to denote by particular names such things as are in their nature distinct.
</p>

<p>
But if small forces are to attract large ones, there must obviously be some
special cause, and, therefore, for the object of a diversion it is not
sufficient merely to detach some troops to a point not hitherto occupied.
</p>

<p>
If the assailant with a small corps of 1000 men overruns one of his
enemy=E2=80=99s provinces, not belonging to the theatre of war, and levies
contribution, etc., it is easy to see beforehand that the enemy cannot put =
a
stop to this by detaching 1000 men, but that if he means to protect the
province from invaders, he must at all events send a considerably larger fo=
rce.
But it may be asked cannot a defender, instead of protecting his own provin=
ce,
restore the balance by sending a similar detachment to plunder a province i=
n
our country? Therefore, if an advantage is to be obtained by an aggressor i=
n
this way, it must first be ascertained that there is more to be got or to b=
e
threatened in the defender=E2=80=99s provinces than in his own. If this is =
the
case, then no doubt a weak diversion will occupy a force on the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
side greater than that composing the enterprise. On the other hand, this
advantage naturally diminishes as the masses increase, for 50,000 men can
defend a province of moderate extent not only against equal but even agains=
t
somewhat superior numbers. The advantage of large diversions is, therefore,
very doubtful, and the greater they become the more decisive must be the ot=
her
circumstances which favour a diversion if any good is to come out of such a=
n
enterprise upon the whole.
</p>

<p>
Now these favourable circumstances may be:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
<i>a.</i> Forces which the assailant holds available for a diversion withou=
t
weakening the great mass of his force.
</p>

<p>
<i>b.</i> Points belonging to the defender which are of vital importance to=
 him
and can be threatened by a diversion.
</p>

<p>
<i>c.</i> Discontented subjects of the same.
</p>

<p>
<i>d.</i> A rich province which can supply a considerable quantity of munit=
ions
of war.
</p>

<p>
If only these diversions are undertaken, which, when tested by these differ=
ent
considerations, promise results, it will be found that an opportunity of ma=
king
a diversion does not offer frequently.
</p>

<p>
But now comes another important point. Every diversion brings war into a
district into which the war would not otherwise have penetrated: for that
reason it will always be the means, more or less, of calling forth military
forces which would otherwise have continued in abeyance, this will be done =
in a
way which will be very sensibly felt if the enemy has any organised militia=
,
and means of arming the nation at large. It is quite in the natural order o=
f
things, and amply shown by experience, that if a district is suddenly
threatened by an enemy=E2=80=99s force, and nothing has been prepared befor=
ehand
for its defence, all the most efficient official functionaries immediately =
lay
hold of and set in motion every extraordinary means that can be imagined, i=
n
order to ward off the impending danger. Thus, new powers of resistance spri=
ng
up, such as are next to a people=E2=80=99s war, and may easily excite one.
</p>

<p>
This is a point which should be kept well in view in every diversion, in or=
der
that we may not dig our own graves.
</p>

<p>
The expeditions to North Holland in 1799, and to Walcheren in 1809, regarde=
d as
diversions, are only to be justified in so far that there was no other way =
of
employing the English troops; but there is no doubt that the sum total of t=
he
means of resistance of the French was thereby increased, and every landing =
in
France, would have just the same effect. To threaten the French coast certa=
inly
offers great advantages, because by that means an important body of troops
becomes neutralised in watching the coast, but a landing with a large force=
 can
never be justifiable unless we can count on the assistance of a province in
opposition to the Government.
</p>

<p>
The less a great decision is looked forward to in war the more will diversi=
ons
be allowable, but so much the smaller will also certainly be the gain to be
derived from them. They are only a means of bringing the stagnant masses in=
to
motion.
</p>

<p class=3D"center">
<i>Execution.</i>
</p>

<p>
1. A diversion may include in itself a real attack, then the execution has =
no
special character in itself except boldness and expedition.
</p>

<p>
2. It may also have as an object to appear more than it really is, being, i=
n
fact, a demonstration as well. The special means to be employed in such a c=
ase
can only suggest themselves to a subtil mind well versed in men and in the
existing state of circumstances. It follows from the nature of the thing th=
at
there must be a great fractioning of forces on such occasions.
</p>

<p>
3. If the forces employed are not quite inconsiderable, and the retreat is
restricted to certain points, then a reserve on which the whole may rally i=
s an
essential condition.

<h3><a name=3D"chap116"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br>Invasion</h3>

<p>
Almost all that we have to say on this subject consists in an explanation o=
f
the term. We find the expression very frequently used by modern authors and
also that they pretend to denote by it something particular. <i>Guerre
d=E2=80=99invasion</i> occurs perpetually in French authors. They use it as=
 a term
for every attack which enters deep into the enemy=E2=80=99s country, and pe=
rhaps
sometimes mean to apply it as the antithesis to methodical attack, that is,=
 one
which only nibbles at the frontier. But this is a very unphilosophical
confusion of language. Whether an attack is to be confined to the frontier =
or
to be carried into the heart of the country, whether it shall make the seiz=
ure
of the enemy=E2=80=99s strong places the chief object, or seek out the core=
 of
the enemy=E2=80=99s power, and pursue it unremittingly, is the result of
circumstances, and not dependent on a system. In some cases, to push forwar=
d
may be more methodical, and at the same time more prudent than to tarry on =
the
frontier, but in most cases it is nothing else than just the fortunate resu=
lt
of a vigorous <i>attack</i>, and consequently does not differ from it in an=
y respect.

</p>

<p>
The conqueror in a war is not always in a condition to subdue his adversary
completely. Often, in fact, almost universally, there is a culminating poin=
t of
victory. Experience shows this sufficiently; but as the subject is one
especially important for the theory of war, and the pivot of almost all pla=
ns
of campaigns, while, at the same time, on its surface some apparent
contradictions glitter, as in ever-changing colours, we therefore wish to
examine it more closely, and look for its essential causes.
</p>

<p>
Victory, as a rule, springs from a preponderance of the sum of all the phys=
ical
and moral powers combined; undoubtedly it increases this preponderance, or =
it
would not be sought for and purchased at a great sacrifice. Victory
<i>itself</i> does this unquestionably; also its consequences have the same
effect, but not to the utmost point generally only up to a certain point. T=
his
point may be very near at hand, and is sometimes so near that the whole of =
the
results of a victorious battle are confined to an increase of the moral
superiority. How this comes about we have now to examine.
</p>

<p>
In the progress of action in war, the combatant force is incessantly meetin=
g
with elements which strengthen it, and others which weaken it. Hence it is =
a
question of superiority on one side or the other. As every diminution of po=
wer
on one side is to be regarded as an increase on the opposite, it follows, o=
f
course, that this double current, this ebb and flow, takes place whether tr=
oops
are advancing or retiring.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore necessary to find out the principal cause of this alteratio=
n in
the one case to determine the other along with it.
</p>

<p>
In advancing, the most important causes of the <i>increase of strength</i>
which the assailant gains, are:
</p>

<p>
1. The loss which the enemy=E2=80=99s army suffers, because it is usually g=
reater
than that of the assailant.
</p>

<p>
2. The loss which the enemy suffers in inert military means, such as magazi=
nes,
dep=C3=B4ts, bridges, etc., and which the assailant does not share with him=
.
</p>

<p>
3. That from the moment the assailant enters the enemy=E2=80=99s territory,=
 there
is a loss of provinces to the defence, consequently of the sources of new
military forces.
</p>

<p>
4. That the advancing army gains a portion of those resources, in other wor=
ds,
gains the advantage of living at the expense of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
5. The loss of internal organisation and of the regular action of everythin=
g on
the side of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
6. That the allies of the enemy secede from him, and others join the conque=
ror.
</p>

<p>
7. Lastly, the discouragement of the enemy who lets the arms, in some measu=
re,
drop out of his hands.
</p>

<p>
The causes of <i>decrease of strength</i> in an army advancing, are:
</p>

<p>
1. That it is compelled to lay siege to the enemy=E2=80=99s fortresses, to
blockade them or observe them; or that the enemy, who did the same before t=
he
victory, in his retreat draws in these corps on his main body.
</p>

<p>
2. That from the moment the assailant enters the enemy=E2=80=99s territory,=
 the
nature of the theatre of war is changed; it becomes hostile; we must occupy=
 it,
for we cannot call any portion our own beyond what is in actual occupation,=
 and
yet it everywhere presents difficulties to the whole machine, which must
necessarily tend to weaken its effects.
</p>

<p>
3. That we are removing further away from our resources, whilst the enemy i=
s
drawing nearer to his; this causes a delay in the replacement of expended
power.
</p>

<p>
4. That the danger which threatens the state, rouses other powers to its
protection.
</p>

<p>
5. Lastly, the greater efforts of the adversary, in consequence of the
increased danger, on the other hand, a relaxation of effort on the side of =
the
victorious state.
</p>

<p>
All these advantages and disadvantages can exist together, meet each other =
in a
certain measure, and pursue their way in opposite directions, except that t=
he
last meet as real opposites, cannot pass, therefore mutually exclude each
other. This alone shows how infinitely different may be the effect of a vic=
tory
according as it stuns the vanquished or stimulates him to greater exertions=
.
</p>

<p>
We shall now try to characterise, in a few words, each of these points sing=
ly.
</p>

<p>
1. The loss of the enemy when defeated, may be at the greatest in the first
moment of defeat, and then daily diminish in amount until it arrives at a p=
oint
where the balance is restored as regards our force; but it may go on increa=
sing
every day in an ascending ratio. The difference of situation and relations
determines this. We can only say that, in general, with a good army the fir=
st
will be the case, with an indifferent army the second; next to the spirit o=
f
the army, the spirit of the Government is here the most important thing. It=
 is
of great consequence in war to distinguish between the two cases in practic=
e,
in order not to stop just at the point where we ought to begin in good earn=
est,
and <i>vice vers=C3=A2</i>.
</p>

<p>
2. The loss which the enemy sustains in that part of the apparatus of war w=
hich
is inert, may ebb and flow just in the same manner, and this will depend on=
 the
accidental position and nature of the dep=C3=B4ts from which supplies are d=
rawn.
This subject, however, in the present day, cannot be compared with the othe=
rs
in point of importance.
</p>

<p>
3. The third advantage must necessarily increase as the army advances; inde=
ed,
it may be said that it does not come into consideration until an army has
penetrated far into the enemy=E2=80=99s country; that is to say, until a th=
ird or
a fourth of the country has been left in rear. In addition, the intrinsic v=
alue
which a province has in connection with the war comes also into considerati=
on.
</p>

<p>
In the same way the fourth advantage should increase with the advance.
</p>

<p>
But with respect to these two last, it is also to be observed that their
influence on the combatant powers actually engaged in the struggle, is seld=
om
felt so immediately; they only work slowly and by a circuitous course;
therefore we should not bend the bow too much on their account, that is to =
say,
not place ourselves in any dangerous position.
</p>

<p>
The fifth advantage, again, only comes into consideration if we have made a
considerable advance, and if by the form of the enemy=E2=80=99s country som=
e
provinces can be detached from the principal mass, as these, like limbs
compressed by ligatures, usually soon die off.
</p>

<p>
As to six and seven, it is at least probable that they increase with the
advance; furthermore, we shall return to them hereafter. Let us now pass on=
 to
the causes of weakness.
</p>

<p>
1. The besieging, blockade, and investment of fortresses, generally increas=
e as
the army advances. This weakening influence alone acts so powerfully on the
<i>condition of the combatant force</i>, that it may soon outweigh all the
advantages gained. No doubt, in modern times, a system has been introduced =
of
blockading places with a small number of troops, or of watching them with a
still smaller number; and also the enemy must keep garrisons in them.
Nevertheless, they remain a great element of security. The garrisons consis=
t
very often in half of people, who have taken no part in the war previously.
Before those places which are situated near the line of communication, it i=
s
necessary for the assailant to leave a force at least double the strength o=
f
the garrison; and if it is desirable to lay formal siege to, or to starve o=
ut,
one single considerable place, a small army is required for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
2. The second cause, the taking up a theatre of war in the enemy=E2=80=99s
country, increases necessarily with the advance, and if it does not further
weaken the condition of the combatant force at the moment, it does so at al=
l
events in the long run.
</p>

<p>
We can only regard as our theatre of war, so much of the enemy=E2=80=99s co=
untry
as we actually possess; that is to say, where we either have small corps in=
 the
field, or where we have left here and there strong garrisons in large towns=
, or
stations along the roads, etc.; now, however small the garrisons may be whi=
ch
are detached, still they weaken the combatant force considerably. But this =
is
the smallest evil.
</p>

<p>
Every army has strategic flanks, that is, the country which borders both si=
des
of its lines of communications; the weakness of these parts is not sensibly
felt as long as the enemy is similarly situated with respect to his. But th=
at
can only be the case as long as we are in our own country; as soon as we ge=
t
into the enemy=E2=80=99s country, the weakness of these parts is felt very =
much,
because the smallest enterprise promises some result when directed against =
a
long line only feebly, or not all, covered; and these attacks may be made f=
rom
any quarter in an enemy=E2=80=99s country.
</p>

<p>
The further we advance, the longer these flanks become, and the danger aris=
ing
from them is enhanced in an increased ratio, for not only are they difficul=
t to
cover, but the spirit of enterprise is also first roused in the enemy, chie=
fly
by long insecure lines of communication, and the consequences which their l=
oss
may entail in case of a retreat are matter of grave consideration.
</p>

<p>
All this contributes to place a fresh load on an advancing army at every st=
ep
of its progress; so that if it has not commenced with a more than ordinary
superiority, it will feel itself always more and more cramped in its plans,
gradually weakened in its impulsive force, and at last in a state of
uncertainty and anxiety as to its situation.
</p>

<p>
3. The third cause, the distance from the source from which the incessantly
diminishing combatant force is to be just as incessantly filled up, increas=
es
with the advance. A conquering army is like the light of a lamp in this
respect; the more the oil which feeds it sinks in the reservoir and recedes
from the focus of light, the smaller the light becomes, until at length it =
is
quite extinguished.
</p>

<p>
The richness of the conquered provinces may certainly diminish this evil ve=
ry
much, but can never entirely remove it, because there are always a number o=
f
things which can only be supplied to the army from its own country, men in
particular; because the subsidies furnished by the enemy's country are, in =
most
cases, neither so promptly nor so surely forthcoming as in our own country;
because the means of meeting any unexpected requirement cannot be so quickl=
y
procured; because misunderstandings and mistakes of all kinds cannot so soo=
n be
discovered and remedied.
</p>

<p>
If a prince does not lead his army in person, as became the custom in the l=
ast
wars, if he is not anywhere near it, then another and very great inconvenie=
nce
arises in the loss of time occasioned by communications backwards and forwa=
rds;
for the fullest powers conferred on a commander of an army, are never
sufficient to meet every case in the wide expanse of his activity.
</p>

<p>
4. The change in political alliances. If these changes, produced by a victo=
ry,
should be such as are disadvantageous to the conqueror, they will probably =
be
so in a direct relation to his progress, just as is the case if they are of=
 an
advantageous nature. This all depends on the existing political alliances,
interests, customs, and tendencies, on princes, ministers, etc. In general,=
 we
can only say that when a great state which has smaller allies is conquered,
these usually secede very soon from their alliance, so that the victor, in =
this
respect, with every blow becomes stronger; but if the conquered state is sm=
all,
protectors much sooner present themselves when his very existence is
threatened, and others, who have helped to place him in his present
embarrassment, will turn round to prevent his complete downfall.
</p>

<p>
5. The increased resistance on the part of the enemy which is called forth.
Sometimes the enemy drops his weapon out of his hands from terror and
stupefaction; sometimes an enthusiastic paroxysm seizes him, every one runs=
 to
arms, and the resistance is much stronger after the first defeat than it wa=
s
before. The character of the people and of the Government, the nature of th=
e
country and its political alliances, are here the data from which the proba=
ble
effect must be conjectured.
</p>

<p>
What countless differences these two last points alone make in the plans wh=
ich
may and should be made in war in one case and another? Whilst one, through =
an
excess of caution, and what is called methodical proceedings, fritters away=
 his
good fortune, another, from a want of rational reflection, tumbles into
destruction.
</p>

<p>
In addition, we must here call to mind the supineness, which not unfrequent=
ly
comes over the victorious side, when danger is removed; whilst, on the
contrary, renewed efforts are then required in order to follow up the succe=
ss.
If we cast a general glance over these different and antagonistic principle=
s,
the deduction, doubtless is, that the profitable use of the onward march in=
 a
war of aggression, in the generality of cases, diminishes the preponderance
with which the assailant set out, or which has been gained by victory.
</p>

<p>
Here the question must naturally strike us; if this be so, what is it which
impels the conqueror to follow up the career of victory to continue the
offensive? And can this really be called making further use of the victory?
Would it not be better to stop where as yet there is hardly any diminution =
of
the preponderance gained?
</p>

<p>
To this we must naturally answer: the preponderance of combatant forces is =
only
the means, not the end. The end or object is to subdue the enemy, or at lea=
st
to take from him part of his territory, in order thus to put ourselves in a
condition to realize the value of the advantages we have gained when we
conclude a peace. Even if our aim is to conquer the enemy completely, we mu=
st
be content that, perhaps, every step we advance, reduces our preponderance,=
 but
it does not necessarily follow from this that it will be nil before the fal=
l of
the enemy: the fall of the enemy may take place before that, and if it is t=
o be
obtained by the last minimum of preponderance, it would be an error not to
expend it for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
The preponderance which we have or acquire in war is, therefore, the means,=
 not
the end, and it must be staked to gain the latter. But it is necessary to k=
now
how far it will reach, in order not to go beyond that point, and instead of
fresh advantages, to reap disaster.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to introduce special examples from experience in order =
to
prove that this is the way in which the strategic preponderance exhausts it=
self
in the strategic attack; it is rather the multitude of instances which has
forced us to investigate the causes of it. It is only since the appearance =
of
Buonaparte that we have known campaigns between civilized nations, in which=
 the
preponderance has led, without interruption, to the fall of the enemy; befo=
re
his time, every campaign ended with the victorious army seeking to win a po=
int
where it could simply maintain itself in a state of equilibrium. At this po=
int,
the movement of victory stopped, even if a retreat did not become necessary=
.
Now, this culminating point of victory will also appear in the future, in a=
ll
wars in which the overthrow of the enemy is not the military object of the =
war;
and the generality of wars will still be of this kind. The natural aim of a=
ll
single plans of campaigns is the point at which the offensive changes into =
the
defensive.
</p>

<p>
But now, to overstep this point, is more than simply a <i>useless</i>
expenditure of power, yielding no further result, it is a <i>destructive</i=
>
step which causes reaction; and this re-action is, according to all general
experience, productive of most disproportionate effects. This last fact is =
so
common, and appears so natural and easy to understand that we need not ente=
r
circumstantially into the causes. Want of organisation in the conquered lan=
d,
and the very opposite effect which a serious loss instead of the looked-for
fresh victory makes on the feelings, are the chief causes in every case. Th=
e
moral forces, courage on the one side rising often to <i>audacity</i>, and
extreme depression on the other, now begin generally their active play. The
losses on the retreat are increased thereby, and the hitherto successful pa=
rty
now generally thanks providence if he can escape with only the surrender of=
 all
his gains, without losing some of his own territory.
</p>

<p>
We must now clear up an apparent contradiction.
</p>

<p>
It may be generally supposed that as long as progress in the attack continu=
es,
there must still be a preponderance; and, that as the defensive, which will
commence at the end of the victorious career, is a stronger form of war tha=
n
the offensive, therefore, there is so much the less danger of becoming
unexpectedly the weaker party. But yet there is, and keeping history in vie=
w,
we must admit that the greatest danger of a reverse is often just at the mo=
ment
when the offensive ceases and passes into the defensive. We shall try to fi=
nd
the cause of this.
</p>

<p>
The superiority which we have attributed to the defensive form of war consi=
sts:
</p>

<p>
1. In the use of ground.
</p>

<p>
2. In the possession of a prepared theatre of war.
</p>

<p>
3. In the support of the people.
</p>

<p>
4. In the advantage of the state of expectancy.
</p>

<p>
It must be evident that these principles cannot always be forthcoming and
active in a like degree; that, consequently, one defence is not always like
another; and therefore, also, that the defence will not always have this sa=
me
superiority over the offensive. This must be particularly the case in a
defensive, which commences after the exhaustion of an offensive, and has it=
s
theatre of war usually situated at the apex of an offensive triangle thrust=
 far
forward into the country. Of the four principles above named, this defensiv=
e
only enjoys the first the use of the ground undiminished, the second genera=
lly
vanishes altogether, the third becomes negative, and the fourth is very muc=
h
reduced. A few more words, only by way of explanation, respecting the last.
</p>

<p>
If the imagined equilibrium, under the influence of which whole campaigns h=
ave
often passed without any results, because the side which should assume the
initiative is wanting in the necessary resolution, and just therein lies, a=
s we
conceive, the advantage of the state of expectancy if this equilibrium is
disturbed by an offensive act, the enemy=E2=80=99s interests damaged, and h=
is
will stirred up to action, then the probability of his remaining in a state=
 of
indolent irresolution is much diminished. A defence, which is organised on
conquered territory, has a much more irritating character than one upon our=
 own
soil; the offensive principle is engrafted on it in a certain measure, and =
its
nature is thereby weakened. The quiet which Daun allowed Frederick II. in
Silesia and Saxony, he would never have granted him in Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
Thus it is clear that the defensive, which is interwoven or mixed up with a=
n
offensive undertaking, is weakened in all its chief principles; and, theref=
ore,
will no longer have the preponderance which belongs to it originally.
</p>

<p>
As no defensive campaign is composed of purely defensive elements, so likew=
ise
no offensive campaign is made up entirely of offensive elements; because,
besides the short intervals in every campaign, in which both armies are on =
the
defensive, every attack which does not lead to a peace, must necessarily en=
d in
a defensive.
</p>

<p>
In this manner it is the defensive itself which contributes to the weakenin=
g of
the offensive. This is so far from being an idle subtlety, that on the
contrary, we consider it a chief disadvantage of the attack that we are
afterwards reduced through it to a very disadvantageous defensive.
</p>

<p>
And this explains how the difference which originally exists between the
strength of the offensive and defensive forms in war is gradually reduced. =
We
shall now show how it may completely disappear, and the advantage for a sho=
rt
time may change into the reverse.
</p>

<p>
If we may be allowed to make use of an idea from nature, we shall be able
sooner to explain ourselves. It is the time which every force in the materi=
al
world requires to show its effect. A power, which if applied slowly by degr=
ees,
would be sufficient to check a body in motion, will be overcome by it if ti=
me
fails. This law of the material world is a striking illustration of many of=
 the
phenomena in our inner life. If we are once roused to a certain train of
thought, it is not every motive sufficient in itself which can change or st=
op
that current of thought. Time, tranquillity and durable impressions on our
senses are required. So it is also in war. When once the mind has taken a
decided direction towards an object, or turned back towards a harbour of
refuge, it may easily happen that the motives which in the one base natural=
ly
serve to restrain, and those which in the other as naturally excite to
enterprise, are not felt at once in their full force; and as the progress o=
f
action in the mean time continues, one is carried along by the stream of
movement beyond the line of equilibrium, beyond the culminating point, with=
out
being aware of it. Indeed, it may even happen that, in spite of the exhaust=
ion
of force, the assailant, supported by the moral forces which specially lie =
in
the offensive, like a horse drawing a load uphill, finds it less difficult =
to
advance than to stop. By this, we believe, we have now shown, without
contradiction in itself, how the assailant may pass that point, where, if h=
e
had stopped at the right moment, he might still, through the defensive, hav=
e
had a result, that is equilibrium. Rightly to determine this point is,
therefore, important in framing a plan of a campaign, as well for the
offensive, that he may not undertake what is beyond his powers (to a certai=
n
extent contract debts), as for the defensive, that he may perceive and prof=
it
by this error if committed by the assailant.
</p>

<p>
If now we look back at all the points which the commander should bear in mi=
nd
in making his determination, and remember that he can only estimate the
tendency and value of the most important of them through the consideration =
of
many other near and distant relations, that he must to a certain extent
<i>guess</i> at them guess whether the enemy=E2=80=99s army, after the firs=
t
blow, will show a stronger core and increasing solidity, or like a Bologna
phial, will turn into dust as soon as the surface is injured; guess the ext=
ent
of weakness and prostration which the drying up of certain sources, the
interruption of certain communications will produce on the military state o=
f
the enemy; guess whether the enemy, from the burning pain of the blow which=
 has
been dealt him, will collapse powerless, or whether, like a wounded bull, h=
e
will rise to a state of fury; lastly, guess whether other powers will be
dismayed or roused, what political alliances are likely to be dissolved, an=
d
what are likely to be formed. When we say that he must hit all this, and mu=
ch
more, with the tact of his judgment, as the rifleman hits a mark, it must b=
e
admitted that such an act of the human mind is no trifle. A thousand wrong
roads running here and there, present themselves to the judgment; and whate=
ver
the number, the confusion and complexity of objects leaves undone, is compl=
eted
by the sense of danger and responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Thus it happens that the majority of generals prefer to fall short of the m=
ark
rather than to approach too close; and thus it happens that a fine courage =
and
great spirit of enterprise often go beyond the point, and therefore also fa=
il
to hit the mark. Only he that does great things with small means has made a
successful hit.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap118"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In the chapter on the essence and object of war, we sketched, in a certain
measure, its general conception, and pointed out its relations to surroundi=
ng
circumstances, in order to commence with a sound fundamental idea. We there
cast a glance at the manifold difficulties which the mind encounters in the
consideration of this subject, whilst we postponed the closer examination o=
f
them, and stopped at the conclusion, that the overthrow of the enemy,
consequently the destruction of his combatant force, is the chief object of=
 the
whole of the action of war. This put us in a position to show in the follow=
ing
chapter, that the means which the act of war employs is the combat alone. I=
n
this manner, we think, we have obtained at the outset a correct point of vi=
ew.
</p>

<p>
Having now gone through singly all the principal relations and forms which
appear in military action, but are extraneous to, or outside of, the combat=
, in
order that we might fix more distinctly their value, partly through the nat=
ure
of the thing, partly from the lessons of experience which military history
affords, purify them from, and root out, those vague ambiguous ideas which =
are
generally mixed up with them, and also to put prominently forward the real
object of the act of war, the destruction of the enemy=E2=80=99s combatant =
force
as the primary object universally belonging to it; we now return to War as =
a
whole, as we propose to speak of the Plan of War, and of campaigns; and tha=
t
obliges us to revert to the ideas in our first book
</p>

<p>
In these chapters, which are to deal with the whole question, is contained
strategy, properly speaking, in its most comprehensive and important featur=
es.
We enter this innermost part of its domain, where all other threads meet, n=
ot
without a degree of diffidence, which, indeed, is amply justified
</p>

<p>
If, on the one hand, we see how extremely simple the operations of war appe=
ar;
if we hear and read how the greatest generals speak of it, just in the plai=
nest
and briefest manner, how the government and management of this ponderous
machine, with its hundred thousand limbs, is made no more of in their lips =
than
if they were only speaking of their own persons, so that the whole tremendo=
us
act of war is individualised into a kind of duel; if we find the motives al=
so
of their action brought into connection sometimes with a few simple ideas,
sometimes with some excitement of feeling; if we see the easy, sure, we mig=
ht
almost say light manner, in which they treat the subject and now see, on th=
e
other hand, the immense number of circumstances which present themselves fo=
r
the consideration of the mind; the long, often indefinite, distances to whi=
ch
the threads of the subject run out, and the number of combinations which li=
e
before us; if we reflect that it is the duty of theory to embrace all this
systematically, that is with clearness and fullness, and always to refer th=
e
action to the necessity of a sufficient cause, then comes upon us an
overpowering dread of being dragged down to a pedantic dogmatism, to crawl
about in the lower regions of heavy abstruse conceptions, where we shall ne=
ver
meet any great captain, with his natural coup d=E2=80=99=C5=93il. If the re=
sult of an
attempt at theory is to be of this kind, it would have been as well, or rat=
her,
it would have been better, not to have made the attempt; it could only brin=
g
down on theory the contempt of genius, and the attempt itself would soon be
forgotten. And on the other hand, this facile coup d=E2=80=99=C5=93il of th=
e general,
this simple art of forming notions, this personification of the whole actio=
n of
war, is so entirely and completely the soul of the right method of conducti=
ng
war, that in no other but this broad way is it possible to conceive that
freedom of the mind which is indispensable if it is to dominate events, not=
 to
be overpowered by them
</p>

<p>
With some fear we proceed again; we can only do so by pursuing the way whic=
h we
have prescribed for ourselves from the first. Theory ought to throw a clear
light on the mass of objects, that the mind may the easier find its bearing=
s;
theory ought to pull up the weeds which error has sown broadcast; it should
show the relations of things to each other, separate the important from the
trifling. Where ideas resolve themselves spontaneously into such a core of
Truth as is called Principle, when they of themselves keep such a line as f=
orms
a rule, Theory should indicate the same
</p>

<p>
Whatever the mind seizes, the rays of light which are awakened in it by thi=
s
exploration amongst the fundamental notions of things, <i>that is the
assistance which Theory affords the mind</i>. Theory can give no formulas w=
ith
which to solve problems; it cannot confine the mind=E2=80=99s course to the
narrow line of necessity by Principles set up on both sides. It lets the mi=
nd
take a look at the mass of objects and their relations, and then allows it =
to
go free to the higher regions of action, there to act according to the meas=
ure
of its natural forces, with the energy of the whole of those forces combine=
d,
and to grasp the True and the Right, as one single clear idea, which shooti=
ng
forth from under the united pressure of all these forces, would seem to be
rather a product of feeling than of reflection.

<h3><a name=3D"chap119"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>Absolute and Real War</h3>

<p>
The Plan of the War comprehends the whole Military Act; through it that Act
becomes a whole, which must have one final determinate object, in which all
particular objects must become absorbed. No war is commenced, or, at least,=
 no
war should be commenced, if people acted wisely, without saying to themselv=
es,
What is to be attained by and in the same; the first is the final object; t=
he
other is the intermediate aim. By this chief consideration the whole course=
 of
the war is prescribed, the extent of the means and the measure of energy ar=
e
determined; its influence manifests itself down to the smallest organ of
action.
</p>

<p>
We said, in the first chapter, that the overthrow of the enemy is the natur=
al
end of the act of War; and that if we would keep within the strictly
philosophical limits of the idea, there can be no other in reality.
</p>

<p>
As this idea must apply to both the belligerent parties, it must follow, th=
at
there can be no suspension in the Military Act, and peace cannot take place
until one or other of the parties concerned is overthrown.
</p>

<p>
In the chapter on the suspension of the Belligerent Act, we have shown how =
the
simple principle of hostility applied to its embodiment, man, and all
circumstances out of which it makes a war, is subject to checks and
modifications from causes which are inherent in the apparatus of war.
</p>

<p>
But this modification is not nearly sufficient to carry us from the origina=
l
conception of War to the concrete form in which it almost everywhere appear=
s.
Most wars appear only as an angry feeling on both sides, under the influenc=
e of
which, each side takes up arms to protect himself, and to put his adversary=
 in
fear, and=E2=80=94when opportunity offers, to strike a blow. They are, ther=
efore,
not like mutually destructive elements brought into collision, but like
tensions of two elements still apart which discharge themselves in small
partial shocks.
</p>

<p>
But what is now the non-conducting medium which hinders the complete discha=
rge?
Why is the philosophical conception not satisfied? That medium consists in =
the
number of interests, forces, and circumstances of various kinds, in the
existence of the State, which are affected by the war, and through the infi=
nite
ramifications of which the logical consequence cannot be carried out as it
would on the simple threads of a few conclusions; in this labyrinth it stic=
ks
fast, and man, who in great things as well as in small, usually acts more o=
n
the impulse of ideas and feelings, than according to strictly logical
conclusions, is hardly conscious of his confusion, unsteadiness of purpose,=
 and
inconsistency.
</p>

<p>
But if the intelligence by which the war is decreed, could even go over all
these things relating to the war, without for a moment losing sight of its =
aim,
still all the other intelligences in the State which are concerned may not =
be
able to do the same; thus an opposition arises, and with that comes the
necessity for a force capable of overcoming the inertia of the whole
mass=E2=80=94a force which is seldom forthcoming to the full.
</p>

<p>
This inconsistency takes place on one or other of the two sides, or it may =
be
on both sides, and becomes the cause of the war being something quite diffe=
rent
to what it should be, according to the conception of it=E2=80=94a half and =
half
production, a thing without a perfect inner cohesion.
</p>

<p>
This is how we find it almost everywhere, and we might doubt whether our no=
tion
of its absolute character or nature was founded in reality, if we had not s=
een
real warfare make its appearence in this absolute completeness just in our =
own
times. After a short introduction performed by the French Revolution, the
impetuous Buonaparte quickly brought it to this point Under him it was carr=
ied
on without slackening for a moment until the enemy was prostrated, and the
counter stroke followed almost with as little remission. Is it not natural =
and
necessary that this phenomenon should lead us back to the original concepti=
on
of war with all its rigorous deductions?
</p>

<p>
Shall we now rest satisfied with this idea, and judge of all wars according=
 to
it, however much they may differ from it,=E2=80=94deduce from it all the
requirements of theory?
</p>

<p>
We must decide upon this point, for we can say nothing trustworthy on the P=
lan
of War until we have made up our minds whether war should only be of this k=
ind,
or whether it may be of another kind.
</p>

<p>
If we give an affirmative to the first, then our Theory will be, in all
respects, nearer to the necessary, it will be a clearer and more settled th=
ing.
But what should we say then of all wars since those of Alexander up to the =
time
of Buonaparte, if we except some campaigns of the Romans? We should have to
reject them in a lump, and yet we cannot, perhaps, do so without being asha=
med
of our presumption. But an additional evil is, that we must say to ourselve=
s,
that in the next ten years there may perhaps be a war of that same kind aga=
in,
in spite of our Theory; and that this Theory, with a rigorous logic, is sti=
ll
quite powerless against the force of circumstances. We must, therefore, dec=
ide
to construe war as it is to be, and not from pure conception, but by allowi=
ng
room for everything of a foreign nature which mixes up with it and fastens
itself upon it=E2=80=94all the natural inertia and friction of its parts, t=
he
whole of the inconsistency, the vagueness and hesitation (or timidity) of t=
he
human mind: we shall have to grasp the idea that war, and the form which we
give it, proceeds from ideas, feelings, and circumstances, which dominate f=
or
the moment; indeed, if we would be perfectly candid we must admit that this=
 has
even been the case where it has taken its absolute character, that is, unde=
r
Buonaparte.
</p>

<p>
If we must do so, if we must grant that war originates and takes its form n=
ot
from a final adjustment of the innumerable relations with which it is
connected, but from some amongst them which happen to predominate; then it
follows, as a matter of course, that it rests upon a play of possibilities,
probabilities, good fortune and bad, in which rigorous logical deduction of=
ten
gets lost, and in which it is in general a useless, inconvenient instrument=
 for
the head; then it also follows that war may be a thing which is sometimes w=
ar
in a greater, sometimes in a lesser degree.
</p>

<p>
All this, theory must admit, but it is its duty to give the foremost place =
to
the absolute form of war, and to use that form as a general point of direct=
ion,
that whoever wishes to learn something from theory, may accustom himself ne=
ver
to lose sight of it, to regard it as the natural measure of all his hopes a=
nd
fears, in order to approach it <i>where he can, or where he must</i>.
</p>

<p>
That a leading idea, which lies at the root of our thoughts and actions, gi=
ves
them a certain tone and character, even when the immediately determining
grounds come from totally different regions, is just as certain as that the
painter can give this or that tone to his picture by the colours with which=
 he
lays on his ground.
</p>

<p>
Theory is indebted to the last wars for being able to do this effectually n=
ow.
Without these warning examples of the destructive force of the element set
free, she might have talked herself hoarse to no purpose; no one would have
believed possible what all have now lived to see realised.
</p>

<p>
Would Prussia have ventured to penetrate into France in the year 1798 with
70,000 men, if she had foreseen that the reaction in case of failure would =
be
so strong as to overthrow the old balance of power in Europe?
</p>

<p>
Would Prussia, in 1806, have made war with 100,000 against France, if she h=
ad
supposed that the first pistol shot would be a spark in the heart of the mi=
ne,
which would blow it into the air?

<h3><a name=3D"chap120"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>A. Interdependence of the Parts=
 in War</h3>

<p>
According as we have in view the absolute form of war, or one of the real f=
orms
deviating more or less from it, so likewise different notions of its result
will arise.
</p>

<p>
In the absolute form, where everything is the effect of its natural and
necessary cause, one thing follows another in rapid succession; there is, i=
f we
may use the expression, no neutral space; there is on account of the manifo=
ld
reactionary effects which war contains in itself,(*1) on account of the
connection in which, strictly speaking, the whole series of combats,(*2) fo=
llow
one after another, on account of the culminating point which every victory =
has,
beyond which losses and defeats commence(*3) on account of all these natura=
l
relations of war there is, I say, only <i>one result</i>, to wit, the <i>fi=
nal
result</i>. Until it takes place nothing is decided, nothing won, nothing l=
ost.
Here we may say indeed: the end crowns the work. In this view, therefore, w=
ar
is an indivisible whole, the parts of which (the subordinate results) have =
no
value except in their relation to this whole. The conquest of Moscow, and o=
f
half Russia in 1812, was of no value to Buonaparte unless it obtained for h=
im
the peace which he desired. But it was only a part of his Plan of campaign;=
 to
complete that Plan, one part was still wanted, the destruction of the Russi=
an
army; if we suppose this, added to the other success, then the peace was as
certain as it is possible for things of this kind to be. This second part
Buonaparte missed at the right time, and he could never afterwards attain i=
t,
and so the whole of the first part was not only useless, but fatal to him.

</p>

<p>
To this view of the relative connection of results in war, which may be
regarded as extreme, stands opposed another extreme, according to which war=
 is
composed of single independent results, in which, as in any number of games
played, the preceding has no influence on the next following; everything he=
re,
therefore, depends only on the sum total of the results, and we can lay up =
each
single one like a counter at play.
</p>

<p>
Just as the first kind of view derives its truth from the nature of things,=
 so
we find that of the second in history. There are cases without number in wh=
ich
a small moderate advantage might have been gained without any very onerous
condition being attached to it. The more the element of war is modified the
more common these cases become; but as little as the first of the views now
imagined was ever completely realised in any war, just as little is there a=
ny
war in which the last suits in all respects, and the first can be dispensed
with.
</p>

<p>
If we keep to the first of these supposed views, we must perceive the neces=
sity
of every war being looked upon as a whole from the very commencement, and t=
hat
at the very first step forwards, the commander should have in his eye the
object to which every line must converge.
</p>

<p>
If we admit the second view, then subordinate advantages may be pursued on
their own account, and the rest left to subsequent events.
</p>

<p>
As neither of these forms of conception is entirely without result, therefo=
re
theory cannot dispense with either. But it makes this difference in the use=
 of
them, that it requires the first to be laid as a fundamental idea at the ro=
ot
of everything, and that the latter shall only be used as a modification whi=
ch
is justified by circumstances.
</p>

<p>
If Frederick the Great in the years 1742, 1744, 1757, and 1758, thrust out =
from
Silesia and Saxony a fresh offensive point into the Austrian Empire, which =
he
knew very well could not lead to a new and durable conquest like that of
Silesia and Saxony, it was done not with a view to the overthrow of the
Austrian Empire, but from a lesser motive, namely, to gain time and strengt=
h;
and it was optional with him to pursue that subordinate object without bein=
g
afraid that he should thereby risk his whole existence.(*) But if Prussia i=
n
1806, and Austria in 1805, 1809, proposed to themselves a still more modera=
te
object, that of driving the French over the Rhine, they would not have acte=
d in
a reasonable manner if they had not first scanned in their minds the whole
series of events which either, in the case of success, or of the reverse, w=
ould
probably follow the first step, and lead up to peace. This was quite
indispensable, as well to enable them to determine with themselves how far
victory might be followed up without danger, and how and where they would b=
e in
a condition to arrest the course of victory on the enemy=E2=80=99s side.
</p>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) Had Frederick the Great gained the Battle of Kollen, and taken prisoner=
s
the chief Austrian army with their two field marshals in Prague, it would h=
ave
been such a tremendous blow that he might then have entertained the idea of
marching to Vienna to make the Austrian Court tremble, and gain a peace
directly. This, in these times, unparalleled result, which would have been
quite like what we have seen in our day, only still more wonderful and
brilliant from the contest being between a little David and a great Goliath=
,
might very probably have taken place after the gain of this one battle; but
that does not contradict the assertion above maintained, for it only refers=
 to
what the king originally looked forward to from his offensive. The surround=
ing
and taking prisoners the enemy=E2=80=99s army was an event which was beyond=
 all
calculation, and which the king never thought of, at least not until the
Austrians laid themselves open to it by the unskilful position in which the=
y
placed themselves at Prague.
</p>

<p>
An attentive consideration of history shows wherein the difference of the t=
wo
cases consists. At the time of the Silesian War in the eighteenth century, =
war
was still a mere Cabinet affair, in which the people only took part as a bl=
ind
instrument; at the beginning of the nineteenth century the people on each s=
ide
weighed in the scale. The commanders opposed to Frederick the Great were me=
n
who acted on commission, and just on that account men in whom caution was a
predominant characteristic; the opponent of the Austrians and Prussians may=
 be
described in a few words as the very god of war himself.
</p>

<p>
Must not these different circumstances give rise to quite different
considerations? Should they not in the year 1805, 1806, and 1809 have point=
ed
to the extremity of disaster as a very close possibility, nay, even a very
great probability, and should they not at the same time have led to widely
different plans and measures from any merely aimed at the conquest of a cou=
ple
of fortresses or a paltry province?
</p>

<p>
They did not do so in a degree commensurate with their importance, although
both Austria and Prussia, judging by their armaments, felt that storms were
brewing in the political atmosphere. They could not do so because those
relations at that time were not yet so plainly developed as they have been
since from history. It is just those very campaigns of 1805, 1806, 1809, an=
d
following ones, which have made it easier for us to form a conception of mo=
dern
absolute war in its destroying energy.
</p>

<p>
Theory demands, therefore, that at the commencement of every war its charac=
ter
and main outline shall be defined according to what the political condition=
s
and relations lead us to anticipate as probable. The more, that according t=
o
this probability its character approaches the form of absolute war, the mor=
e
its outline embraces the mass of the belligerent states and draws them into=
 the
vortex, so much the more complete will be the relation of events to one ano=
ther
and the whole, but so much the more necessary it will also be not to take t=
he
first step without thinking what may be the last.

<h3><a name=3D"chap121"></a>B. On the Magnitude of the Object of the War, a=
nd the Efforts to be Made.</h3>

<p>
The compulsion which we must use towards our enemy will be regulated by the
proportions of our own and his political demands. In so far as these are
mutually known they will give the measure of the mutual efforts; but they a=
re
not always quite so evident, and this may be a first ground of a difference=
 in
the means adopted by each.
</p>

<p>
The situation and relations of the states are not like each other; this may
become a second cause.
</p>

<p>
The strength of will, the character and capabilities of the governments are=
 as
little like; this is a third cause.
</p>

<p>
These three elements cause an uncertainty in the calculation of the amount =
of
resistance to be expected, consequently an uncertainty as to the amount of
means to be applied and the object to be chosen.
</p>

<p>
As in war the want of sufficient exertion may result not only in failure bu=
t in
positive harm, therefore, the two sides respectively seek to outstrip each
other, which produces a reciprocal action.
</p>

<p>
This might lead to the utmost extremity of exertion, if it was possible to
define such a point. But then regard for the amount of the political demand=
s
would be lost, the means would lose all relation to the end, and in most ca=
ses
this aim at an extreme effort would be wrecked by the opposing weight of fo=
rces
within itself.
</p>

<p>
In this manner, he who undertakes war is brought back again into a middle
course, in which he acts to a certain extent upon the principle of only
applying so much force and aiming at such an object in war as are just
sufficient for the attainment of its political object. To make this princip=
le
practicable he must renounce every absolute necessity of a result, and thro=
w
out of the calculation remote contingencies.
</p>

<p>
Here, therefore, the action of the mind leaves the province of science,
strictly speaking, of logic and mathematics, and becomes, in the widest sen=
se
of the term, an art, that is, skill in discriminating, by the tact of judgm=
ent
among an infinite multitude of objects and relations, that which is the mos=
t
important and decisive. This tact of judgment consists unquestionably more =
or
less in some intuitive comparison of things and relations by which the remo=
te
and unimportant are more quickly set aside, and the more immediate and
important are sooner discovered than they could be by strictly logical
deduction.
</p>

<p>
In order to ascertain the real scale of the means which we must put forth f=
or
war, we must think over the political object both on our own side and on th=
e
enemy=E2=80=99s side; we must consider the power and position of the
enemy=E2=80=99s state as well as of our own, the character of his governmen=
t and
of his people, and the capacities of both, and all that again on our own si=
de,
and the political connections of other states, and the effect which the war
will produce on those States. That the determination of these diverse
circumstances and their diverse connections with each other is an immense
problem, that it is the true flash of genius which discovers here in a mome=
nt
what is right, and that it would be quite out of the question to become mas=
ter
of the complexity merely by a methodical study, this it is easy to conceive=
.
</p>

<p>
In this sense Buonaparte was quite right when he said that it would be a
problem in algebra before which a Newton might stand aghast.
</p>

<p>
If the diversity and magnitude of the circumstances and the uncertainty as =
to
the right measure augment in a high degree the difficulty of obtaining a ri=
ght
result, we must not overlook the fact that although the incomparable
<i>importance</i> of the matter does not increase the complexity and diffic=
ulty
of the problem, still it very much increases the merit of its solution. In =
men
of an ordinary stamp freedom and activity of mind are depressed not increas=
ed
by the sense of danger and responsibility: but where these things give wing=
s to
strengthen the judgment, there undoubtedly must be unusual greatness of sou=
l.
</p>

<p>
First of all, therefore, we must admit that the judgment on an approaching =
war,
on the end to which it should be directed, and on the means which are requi=
red,
can only be formed after a full consideration of the whole of the circumsta=
nces
in connection with it: with which therefore must also be combined the most
individual traits of the moment; next, that this decision, like all in mili=
tary
life, cannot be purely objective but must be determined by the mental and m=
oral
qualities of princes, statesmen, and generals, whether they are united in t=
he
person of one man or not.
</p>

<p>
The subject becomes general and more fit to be treated of in the abstract i=
f we
look at the general relations in which States have been placed by circumsta=
nces
at different times. We must allow ourselves here a passing glance at histor=
y.
</p>

<p>
Half-civilised Tartars, the Republics of ancient times, the feudal lords an=
d
commercial cities of the Middle Ages, kings of the eighteenth century, and,
lastly, princes and people of the nineteenth century, all carry on war in t=
heir
own way, carry it on differently, with different means, and for a different
object.
</p>

<p>
The Tartars seek new abodes. They march out as a nation with their wives an=
d
children, they are, therefore, greater than any other army in point of numb=
ers,
and their object is to make the enemy submit or expel him altogether. By th=
ese
means they would soon overthrow everything before them if a high degree of
civilisation could be made compatible with such a condition.
</p>

<p>
The old Republics with the exception of Rome were of small extent; still
smaller their armies, for they excluded the great mass of the populace: the=
y
were too numerous and lay too close together not to find an obstacle to gre=
at
enterprises in the natural equilibrium in which small separate parts always
place themselves according to the general law of nature: therefore their wa=
rs
were confined to devastating the open country and taking some towns in orde=
r to
ensure to themselves in these a certain degree of influence for the future.
</p>

<p>
Rome alone forms an exception, but not until the later period of its histor=
y.
For a long time, by means of small bands, it carried on the usual warfare w=
ith
its neighbours for booty and alliances. It became great more through the
alliances which it formed, and through which neighbouring peoples by degree=
s
became amalgamated with it into one whole, than through actual conquests. I=
t
was only after having spread itself in this manner all over Southern Italy,
that it began to advance as a really conquering power. Carthage fell, Spain=
 and
Gaul were conquered, Greece subdued, and its dominion extended to Egypt and
Asia. At this period its military power was immense, without its efforts be=
ing
in the same proportion. These forces were kept up by its riches; it no long=
er
resembled the ancient republics, nor itself as it had been; it stands alone=
.
</p>

<p>
Just as peculiar in their way are the wars of Alexander. With a small army,=
 but
distinguished for its intrinsic perfection, he overthrew the decayed fabric=
 of
the Asiatic States; without rest, and regardless of risks, he traverses the
breadth of Asia, and penetrates into India. No republics could do this. Onl=
y a
king, in a certain measure his own condottiere, could get through so much s=
o
quickly.
</p>

<p>
The great and small monarchies of the middle ages carried on their wars wit=
h
feudal armies. Everything was then restricted to a short period of time;
whatever could not be done in that time was held to be impracticable. The
feudal force itself was raised through an organisation of vassaldom; the bo=
nd
which held it together was partly legal obligation, partly a voluntary
contract; the whole formed a real confederation. The armament and tactics w=
ere
based on the right of might, on single combat, and therefore little suited =
to
large bodies. In fact, at no period has the union of States been so weak, a=
nd
the individual citizen so independent. All this influenced the character of=
 the
wars at that period in the most distinct manner. They were comparatively
rapidly carried out, there was little time spent idly in camps, but the obj=
ect
was generally only punishing, not subduing, the enemy. They carried off his
cattle, burnt his towns, and then returned home again.
</p>

<p>
The great commercial towns and small republics brought forward the condotti=
eri.
That was an expensive, and therefore, as far as visible strength, a very
limited military force; as for its intensive strength, it was of still less
value in that respect; so far from their showing anything like extreme ener=
gy
or impetuosity in the field, their combats were generally only sham fights.=
 In
a word, hatred and enmity no longer roused a state to personal activity, bu=
t
had become articles of trade; war lost great part of its danger, altered
completely its nature, and nothing we can say of the character it then assu=
med,
would be applicable to it in its reality.
</p>

<p>
The feudal system condensed itself by degrees into a decided territorial
supremacy; the ties binding the State together became closer; obligations w=
hich
concerned the person were made subject of composition; by degrees gold beca=
me
the substitute in most cases, and the feudal armies were turned into
mercenaries. The condottieri formed the connecting link in the change, and =
were
therefore, for a time, the instrument of the more powerful States; but this=
 had
not lasted long, when the soldier, hired for a limited term, was turned int=
o a
<i>standing mercenary</i>, and the military force of States now became an a=
rmy,
having its base in the public treasury.
</p>

<p>
It is only natural that the slow advance to this stage caused a diversified
interweaving of all three kinds of military force. Under Henry IV. we find =
the
feudal contingents, condottieri, and standing army all employed together. T=
he
condottieri carried on their existence up to the period of the Thirty
Years=E2=80=99 War, indeed there are slight traces of them even in the eigh=
teenth
century.
</p>

<p>
The other relations of the States of Europe at these different periods were
quite as peculiar as their military forces. Upon the whole, this part of th=
e
world had split up into a mass of petty States, partly republics in a state=
 of
internal dissension, partly small monarchies in which the power of the
government was very limited and insecure. A State in either of these cases
could not be considered as a real unity; it was rather an agglomeration of
loosely connected forces. Neither, therefore, could such a State be conside=
red
an intelligent being, acting in accordance with simple logical rules.
</p>

<p>
It is from this point of view we must look at the foreign politics and wars=
 of
the Middle Ages. Let us only think of the continual expeditions of the Empe=
rors
of Germany into Italy for five centuries, without any substantial conquest =
of
that country resulting from them, or even having been so much as in view. I=
t is
easy to look upon this as a fault repeated over and over again as a false v=
iew
which had its root in the nature of the times, but it is more in accordance
with reason to regard it as the consequence of a hundred important causes w=
hich
we can partially realise in idea, but the vital energy of which it is
impossible for us to understand so vividly as those who were brought into
actual conflict with them. As long as the great States which have risen out=
 of
this chaos required time to consolidate and organise themselves, their whol=
e
power and energy is chiefly directed to that point; their foreign wars are =
few,
and those that took place bear the stamp of a State-unity not yet well
cemented.
</p>

<p>
The wars between France and England are the first that appear, and yet at t=
hat
time France is not to be considered as really a monarchy, but as an
agglomeration of dukedoms and countships; England, although bearing more th=
e
semblance of a unity, still fought with the feudal organisation, and was
hampered by serious domestic troubles.
</p>

<p>
Under Louis XI., France made its greatest step towards internal unity; unde=
r
Charles VIII. it appears in Italy as a power bent on conquest; and under Lo=
uis
XIV. it had brought its political state and its standing army to the highes=
t
perfection.
</p>

<p>
Spain attains to unity under Ferdinand the Catholic; through accidental
marriage connections, under Charles V., suddenly arose the great Spanish
monarchy, composed of Spain, Burgundy, Germany, and Italy united. What this
colossus wanted in unity and internal political cohesion, it made up for by
gold, and its standing army came for the first time into collision with the
standing army of France. After Charles=E2=80=99s abdication, the great Span=
ish
colossus split into two parts, Spain and Austria. The latter, strengthened =
by
the acquisition of Bohemia and Hungary, now appears on the scene as a great
power, towing the German Confederation like a small vessel behind her.
</p>

<p>
The end of the seventeenth century, the time of Louis XIV., is to be regard=
ed
as the point in history at which the standing military power, such as it
existed in the eighteenth century, reached its zenith. That military force =
was
based on enlistment and money. States had organised themselves into complet=
e
unities; and the governments, by commuting the personal obligations of thei=
r
subjects into a money payment, had concentrated their whole power in their
treasuries. Through the rapid strides in social improvements, and a more
enlightened system of government, this power had become very great in
comparison to what it had been. France appeared in the field with a standin=
g
army of a couple of hundred thousand men, and the other powers in proportio=
n.
</p>

<p>
The other relations of States had likewise altered. Europe was divided into=
 a
dozen kingdoms and two republics; it was now conceivable that two of these
powers might fight with each other without ten times as many others being m=
ixed
up in the quarrel, as would certainly have been the case formerly. The poss=
ible
combinations in political relations were still manifold, but they could be
discerned and determined from time to time according to probability.
</p>

<p>
Internal relations had almost everywhere settle down into a pure monarchica=
l
form; the rights and influence of privileged bodies or estates had graduall=
y
died away, and the cabinet had become a complete unity, acting for the Stat=
e in
all its external relations. The time had therefore come that a suitable
instrument and a despotic will could give war a form in accordance with the
theoretical conception.
</p>

<p>
And at this epoch appeared three new Alexanders Gustavus Adolphus, Charles
XII., and Frederick the Great, whose aim was by small but highly-discipline=
d
armies, to raise little States to the rank of great monarchies, and to thro=
w
down everything that opposed them. If they had had only to deal with Asiati=
c
States, they would have more closely resembled Alexander in the parts they
acted. In any case, we may look upon them as the precursors of Buonaparte a=
s
respects that which may be risked in war.
</p>

<p>
But what war gained on the one side in force and consistency was lost again=
 on
the other side.
</p>

<p>
Armies were supported out of the treasury, which the sovereign regarded par=
tly
as his private purse, or at least as a resource belonging to the government=
,
and not to the people. Relations with other states, except with respect to =
a
few commercial subjects, mostly concerned only the interests of the treasur=
y or
of the government, not those of the people; at least ideas tended everywher=
e in
that way. The cabinets, therefore, looked upon themselves as the owners and
administrators of large estates, which they were continually seeking to
increase without the tenants on these estates being particularly interested=
 in
this improvement. The people, therefore, who in the Tartar invasions were
everything in war, who, in the old republics, and in the Middle Ages, (if w=
e
restrict the idea to those possessing the rights of citizens,) were of grea=
t
consequence, were in the eighteenth century, absolutely nothing directly,
having only still an indirect influence on the war through their virtues an=
d
faults.
</p>

<p>
In this manner, in proportion as the government separated itself from the
people, and regarded itself as the state, war became more exclusively a
business of the government, which it carried on by means of the money in it=
s
coffers and the idle vagabonds it could pick up in its own and neighbouring
countries. The consequence of this was, that the means which the government
could command had tolerably well defined limits, which could be mutually
estimated, both as to their extent and duration; this robbed war of its mos=
t
dangerous feature: namely the effort towards the extreme, and the hidden se=
ries
of possibilities connected therewith.
</p>

<p>
The financial means, the contents of the treasury, the state of credit of t=
he
enemy, were approximately known as well as the size of his army. Any large
increase of these at the outbreak of a war was impossible. Inasmuch as the
limits of the enemy=E2=80=99s power could thus be judged of, a State felt
tolerably secure from complete subjugation, and as the State was conscious =
at
the same time of the limits of its own means, it saw itself restricted to a
moderate aim. Protected from an extreme, there was no necessity to venture =
on
an extreme. Necessity no longer giving an impulse in that direction, that
impulse could only now be given by courage and ambition. But these found a
powerful counterpoise in the political relations. Even kings in command wer=
e
obliged to use the instrument of war with caution. If the army was disperse=
d,
no new one could be got, and except the army there was nothing. This impose=
d as
a necessity great prudence in all undertakings. It was only when a decided
advantage seemed to present itself that they made use of the costly instrum=
ent;
to bring about such an opportunity was a general=E2=80=99s art; but until i=
t was
brought about they floated to a certain degree in an absolute vacuum, there=
 was
no ground of action, and all forces, that is all designs, seemed to rest. T=
he
original motive of the aggressor faded away in prudence and circumspection.
</p>

<p>
Thus war, in reality, became a regular game, in which Time and Chance shuff=
led
the cards; but in its signification it was only diplomacy somewhat intensif=
ied,
a more vigorous way of negotiating, in which battles and sieges were
substituted for diplomatic notes. To obtain some moderate advantage in orde=
r to
make use of it in negotiations for peace, was the aim even of the most
ambitious.
</p>

<p>
This restricted, shrivelled-up form of war proceeded, as we have said, from=
 the
narrow basis on which it was supported. But that excellent generals and kin=
gs,
like Gustavus Adolphus, Charles XII., and Frederick the Great, at the head =
of
armies just as excellent, could not gain more prominence in the general mas=
s of
phenomena that even these men were obliged to be contented to remain at the
ordinary level of moderate results, is to be attributed to the balance of p=
ower
in Europe. Now that States had become greater, and their centres further ap=
art
from each other, what had formerly been done through direct perfectly natur=
al
interests, proximity, contact, family connections, personal friendship, to
prevent any one single State among the number from becoming suddenly great =
was
effected by a higher cultivation of the art of diplomacy. Political interes=
ts,
attractions and repulsions developed into a very refined system, so that a
cannon shot could not be fired in Europe without all the cabinets having so=
me
interest in the occurrence.
</p>

<p>
A new Alexander must therefore try the use of a good pen as well as his goo=
d
sword; and yet he never went very far with his conquests.
</p>

<p>
But although Louis XIV. had in view to overthrow the balance of power in
Europe, and at the end of the seventeenth century had already got to such a
point as to trouble himself little about the general feeling of animosity, =
he
carried on war just as it had heretofore been conducted; for while his army=
 was
certainly that of the greatest and richest monarch in Europe, in its nature=
 it
was just like others.
</p>

<p>
Plundering and devastating the enemy=E2=80=99s country, which play such an
important part with Tartars, with ancient nations, and even in the Middle A=
ges,
were no longer in accordance with the spirit of the age. They were justly
looked upon as unnecessary barbarity, which might easily be retaliated, and
which did more injury to the enemy=E2=80=99s subjects than the enemy=E2=80=
=99s
government, therefore, produced no effect beyond throwing the nation back m=
any
stages in all that relates to peaceful arts and civilisation. War, therefor=
e,
confined itself more and more both as regards means and end, to the army
itself. The army with its fortresses, and some prepared positions, constitu=
ted
a State in a State, within which the element of war slowly consumed itself.=
 All
Europe rejoiced at its taking this direction, and held it to be the necessa=
ry
consequence of the spirit of progress. Although there lay in this an error,
inasmuch as the progress of the human mind can never lead to what is absurd=
,
can never make five out of twice two, as we have already said, and must aga=
in
repeat, still upon the whole this change had a beneficial effect for the
people; only it is not to be denied that it had a tendency to make war stil=
l
more an affair of the State, and to separate it still more from the interes=
ts
of the people. The plan of a war on the part of the state assuming the
offensive in those times consisted generally in the conquest of one or othe=
r of
the enemy=E2=80=99s provinces; the plan of the defender was to prevent this=
; the
particular plan of campaign was to take one or other of the enemy=E2=80=99s
fortresses, or to prevent one of our own from being taken; it was only when=
 a
battle became unavoidable for this purpose that it was sought for and fough=
t.
Whoever fought a battle without this unavoidable necessity, from mere innat=
e
desire of gaining a victory, was reckoned a general with too much daring.
Generally the campaign passed over with one siege, or if it was a very acti=
ve
one, with two sieges, and winter quarters, which were regarded as a necessi=
ty,
and during which, the faulty arrangements of the one could never be taken
advantage of by the other, and in which the mutual relations of the two par=
ties
almost entirely ceased, formed a distinct limit to the activity which was
considered to belong to one campaign.
</p>

<p>
If the forces opposed were too much on an equality, or if the aggressor was
decidedly the weaker of the two, then neither battle nor siege took place, =
and
the whole of the operations of the campaign pivoted on the maintenance of
certain positions and magazines, and the regular exhaustion of particular
districts of country.
</p>

<p>
As long as war was universally conducted in this manner, and the natural li=
mits
of its force were so close and obvious, so far from anything absurd being
perceived in it, all was considered to be in the most regular order; and
criticism, which in the eighteenth century began to turn its attention to t=
he
field of art in war, addressed itself to details without troubling itself m=
uch
about the beginning and the end. Thus there was eminence and perfection of
every kind, and even Field Marshal Daun, to whom it was chiefly owing that
Frederick the Great completely attained his object, and that Maria Theresa
completely failed in hers, notwithstanding that could still pass for a grea=
t
General. Only now and again a more penetrating judgment made its appearance=
,
that is, sound common sense acknowledged that with superior numbers somethi=
ng
positive should be attained or war is badly conducted, whatever art may be
displayed.
</p>

<p>
Thus matters stood when the French Revolution broke out; Austria and Prussi=
a
tried their diplomatic art of war; this very soon proved insufficient. Whil=
st,
according to the usual way of seeing things, all hopes were placed on a ver=
y
limited military force in 1793, such a force as no one had any conception o=
f,
made its appearance. War had suddenly become again an affair of the people,=
 and
that of a people numbering thirty millions, every one of whom regarded hims=
elf
as a citizen of the State. Without entering here into the details of
circumstances with which this great phenomenon was attended, we shall confi=
ne
ourselves to the results which interest us at present. By this participatio=
n of
the people in the war instead of a cabinet and an army, a whole nation with=
 its
natural weight came into the scale. Henceforward, the means available the
efforts which might be called forth had no longer any definite limits; the
energy with which the war itself might be conducted had no longer any
counterpoise, and consequently the danger for the adversary had risen to th=
e
extreme.
</p>

<p>
If the whole war of the revolution passed over without all this making itse=
lf
felt in its full force and becoming quite evident; if the generals of the
revolution did not persistently press on to the final extreme, and did not
overthrow the monarchies in Europe; if the German armies now and again had =
the
opportunity of resisting with success, and checking for a time the torrent =
of
victory, the cause lay in reality in that technical incompleteness with whi=
ch
the French had to contend, which showed itself first amongst the common
soldiers, then in the generals, lastly, at the time of the Directory, in th=
e
Government itself.
</p>

<p>
After all this was perfected by the hand of Buonaparte, this military power=
,
based on the strength of the whole nation, marched over Europe, smashing
everything in pieces so surely and certainly, that where it only encountere=
d
the old fashioned armies the result was not doubtful for a moment. A re-act=
ion,
however, awoke in due time. In Spain, the war became of itself an affair of=
 the
people. In Austria, in the year 1809, the Government commenced extraordinar=
y
efforts, by means of Reserves and Landwehr, which were nearer to the true
object, and far surpassed in degree what this State had hitherto conceived
possible, In Russia, in 1812, the example of Spain and Austria was taken as=
 a
pattern, the enormous dimensions of that empire on the one hand allowed the
preparations, although too long deferred, still to produce effect; and, on =
the
other hand, intensified the effect produced. The result was brilliant. In
Germany, Prussia rose up the first, made the war a national cause, and with=
out
either money or credit, and with a population reduced one half, took the fi=
eld
with an army twice as strong as that of 1806. The rest of Germany followed =
the
example of Prussia sooner or later, and Austria, although less energetic th=
an
in 1809, still also came forward with more than its usual strength. Thus it=
 was
that Germany and Russia in the years 1813 and 1814, including all who took =
an
active part in, or were absorbed in these two campaigns, appeared against
France with about a million of men.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, the energy thrown into the conduct of the war wa=
s
quite different; and, although not quite on a level with that of the French=
,
although at some points timidity was still to be observed, the course of th=
e
campaigns, upon the whole, may be said to have been in the new, not in the =
old,
style. In eight months the theatre of war was removed from the Oder to the
Seine. Proud Paris had to bow its head for the first time; and the redoubta=
ble
Buonaparte lay fettered on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, since the time of Buonaparte, war, through being first on one si=
de,
then again on the other, an affair of the whole nation, has assumed quite a=
 new
nature, or rather it has approached much nearer to its real nature, to its
absolute perfection. The means then called forth had no visible limit, the
limit losing itself in the energy and enthusiasm of the Government and its
subjects. By the extent of the means, and the wide field of possible result=
s,
as well as by the powerful excitement of feeling which prevailed, energy in=
 the
conduct of war was immensely increased; the object of its action was the
downfall of the foe; and not until the enemy lay powerless on the ground wa=
s it
supposed to be possible to stop or to come to any understanding with respec=
t to
the mutual objects of the contest.
</p>

<p>
Thus, therefore, the element of war, freed from all conventional restrictio=
ns,
broke loose, with all its natural force. The cause was the participation of=
 the
people in this great <i>affair of State</i>, and this participation arose
partly from the effects of the French Revolution on the internal affairs of
countries, partly from the threatening attitude of the French towards all
nations.
</p>

<p>
Now, whether this will be the case always in future, whether all wars herea=
fter
in Europe will be carried on with the whole power of the States, and,
consequently, will only take place on account of great interests closely
affecting the people, or whether a separation of the interests of the
Government from those of the people will gradually again arise, would be a
difficult point to settle; and, least of all, shall we take upon us to sett=
le
it. But every one will agree with us, that bounds, which to a certain exten=
t
existed only in an unconsciousness of what is possible, when once thrown do=
wn,
are not easily built up again; and that, at least, whenever great interests=
 are
in dispute, mutual hostility will discharge itself in the same manner as it=
 has
done in our times.
</p>

<p>
We here bring our historical survey to a close, for it was not our design t=
o
give at a gallop some of the principles on which war has been carried on in
each age, but only to show how each period has had its own peculiar forms o=
f
war, its own restrictive conditions, and its own prejudices. Each period wo=
uld,
therefore, also keep its own theory of war, even if every where, in early
times, as well as in later, the task had been undertaken of working out a
theory on philosophical principles. The events in each age must, therefore,=
 be
judged of in connection with the peculiarities of the time, and only he who=
,
less through an anxious study of minute details than through an accurate gl=
ance
at the whole, can transfer himself into each particular age, is fit to
understand and appreciate its generals.
</p>

<p>
But this conduct of war, conditioned by the peculiar relations of States, a=
nd
of the military force employed, must still always contain in itself somethi=
ng
more general, or rather something quite general, with which, above everythi=
ng,
theory is concerned.
</p>

<p>
The latest period of past time, in which war reached its absolute strength,
contains most of what is of general application and necessary. But it is ju=
st
as improbable that wars henceforth will all have this grand character as th=
at
the wide barriers which have been opened to them will ever be completely cl=
osed
again. Therefore, by a theory which only dwells upon this absolute war, all
cases in which external influences alter the nature of war would be exclude=
d or
condemned as false. This cannot be the object of theory, which ought to be =
the
science of war, not under ideal but under real circumstances. Theory,
therefore, whilst casting a searching, discriminating and classifying glanc=
e at
objects, should always have in view the manifold diversity of causes from w=
hich
war may proceed, and should, therefore, so trace out its great features as =
to
leave room for what is required by the exigencies of time and the moment.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, we must add that the object which every one who undertakes war
proposes to himself, and the means which he calls forth, are determined
entirely according to the particular details of his position; and on that v=
ery
account they will also bear in themselves the character of the time and of =
the
general relations; lastly, <i>that they are always subject to the general
conclusions to be deduced from the nature of war</i>.

<h3><a name=3D"chap122"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>Ends in War More Precisely Defin=
ed<br>
Overthrow of the Enemy</h3>

<p>
The aim of war in conception must always be the overthrow of the enemy; thi=
s is
the fundamental idea from which we set out.
</p>

<p>
Now, what is this overthrow? It does not always imply as necessary the comp=
lete
conquest of the enemy=E2=80=99s country. If the Germans had reached Paris, =
in
1792, there=E2=80=94in all human probability=E2=80=94the war with the Revol=
utionary
party would have been brought to an end at once for a season; it was not at=
 all
necessary at that time to beat their armies beforehand, for those armies we=
re
not yet to be looked upon as potent powers in themselves singly. On the oth=
er
hand, in 1814, the allies would not have gained everything by taking Paris =
if
Buonaparte had still remained at the head of a considerable army; but as hi=
s
army had nearly melted away, therefore, also in the year 1814 and 1815 the
taking of Paris decided all. If Buonaparte in the year 1812, either before =
or
after taking Moscow, had been able to give the Russian army of 120,000 on t=
he
Kaluga road, a complete defeat, such as he gave the Austrians in 1805, and =
the
Prussian army, 1806, then the possession of that capital would most probabl=
y
have brought about a peace, although an enormous tract of country still
remained to be conquered. In the year 1805 it was the battle of Austerlitz =
that
was decisive; and, therefore, the previous possession of Vienna and two-thi=
rds
of the Austrian States, was not of sufficient weight to gain for Buonaparte=
 a
peace; but, on the other hand also, after that battle of Austerlitz, the
integrity of Hungary, still intact, was not of sufficient weight to prevent=
 the
conclusion of peace. In the Russian campaign, the complete defeat of the
Russian army was the last blow required: the Emperor Alexander had no other
army at hand, and, therefore, peace was the certain consequence of victory.=
 If
the Russian army had been on the Danube along with the Austrian, and had sh=
ared
in its defeat, then probably the conquest of Vienna would not have been
necessary, and peace would have been concluded in Linz.
</p>

<p>
In other cases, the complete conquest of a country has not been sufficient,=
 as
in the year 1807, in Prussia, when the blow levelled against the Russian
auxiliary army, in the doubtful battle of Eylau, was not decisive enough, a=
nd
the undoubted victory of Friedland was required as a finishing blow, like t=
he
victory of Austerlitz in the preceding year.
</p>

<p>
We see that here, also, the result cannot be determined from general ground=
s;
the individual causes, which no one knows who is not on the spot, and many =
of a
moral nature which are never heard of, even the smallest traits and acciden=
ts,
which only appear in history as anecdotes, are often decisive. All that the=
ory
can here say is as follows:=E2=80=94That the great point is to keep the
overruling relations of both parties in view. Out of them a certain centre =
of
gravity, a centre of power and movement, will form itself, on which everyth=
ing
depends; and against this centre of gravity of the enemy, the concentrated =
blow
of all the forces must be directed.
</p>

<p>
The little always depends on the great, the unimportant on the important, a=
nd
the accidental on the essential. This must guide our view.
</p>

<p>
Alexander had his centre of gravity in his army, so had Gustavus Adolphus,
Charles XII., and Frederick the Great, and the career of any one of them wo=
uld
soon have been brought to a close by the destruction of his army: in States
torn by internal dissensions, this centre generally lies in the capital; in
small states dependent on greater ones, it lies generally in the army of th=
ese
allies; in a confederacy, it lies in the unity of interests; in a national
insurrection, in the person of the chief leader, and in public opinion; aga=
inst
these points the blow must be directed. If the enemy by this loses his bala=
nce,
no time must be allowed for him to recover it; the blow must be persistentl=
y
repeated in the same direction, or, in other words, the conqueror must alwa=
ys
direct his blows upon the mass, but not against a fraction of the enemy. It=
 is
not by conquering one of the enemy=E2=80=99s provinces, with little trouble=
 and
superior numbers, and preferring the more secure possession of this unimpor=
tant
conquest to great results, but by seeking out constantly the heart of the
hostile power, and staking everything in order to gain all, that we can
effectually strike the enemy to the ground.
</p>

<p>
But whatever may be the central point of the enemy=E2=80=99s power against =
which
we are to direct our operations, still the conquest and destruction of his =
army
is the surest commencement, and in all cases, the most essential.
</p>

<p>
Hence we think that, according to the majority of ascertained facts, the
following circumstances chiefly bring about the overthrow of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
1. Dispersion of his army if it forms, in some degree, a potential force.
</p>

<p>
2. Capture of the enemy=E2=80=99s capital city, if it is both the centre of=
 the
power of the State and the seat of political assemblies and actions.
</p>

<p>
3. An effectual blow against the principal ally, if he is more powerful tha=
n
the enemy himself.
</p>

<p>
We have always hitherto supposed the enemy in war as a unity, which is
allowable for considerations of a very general nature. But having said that=
 the
subjugation of the enemy lies in the overcoming his resistance, concentrate=
d in
the centre of gravity, we must lay aside this supposition and introduce the
case, in which we have to deal with more than one opponent.
</p>

<p>
If two or more States combine against a third, that combination constitutes=
, in
a political aspect, only <i>one</i> war, at the same time this political un=
ion
has also its degrees.
</p>

<p>
The question is whether each State in the coalition possesses an independen=
t
interest in, and an independent force with which to prosecute, the war; or
whether there is one amongst them on whose interests and forces those of th=
e
others lean for support. The more that the last is the case, the easier it =
is
to look upon the different enemies as one alone, and the more readily we ca=
n
simplify our principal enterprise to one great blow; and as long as this is=
 in
any way possible, it is the most thorough and complete means of success.
</p>

<p>
We may, therefore, establish it as a principle, that if we can conquer all =
our
enemies by conquering one of them, the defeat of that one must be the aim o=
f
the war, because in that one we hit the common centre of gravity of the who=
le
war.
</p>

<p>
There are very few cases in which this kind of conception is not admissible=
,
and where this reduction of several centres of gravity to one cannot be mad=
e.
But if this cannot be done, then indeed there is no alternative but to look
upon the war as two or more separate wars, each of which has its own aim. A=
s
this case supposes the substantive independence of several enemies,
consequently a great superiority of the whole, therefore in this case the
overthrow of the enemy cannot, in general, come into question.
</p>

<p>
We now turn more particularly to the question, When is such an object possi=
ble
and advisable?
</p>

<p>
In the first place, our forces must be sufficient,=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. To gain a decisive victory over those of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
2. To make the expenditure of force which may be necessary to follow up the
victory to a point at which it will no longer be possible for the enemy to
regain his balance.
</p>

<p>
Next, we must feel sure that in our political situation, such a result will=
 not
excite against us new enemies, who may compel us on the spot to set free ou=
r
first enemy.
</p>

<p>
France, in the year 1806, was able completely to conquer Prussia, although =
in
doing so it brought down upon itself the whole military power of Russia,
because it was in a condition to cope with the Russians in Prussia.
</p>

<p>
France might have done the same in Spain in 1808 as far as regards England,=
 but
not as regards Austria. It was compelled to weaken itself materially in Spa=
in
in 1809, and must have quite given up the contest in that country if it had=
 not
had otherwise great superiority both physically and morally, over Austria.
</p>

<p>
These three cases should therefore be carefully studied, that we may not lo=
se
in the last the cause which we have gained in the former ones, and be conde=
mned
in costs.
</p>

<p>
In estimating the strength of forces, and that which may be effected by the=
m,
the idea very often suggests itself to look upon time by a dynamic analogy =
as a
factor of forces, and to assume accordingly that half efforts, or half the
number of forces would accomplish in two years what could only be effected =
in
one year by the whole force united. This view which lies at the bottom of
military schemes, sometimes clearly, sometimes less plainly, is completely
wrong.
</p>

<p>
An operation in war, like everything else upon earth, requires its time; as=
 a
matter of course we cannot walk from Wilna to Moscow in eight days; but the=
re
is no trace to be found in war of any reciprocal action between time and fo=
rce,
such as takes place in dynamics.
</p>

<p>
Time is necessary to both belligerents, and the only question is: which of =
the
two, judging by his position, has most reason to expect <i>special
advantages</i> from time? Now (exclusive of peculiarities in the situation =
on
one side or the other) the <i>vanquished</i> has plainly the most reason, a=
t
the same time certainly not by dynamic, but by psychological laws. Envy,
jealousy, anxiety for self, as well as now and again magnanimity, are the
natural intercessors for the unfortunate; they raise up for him on the one =
hand
friends, and on the other hand weaken and dissolve the coalition amongst hi=
s
enemies. Therefore, by delay something advantageous is more likely to happe=
n
for the conquered than for the conqueror. Further, we must recollect that t=
o
make right use of a first victory, as we have already shown, a great
expenditure of force is necessary; this is not a mere outlay once for all, =
but
has to be kept up like housekeeping, on a great scale; the forces which hav=
e
been sufficient to give us possession of a province, are not always suffici=
ent
to meet this additional outlay; by degrees the strain upon our resources
becomes greater, until at last it becomes insupportable; time, therefore, o=
f
itself may bring about a change.
</p>

<p>
Could the contributions which Buonaparte levied from the Russians and Poles=
, in
money and in other ways, in 1812, have procured the hundreds of thousands o=
f
men that he must have sent to Moscow in order to retain his position there?
</p>

<p>
But if the conquered provinces are sufficiently important, if there are in =
them
points which are essential to the well-being of those parts which are not
conquered, so that the evil, like a cancer, is perpetually of itself gnawin=
g
further into the system, then it is possible that the conqueror, although
nothing further is done, may gain more than he loses. Now in this state of
circumstances, if no help comes from without, then time may complete the wo=
rk
thus commenced; what still remains unconquered will, perhaps, fall of itsel=
f.
Therefore, thus time may also become a factor of his forces, but this can o=
nly
take place if a return blow from the conquered is no longer possible, a cha=
nge
of fortune in his favour no longer conceivable, when therefore this factor =
of
his forces is no longer of any value to the conqueror; for he has accomplis=
hed
the chief object, the danger of the culminating point is past, in short, th=
e
enemy is already subdued.
</p>

<p>
Our object in the above reasoning has been to show clearly that no conquest=
 can
be finished too soon, that spreading it over a <i>greater space of time</i>
than is absolutely necessary for its completion, instead of <i>facilitating=
</i>
it, makes it more <i>difficult</i>. If this assertion is true, it is furthe=
r
true also that if we are strong enough to effect a certain conquest, we mus=
t
also be strong enough to do it in one march without intermediate stations. =
Of
course we do not mean by this without short halts, in order to concentrate =
the
forces, and make other indispensable arrangements.
</p>

<p>
By this view, which makes the character of a speedy and persistent effort
towards a decision essential to offensive war, we think we have completely =
set
aside all grounds for <i>that</i> theory which in place of the irresistible
continued following up of victory, would substitute a slow methodical syste=
m as
being more sure and prudent. But even for those who have readily followed u=
s so
far, our assertion has, perhaps after all, so much the appearance of a para=
dox,
is at first sight so much opposed and offensive to an opinion which, like a=
n
old prejudice, has taken deep root, and has been repeated a thousand times =
in
books, that we considered it advisable to examine more closely the foundati=
on
of those plausible arguments which may be advanced.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly easier to reach an object near us than one at a distance, b=
ut
when the nearest one does not suit our purpose it does not follow that divi=
ding
the work, that a resting point, will enable us to get over the second half =
of
the road easier. A small jump is easier than a large one, but no one on tha=
t
account, wishing to cross a wide ditch, would jump half of it first.
</p>

<p>
If we look closely into the foundation of the conception of the so-called
methodical offensive war, we shall find it generally consists of the follow=
ing
things:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. Conquest of those fortresses belonging to the enemy which we meet with.
</p>

<p>
2. Laying in the necessary supplies.
</p>

<p>
3. Fortifying important points, as, <i>magazines, bridges, positions</i>, e=
tc.
</p>

<p>
4. Resting the troops in quarters during winter, or when they require to be
recruited in health and refreshed.
</p>

<p>
5. Waiting for the reinforcements of the ensuing year.
</p>

<p>
If for the attainment of all these objects we make a formal division in the
course of the offensive action, a resting point in the movement, it is supp=
osed
that we gain a new base and renewed force, as if our own State was followin=
g up
in the rear of the army, and that the latter laid in renewed vigour for eve=
ry
fresh campaign.
</p>

<p>
All these praiseworthy motives may make the offensive war more convenient, =
but
they do not make its results surer, and are generally only make-believes to
cover certain counteracting forces, such as the feelings of the commander o=
r
irresolution in the cabinet. We shall try to roll them up from the left fla=
nk.
</p>

<p>
1. The waiting for reinforcements suits the enemy just as well, and is, we =
may
say, more to his advantage. Besides, it lies in the nature of the thing tha=
t a
State can place in line nearly as many combatant forces in one year as in t=
wo;
for all the actual increase of combatant force in the second year is but
trifling in relation to the whole.
</p>

<p>
2. The enemy rests himself at the same time that we do.
</p>

<p>
3. The fortification of towns and positions is not the work of the army, an=
d
therefore no ground for any delay.
</p>

<p>
4. According to the present system of subsisting armies, magazines are more
necessary when the army is in cantonments, than when it is advancing. As lo=
ng
as we advance with success, we continually fall into possession of some of =
the
enemy=E2=80=99s provision depots, which assist us when the country itself i=
s
poor.
</p>

<p>
5. The taking of the enemy=E2=80=99s fortresses cannot be regarded as a
suspension of the attack: it is an intensified progress, and therefore the
seeming suspension which is caused thereby is not properly a case such as w=
e
allude to, it is neither a suspension nor a modifying of the use of force. =
But
whether a regular siege, a blockade, or a mere observation of one or other =
is
most to the purpose, is a question which can only be decided according to
particular circumstances. We can only say this in general, that in answerin=
g
this question another must be clearly decided, which is, whether the risk w=
ill
not be too great if, while only blockading, we at the same time make a furt=
her
advance. Where this is not the case, and when there is ample room to extend=
 our
forces, it is better to postpone the formal siege till the termination of t=
he
whole offensive movement. We must therefore take care not to be led into th=
e
error of neglecting the essential, through the idea of immediately making
secure that which is conquered.
</p>

<p>
No doubt it seems as if, by thus advancing, we at once hazard the loss of w=
hat
has been already gained. Our opinion, however, is that no division of actio=
n,
no resting point, no intermediate stations are in accordance with the natur=
e of
offensive war, and that when the same are unavoidable, they are to be regar=
ded
as an evil which makes the result not more certain, but, on the contrary, m=
ore
uncertain; and further, that, strictly speaking, if from weakness or any ca=
use
we have been obliged to stop, a second spring at the object we have in view=
 is,
as a rule, impossible; but if such a second spring is possible, then the
stoppage at the intermediate station was unnecessary, and that when an obje=
ct
at the very commencement is beyond our strength, it will always remain so.
</p>

<p>
We say, this appears to be the general truth, by which we only wish to set
aside the idea that time of itself can do something for the advantage of th=
e
assailant. But as the political relations may change from year to year,
therefore, on that account alone, many cases may happen which are exception=
s to
this general truth.
</p>

<p>
It may appear perhaps as if we had left our general point of view, and had
nothing in our eye except offensive war; but it is not so by any means.
Certainly, he who can set before himself the complete overthrow of the enem=
y as
his object, will not easily be reduced to take refuge in the defensive, the
immediate object of which is only to keep possession; but as we stand by th=
e
declaration throughout, that a defensive without any positive principle is =
a
contradiction in strategy as well as in tactics, and therefore always come =
back
to the fact that every defensive, according to its strength, will seek to
change to the attack as soon as it has exhausted the advantages of the
defensive, so therefore, however great or small the defence may be, we stil=
l
also include in it contingently the overthrow of the enemy as an object whi=
ch
this attack may have, and which is to be considered as the proper object of=
 the
defensive, and we say that there may be cases in which the assailant,
notwithstanding he has in view such a great object, may still prefer at fir=
st
to make use of the defensive form. That this idea is founded in reality is
easily shown by the campaign of 1812. The Emperor Alexander in engaging in =
the
war did not perhaps think of ruining his enemy completely, as was done in t=
he
sequel; but is there anything which makes such an idea impossible? And yet,=
 if
so, would it not still remain very natural that the Russians began the war =
on
the defensive?

<h3><a name=3D"chap123"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>Ends in War More Precisely Define=
d
(<i>continued</i>)<br>Limited Object</h3>

<p>
In the preceding chapter we have said that, under the expression
=E2=80=9Coverthrow of the enemy,=E2=80=9D we understand the real absolute a=
im of
the =E2=80=9Cact of war;=E2=80=9D now we shall see what remains to be done =
when the
conditions under which this object might be attained do not exist.
</p>

<p>
These conditions presuppose a great physical or moral superiority, or a gre=
at
spirit of enterprise, an innate propensity to extreme hazards. Now where al=
l
this is not forthcoming, the aim in the act of war can only be of two kinds=
;
either the conquest of some small or moderate portion of the enemy=E2=80=99=
s
country, or the defence of our own until better times; this last is the usu=
al
case in defensive war.
</p>

<p>
Whether the one or the other of these aims is of the right kind, can always=
 be
settled by calling to mind the expression used in reference to the last. <i=
>The
waiting till more favourable times</i> implies that we have reason to expec=
t
such times hereafter, and this waiting for, that is, defensive war, is alwa=
ys
based on this prospect; on the other hand, offensive war, that is, the taki=
ng
advantage of the present moment, is always commanded when the future holds =
out
a better prospect, not to ourselves, but to our adversary.
</p>

<p>
The third case, which is probably the most common, is when neither party ha=
s
anything definite to look for from the future, when therefore it furnishes =
no
motive for decision. In this case, the offensive war is plainly imperative =
upon
him who is politically the aggressor, that is, who has the positive motive;=
 for
he has taken up arms with that object, and every moment of time which is lo=
st
without any good reason, is so much lost time <i>for him</i>.
</p>

<p>
We have here decided for offensive or defensive war on grounds which have
nothing to do with the relative forces of the combatants respectively, and =
yet
it may appear that it would be nearer right to make the choice of the offen=
sive
or defensive chiefly dependent on the mutual relations of combatants in poi=
nt
of military strength; our opinion is, that in doing so we should just leave=
 the
right road. The logical correctness of our simple argument no one will disp=
ute;
we shall now see whether in the concrete case it leads to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
Let us suppose a small State which is involved in a contest with a very
superior power, and foresees that with each year its position will become
worse: should it not, if war is inevitable, make use of the time when its
situation is furthest from the worst? Then it must attack, not because the
attack in <i>itself</i> ensures any advantages=E2=80=94it will rather incre=
ase
the disparity of forces=E2=80=94but because this State is under the necessi=
ty of
either bringing the matter completely to an issue before the worst time
arrives, or of gaining, at least, in the mean time, some advantages which i=
t
may hereafter turn to account. This theory cannot appear absurd. But if thi=
s
small State is quite certain that the enemy will advance against it, then,
certainly, it can and may make use of the defensive against its enemy to
procure a first advantage; there is then at any rate no danger of losing ti=
me.
</p>

<p>
If, again, we suppose a small State engaged in war with a greater, and that=
 the
future has no influence on their decisions, still, if the small State is
politically the assailant, we demand of it also that it should go forward t=
o
its object.
</p>

<p>
If it has had the audacity to propose to itself a positive end in the face =
of
superior numbers, then it must also act, that is, attack the foe, if the la=
tter
does not save it the trouble. Waiting would be an absurdity; unless at the
moment of execution it has altered its political resolution, a case which v=
ery
frequently occurs, and contributes in no small degree to give wars an
indefinite character.
</p>

<p>
These considerations on the limited object apply to its connection both wit=
h
offensive war and defensive war; we shall consider both in separate chapter=
s.
But we shall first turn our attention to another phase.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto we have deduced the modifications in the object of war solely from
intrinsic reasons. The nature of the political view (or design) we have onl=
y
taken into consideration in so far as it is or is not directed at something
positive. Everything else in the political design is in reality something
extraneous to war; but in the second chapter of the first book (End and Mea=
ns
in War) we have already admitted that the nature of the political object, t=
he
extent of our own or the enemy=E2=80=99s demand, and our whole political re=
lation
practically have a most decisive influence on the conduct of the war, and w=
e
shall therefore devote the following chapter to that subject specially.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap124"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>A. Influence of the Political Ob=
ject on the Military Object</h3>

<p>
We never find that a State joining in the cause of another State, takes it =
up
with the same earnestness as its own. An auxiliary army of moderate strengt=
h is
sent; if it is not successful, then the ally looks upon the affair as in a
manner ended, and tries to get out of it on the cheapest terms possible.
</p>

<p>
In European politics it has been usual for States to pledge themselves to
mutual assistance by an alliance offensive and defensive, not so far that t=
he
one takes part in the interests and quarrels of the other, but only so far =
as
to promise one another beforehand the assistance of a fixed, generally very
moderate, contingent of troops, without regard to the object of the war, or=
 the
scale on which it is about to be carried on by the principals. In a treaty =
of
alliance of this kind, the ally does not look upon himself as engaged with =
the
enemy in a war properly speaking, which should necessarily begin with a
declaration of war, and end with a treaty of peace. Still, this idea also i=
s
nowhere fixed with any distinctness, and usage varies one way and another.
</p>

<p>
The thing would have a kind of consistency, and it would be less embarrassi=
ng
to the theory of war if this promised contingent of ten, twenty, or thirty
thousand men was handed over entirely to the state engaged in war, so that =
it
could be used as required; it might then be regarded as a subsidised force.=
 But
the usual practice is widely different. Generally the auxiliary force has i=
ts
own commander, who depends only on his own government, and to whom they
prescribe an object such as best suits the shilly-shally measures they have=
 in
view.
</p>

<p>
But even if two States go to war with a third, they do not always both look=
 in
like measure upon this common enemy as one that they must destroy or be
destroyed by themselves, the business is often settled like a commercial
transaction; each, according to the amount of the risk he incurs or the
advantage to be expected, takes shares in the concern to the extent of 30,0=
00
or 40,000 men, and acts as if he could not lose more than the amount of his
investment.
</p>

<p>
Not only is this the point of view taken when a State comes to the assistan=
ce
of another in a cause in which it has in a manner, little concern, but even
when both allies have a common and very considerable interest at stake, not=
hing
can be done except under diplomatic reservation, and the contracting partie=
s
usually only agree to furnish a small stipulated contingent, in order to em=
ploy
the rest of the forces according to the special ends to which policy may ha=
ppen
to lead them.
</p>

<p>
This way of regarding wars entered into by reason of alliances was quite
general, and was only obliged to give place to the natural way in quite mod=
ern
times, when the extremity of danger drove men=E2=80=99s minds into the natu=
ral
direction (as in the wars <i>against</i> Buonaparte), and when the most
boundless power compelled them to it (as <i>under</i> Buonaparte). It was a=
n
abnormal thing, an anomaly, for war and peace are ideas which in their
foundation can have no gradations; nevertheless it was no mere diplomatic
offspring which the reason could look down upon, but deeply rooted in the
natural limitedness and weakness of human nature.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, even in wars carried on without allies, the political cause of a wa=
r
has a great influence on the method in which it is conducted.
</p>

<p>
If we only require from the enemy a small sacrifice, then we content oursel=
ves
with aiming at a small equivalent by the war, and we expect to attain that =
by
moderate efforts. The enemy reasons in very much the same way. Now, if one =
or
the other finds that he has erred in his reckoning that in place of being
slightly superior to the enemy, as he supposed, he is, if anything, rather
weaker, still, at that moment, money and all other means, as well as suffic=
ient
moral impulse for greater exertions are very often deficient: in such a cas=
e he
just does what is called =E2=80=9Cthe best he can;=E2=80=9D hopes better th=
ings in
the future, although he has not the slightest foundation for such hope, and=
 the
war, in the mean time drags itself feebly along, like a body worn out with
sickness.
</p>

<p>
Thus it comes to pass that the reciprocal action, the rivalry, the violence=
 and
impetuosity of war lose themselves in the stagnation of weak motives, and t=
hat
both parties move with a certain kind of security in very circumscribed
spheres.
</p>

<p>
If this influence of the political object is once permitted, as it then mus=
t
be, there is no longer any limit, and we must be pleased to come down to su=
ch
warfare as consists in a <i>mere threatening of the enemy</i> and in
<i>negotiating</i>.
</p>

<p>
That the theory of war, if it is to be and to continue a philosophical stud=
y,
finds itself here in a difficulty is clear. All that is essentially inheren=
t in
the conception of war seems to fly from it, and it is in danger of being le=
ft
without any point of support. But the natural outlet soon shows itself.
According as a modifying principle gains influence over the act of war, or
rather, the weaker the motives to action become, the more the action will g=
lide
into a passive resistance, the less eventful it will become, and the less i=
t
will require guiding principles. All military art then changes itself into =
mere
prudence, the principal object of which will be to prevent the trembling
balance from suddenly turning to our disadvantage, and the half war from
changing into a complete one.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap125"></a>B. War as an Instrument of Policy</h3>

<p>
Having made the requisite examination on both sides of that state of antago=
nism
in which the nature of war stands with relation to other interests of men
individually and of the bond of society, in order not to neglect any of the
opposing elements, an antagonism which is founded in our own nature, and wh=
ich,
therefore, no philosophy can unravel, we shall now look for that unity into
which, in practical life, these antagonistic elements combine themselves by
partly neutralising each other. We should have brought forward this unity a=
t
the very commencement, if it had not been necessary to bring out this
contradiction very plainly, and also to look at the different elements
separately. Now, this unity is <i>the conception that war is only a part of
political intercourse, therefore by no means an independent thing in
itself</i>.
</p>

<p>
We know, certainly, that war is only called forth through the political
intercourse of Governments and nations; but in general it is supposed that =
such
intercourse is broken off by war, and that a totally different state of thi=
ngs
ensues, subject to no laws but its own.
</p>

<p>
We maintain, on the contrary: that war is nothing but a continuation of
political intercourse, with a mixture of other means. We say, mixed with ot=
her
means, in order thereby to maintain at the same time that this political
intercourse does not cease by the war itself, is not changed into something
quite different, but that, in its essence, it continues to exist, whatever =
may
be the form of the means which it uses, and that the chief lines on which t=
he
events of the war progress, and to which they are attached, are only the
general features of policy which run all through the war until peace takes
place. And how can we conceive it to be otherwise? Does the cessation of
diplomatic notes stop the political relations between different nations and
Governments? Is not war merely another kind of writing and language for
political thoughts? It has certainly a grammar of its own, but its logic is=
 not
peculiar to itself.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, war can never be separated from political intercourse, and if,=
 in
the consideration of the matter, this is done in any way, all the threads o=
f
the different relations are, to a certain extent, broken, and we have befor=
e us
a senseless thing without an object.
</p>

<p>
This kind of idea would be indispensable even if war was perfect war, the
perfectly unbridled element of hostility, for all the circumstances on whic=
h it
rests, and which determine its leading features, viz., our own power, the
enemy=E2=80=99s power, allies on both sides, the characteristics of the peo=
ple
and their Governments respectively, etc., as enumerated in the first chapte=
r of
the first book, are they not of a political nature, and are they not so
intimately connected with the whole political intercourse that it is imposs=
ible
to separate them? But this view is doubly indispensable if we reflect that =
real
war is no such consistent effort tending to an extreme, as it should be
according to the abstract idea, but a half and half thing, a contradiction =
in
itself; that, as such, it cannot follow its own laws, but must be looked up=
on
as a part of another whole, and this whole is policy.
</p>

<p>
Policy in making use of war avoids all those rigorous conclusions which pro=
ceed
from its nature; it troubles itself little about final possibilities, confi=
ning
its attention to immediate probabilities. If much uncertainty in the whole
action ensues therefrom, if it thereby becomes a sort of game, the policy o=
f
each cabinet places its confidence in the belief that in this game it will
surpass its neighbour in skill and sharpsightedness.
</p>

<p>
Thus policy makes out of the all-overpowering element of war a mere instrum=
ent,
changes the tremendous battle-sword, which should be lifted with both hands=
 and
the whole power of the body to strike once for all, into a light handy weap=
on,
which is even sometimes nothing more than a rapier to exchange thrusts and
feints and parries.
</p>

<p>
Thus the contradictions in which man, naturally timid, becomes involved by =
war,
may be solved, if we choose to accept this as a solution.
</p>

<p>
If war belongs to policy, it will naturally take its character from thence.=
 If
policy is grand and powerful, so will also be the war, and this may be carr=
ied
to the point at which war attains to <i>its absolute form</i>.
</p>

<p>
In this way of viewing the subject, therefore, we need not shut out of sigh=
t
the absolute form of war, we rather keep it continually in view in the back
ground.
</p>

<p>
Only through this kind of view, war recovers unity; only by it can we see a=
ll
wars as things of one kind; and it is only through it that the judgment can
obtain the true and perfect basis and point of view from which great plans =
may
be traced out and determined upon.
</p>

<p>
It is true the political element does not sink deep into the details of war=
,
Vedettes are not planted, patrols do not make their rounds from political
considerations, but small as is its influence in this respect, it is great =
in
the formation of a plan for a whole war, or a campaign, and often even for =
a
battle.
</p>

<p>
For this reason we were in no hurry to establish this view at the commencem=
ent.
While engaged with particulars, it would have given us little help; and, on=
 the
other hand, would have distracted our attention to a certain extent; in the
plan of a war or campaign it is indispensable.
</p>

<p>
There is, upon the whole, nothing more important in life than to find out t=
he
right point of view from which things should be looked at and judged of, an=
d
then to keep to that point; for we can only apprehend the mass of events in
their unity from one standpoint; and it is only the keeping to one point of
view that guards us from inconsistency.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, in drawing up a plan of a war it is not allowable to have a
two-fold or three-fold point of view, from which things may be looked at, n=
ow
with the eye of a soldier, then with that of an administrator, and then aga=
in
with that of a politician, etc., then the next question is, whether
<i>policy</i> is necessarily paramount, and everything else subordinate to =
it.
</p>

<p>
That policy unites in itself, and reconciles all the interests of internal
administrations, even those of humanity, and whatever else are rational
subjects of consideration, is presupposed, for it is nothing in itself, exc=
ept
a mere representative and exponent of all these interests towards other Sta=
tes.
That policy may take a false direction, and may promote unfairly the ambiti=
ous
ends, the private interests, the vanity of rulers, does not concern us here=
;
for, under no circumstances can the art of war be regarded as its preceptor=
,
and we can only look at policy here as the representative of the interests
generally of the whole community.
</p>

<p>
The only question, therefore, is, whether in framing plans for a war the
political point of view should give way to the purely military (if such a p=
oint
is conceivable), that is to say, should disappear altogether, or subordinat=
e
itself to it, or whether the political is to remain the ruling point of vie=
w,
and the military to be considered subordinate to it.
</p>

<p>
That the political point of view should end completely when war begins, is =
only
conceivable in contests which are wars of life and death, from pure hatred:=
 as
wars are in reality, they are as we before said, only the expressions or
manifestations of policy itself. The subordination of the political point o=
f
view to the military would be contrary to common sense, for policy has decl=
ared
the war; it is the intelligent faculty, war only the instrument, and not th=
e
reverse. The subordination of the military point of view to the political i=
s,
therefore, the only thing which is possible.
</p>

<p>
If we reflect on the nature of real war, and call to mind what has been sai=
d in
the third chapter of this book, <i>that every war should be viewed above al=
l
things according to the probability of its character, and its leading featu=
res
as they are to be deduced from the political forces and proportions</i>, an=
d
that often=E2=80=94indeed we may safely affirm, in our days, <i>almost</i>
always=E2=80=94war is to be regarded as an organic whole, from which the si=
ngle
branches are not to be separated, in which therefore every individual activ=
ity
flows into the whole, and also has its origin in the idea of this whole, th=
en
it becomes certain and palpable to us that the superior stand-point for the
conduct of the war, from which its leading lines must proceed, can be no ot=
her
than that of policy.
</p>

<p>
From this point of view the plans come, as it were, out of a cast; the
apprehension of them and the judgment upon them become easier and more natu=
ral,
our convictions respecting them gain in force, motives are more satisfying,=
 and
history more intelligible.
</p>

<p>
At all events, from this point of view, there is no longer in the nature of
things a necessary conflict between the political and military interests, a=
nd
where it appears it is therefore to be regarded as imperfect knowledge only=
.
That policy makes demands on the war which it cannot respond to, would be
contrary to the supposition that it knows the instrument which it is going =
to
use, therefore, contrary to a natural and indispensable supposition. But if=
 it
judges correctly of the march of military events, it is entirely its affair=
,
and can be its only to determine what are the events and what the direction=
 of
events most favourable to the ultimate and great end of the war.
</p>

<p>
In one word, the art of war in its highest point of view is policy, but, no
doubt, a policy which fights battles, instead of writing notes.
</p>

<p>
According to this view, to leave a great military enterprise, or the plan f=
or
one, to a <i>purely military judgment and decision</i>, is a distinction wh=
ich
cannot be allowed, and is even prejudicial; indeed, it is an irrational
proceeding to consult professional soldiers on the plan of a war, that they=
 may
give a <i>purely military opinion</i> upon what the cabinet should do; but
still more absurd is the demand of Theorists that a statement of the availa=
ble
means of war should be laid before the general, that he may draw out a pure=
ly
military plan for the war or for a campaign, in accordance with those means=
.
Experience in general also teaches us that notwithstanding the multifarious
branches and scientific character of military art in the present day, still=
 the
leading outlines of a war are always determined by the cabinet, that is, if=
 we
would use technical language, by a political not a military functionary.
</p>

<p>
This is perfectly natural. None of the principal plans which are required f=
or a
war can be made without an insight into the political relations; and, in
reality, when people speak, as they often do, of the prejudicial influence =
of
policy on the conduct of a war, they say in reality something very differen=
t to
what they intend. It is not this influence but the policy itself which shou=
ld
be found fault with. If policy is right, that is, if it succeeds in hitting=
 the
object, then it can only act on the war in its sense, with advantage also; =
and
if this influence of policy causes a divergence from the object, the cause =
is
only to be looked for in a mistaken policy.
</p>

<p>
It is only when policy promises itself a wrong effect from certain military
means and measures, an effect opposed to their nature, that it can exercise=
 a
prejudicial effect on war by the course it prescribes. Just as a person in =
a
language with which he is not conversant sometimes says what he does not
intend, so policy, when intending right, may often order things which do no=
t
tally with its own views.
</p>

<p>
This has happened times without end, and it shows that a certain knowledge =
of
the nature of war is essential to the management of political commerce.
</p>

<p>
But before going further, we must guard ourselves against a false
interpretation of which this is very susceptible. We are far from holding t=
he
opinion that a war minister, smothered in official papers, a scientific
engineer, or even a soldier who has been well tried in the field, would, an=
y of
them, necessarily make the best minister of State where the sovereign does =
not
act for himself; or in other words, we do not mean to say that this
acquaintance with the nature of war is the principal qualification for a wa=
r
minister; elevation, superiority of mind, strength of character, these are =
the
principal qualifications which he must possess; a knowledge of war may be
supplied in one way or the other. France was never worse advised in its
military and political affairs than by the two Brothers Belleisle and the D=
uke
of Choiseul, although all three were good soldiers.
</p>

<p>
If war is to harmonise entirely with the political views and policy, to
accommodate itself to the means available for war, there is only one
alternative to be recommended when the statesman and soldier are not combin=
ed
in one person, which is, to make the chief commander a member of the cabine=
t,
that he may take part in its councils and decisions on important occasions.=
 But
then again, this is only possible when the cabinet, that is the government
itself, is near the theatre of war, so that things can be settled without a
serious waste of time.
</p>

<p>
This is what the Emperor of Austria did in 1809, and the allied sovereigns =
in
1813, 1814, 1815, and the arrangement proved completely satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
The influence of any military man except the General-in Chief in the cabine=
t,
is extremely dangerous; it very seldom leads to able vigorous action. The
example of France in 1793, 1794, 1795, when Carnot, while residing in Paris=
,
managed the conduct of the war, is to be avoided, as a system of terror is =
not
at the command of any but a revolutionary government.
</p>

<p>
We shall now conclude with some reflections derived from history.
</p>

<p>
In the last decennary of the past century, when that remarkable change in t=
he
art of war in Europe took place by which the best armies found that a part =
of
their method of war had become utterly unserviceable, and events were broug=
ht
about of a magnitude far beyond what any one had any previous conception of=
, it
certainly appeared that a false calculation of everything was to be laid to=
 the
charge of the art of war. It was plain that while confined by habit within =
a
narrow circle of conceptions, she had been surprised by the force of a new
state of relations, lying, no doubt, outside that circle, but still not out=
side
the nature of things.
</p>

<p>
Those observers who took the most comprehensive view, ascribed the circumst=
ance
to the general influence which policy had exercised for centuries on the ar=
t of
war, and undoubtedly to its very great disadvantage, and by which it had su=
nk
into a half-measure, often into mere sham fighting. They were right as to f=
act,
but they were wrong in attributing it to something accidental, or which mig=
ht
have been avoided.
</p>

<p>
Others thought that everything was to be explained by the momentary influen=
ce
of the particular policy of Austria, Prussia, England, etc., with regard to
their own interests respectively.
</p>

<p>
But is it true that the real surprise by which men=E2=80=99s minds were sei=
zed,
was confined to the conduct of war, and did not rather relate to policy its=
elf?
That is, as we should say: did the ill success proceed from the influence o=
f
policy on the war, or from a wrong policy itself?
</p>

<p>
The prodigious effects of the French revolution abroad were evidently broug=
ht
about much less through new methods and views introduced by the French in t=
he
conduct of war than through the changes which it wrought in state-craft and
civil administration, in the character of governments, in the condition of =
the
people, etc. That other governments took a mistaken view of all these thing=
s;
that they endeavoured, with their ordinary means, to hold their own against
forces of a novel kind, and overwhelming in strength; all that was a blunde=
r in
policy.
</p>

<p>
Would it have been possible to perceive and mend this error by a scheme for=
 the
war from a purely military point of view? Impossible. For if there had been=
,
even in reality, a philosophical strategist, who merely from the nature of =
the
hostile elements, had foreseen all the consequences, and prophesied remote
possibilities, still it would have been purely impossible to have turned su=
ch
wisdom to account.
</p>

<p>
If policy had risen to a just appreciation of the forces which had sprung u=
p in
France, and of the new relations in the political state of Europe, it might
have foreseen the consequences, which must follow in respect to the great
features of war, and it was only in this way that it could arrive at a corr=
ect
view of the extent of the means required as well as of the best use to make=
 of
those means.
</p>

<p>
We may therefore say, that the twenty years=E2=80=99 victories of the revol=
ution
are chiefly to be ascribed to the erroneous policy of the governments by wh=
ich
it was opposed.
</p>

<p>
It is true these errors first displayed themselves in the war, and the even=
ts
of the war completely disappointed the expectations which policy entertaine=
d.
But this did not take place because policy neglected to consult its militar=
y
advisers. That art of war in which the politician of the day could believe,
namely, that derived from the reality of war at that time, that which belon=
ged
to the policy of the day, that familiar instrument which policy had hithert=
o
used=E2=80=94<i>that</i> art of war, I say, was naturally involved in the e=
rror
of policy, and therefore could not teach it anything better. It is true tha=
t
war itself underwent important alterations both in its nature and forms, wh=
ich
brought it nearer to its absolute form; but these changes were not brought
about because the French Government had, to a certain extent, delivered its=
elf
from the leading-strings of policy; they arose from an altered policy, prod=
uced
by the French Revolution, not only in France, but over the rest of Europe a=
s
well. This policy had called forth other means and other powers, by which i=
t
became possible to conduct war with a degree of energy which could not have
been thought of otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the actual changes in the art of war are a consequence of
alterations in policy; and, so far from being an argument for the possible
separation of the two, they are, on the contrary, very strong evidence of t=
he
intimacy of their connexion.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, once more: war is an instrument of policy; it must necessarily b=
ear
its character, it must measure with its scale: the conduct of war, in its g=
reat
features, is therefore policy itself, which takes up the sword in place of =
the
pen, but does not on that account cease to think according to its own laws.

<h3><a name=3D"chap126"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>Limited Object=E2=80=94Offensiv=
e War</h3>

<p>
Even if the complete overthrow of the enemy cannot be the object, there may
still be one which is directly positive, and this positive object can be
nothing else than the conquest of a part of the enemy=E2=80=99s country.
</p>

<p>
The use of such a conquest is this, that we weaken the enemy=E2=80=99s reso=
urces
generally, therefore, of course, his military power, while we increase our =
own;
that we therefore carry on the war, to a certain extent, at his expense;
further in this way, that in negotiations for peace, the possession of the
enemy=E2=80=99s provinces may be regarded as net gain, because we can eithe=
r keep
them or exchange them for other advantages.
</p>

<p>
This view of a conquest of the enemy=E2=80=99s provinces is very natural, a=
nd
would be open to no objection if it were not that the defensive attitude, w=
hich
must succeed the offensive, may often cause uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
In the chapter on the culminating point of victory we have sufficiently
explained the manner in which such an offensive weakens the combatant force=
,
and that it may be succeeded by a situation causing anxiety as to the futur=
e.
</p>

<p>
This weakening of our combatant force by the conquest of part of the
enemy=E2=80=99s territory has its degrees, and these depend chiefly on the
geographical position of this portion of territory. The more it is an annex=
 of
our own country, being contiguous to or embraced by it, the more it is in t=
he
direction of our principal force, by so much the less will it weaken our
combatant force. In the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, Saxony was a natural comp=
lement
of the Prussian theatre of war, and Frederick the Great=E2=80=99s army, ins=
tead
of being weakened, was strengthened by the possession of that province, bec=
ause
it lies nearer to Silesia than to the Mark, and at the same time covers the
latter.
</p>

<p>
Even in 1740 and 1741, after Frederick the Great had once conquered Silesia=
, it
did not weaken his army in the field, because, owing to its form and situat=
ion
as well as the contour of its frontier line, it only presented a narrow poi=
nt
to the Austrians, as long as they were not masters of Saxony, and besides t=
hat,
this small point of contact also lay in the direction of the chief operatio=
ns
of the contending forces.
</p>

<p>
If, on the other hand, the conquered territory is a strip running up betwee=
n
hostile provinces, has an eccentric position and unfavourable configuration=
 of
ground, then the weakening increases so visibly that a victorious battle
becomes not only much easier for the enemy, but it may even become unnecess=
ary
as well.
</p>

<p>
The Austrians have always been obliged to evacuate Provence without a battl=
e
when they have made attempts on it from Italy. In the year 1744 the French =
were
very well pleased even to get out of Bohemia without having lost a battle. =
In
1758 Frederick the Great could not hold his position in Bohemia and Moravia
with the same force with which he had obtained such brilliant successes in
Silesia and Saxony in 1757. Examples of armies not being able to keep
possession of conquered territory solely because their combatant force was =
so
much weakened thereby, are so common that it does not appear necessary to q=
uote
any more of them.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the question whether we should aim at such an object depends on
whether we can expect to hold possession of the conquest or whether a tempo=
rary
occupation (invasion, diversion) would repay the expenditure of force requi=
red:
especially, whether we have not to apprehend such a vigorous counterstroke =
as
will completely destroy the balance of forces. In the chapter on the
culmination point we have treated of the consideration due to this question=
 in
each particular case.
</p>

<p>
There is just one point which we have still to add.
</p>

<p>
An offensive of this kind will not always compensate us for what we lose up=
on
other points. Whilst we are engaged in making a partial conquest, the enemy=
 may
be doing the same at other points, and if our enterprise does not greatly
preponderate in importance then it will not compel the enemy to give up his=
. It
is, therefore, a question for serious consideration whether we may not lose
more than we gain in a case of this description.
</p>

<p>
Even if we suppose two provinces (one on each side) to be of equal value, w=
e
shall always lose more by the one which the enemy takes from us than we can
gain by the one we take, because a number of our forces become to a certain
extent like <i>faux frais</i>, non-effective. But as the same takes place o=
n
the enemy=E2=80=99s side also, one would suppose that in reality there is n=
o
ground to attach more importance to the maintenance of what is our own than=
 to
the conquest. But yet there is. The maintenance of our own territory is alw=
ays
a matter which more deeply concerns us, and the suffering inflicted on our =
own
state can not be outweighed, nor, to a certain extent, neutralised by what =
we
gain in return, unless the latter promises a high percentage, that is, is m=
uch
greater.
</p>

<p>
The consequence of all this is that a strategic attack directed against onl=
y a
moderate object involves a greater necessity for steps to defend other poin=
ts
which it does not directly cover than one which is directed against the cen=
tre
of the enemy=E2=80=99s force; consequently, in such an attack the concentra=
tion
of forces in time and space cannot be carried out to the same extent. In or=
der
that it may take place, at least as regards time, it becomes necessary for =
the
advance to be made offensively from every point possible, and at the same
moment exactly: and therefore this attack loses the other advantage of bein=
g
able to make shift with a much smaller force by acting on the defensive at
particular points. In this way the effect of aiming at a minor object is to
bring all things more to a level: the whole act of the war cannot now be
concentrated into one principal affair which can be governed according to
leading points of view; it is more dispersed; the friction becomes greater
everywhere, and there is everywhere more room for chance.
</p>

<p>
This is the natural tendency of the thing. The commanders weighed down by i=
t,
finds himself more and more neutralised. The more he is conscious of his ow=
n
powers, the greater his resources subjectively, and his power objectively, =
so
much the more he will seek to liberate himself from this tendency in order =
to
give to some one point a preponderating importance, even if that should onl=
y be
possible by running greater risks.

<div class=3D"chapter">

<h3><a name=3D"chap127"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>Limited Object=E2=80=94Defence=
</h3>

<p>
The ultimate aim of defensive war can never be an absolute negation, as we =
have
before observed. Even for the weakest there must be some point in which the
enemy may be made to feel, and which may be threatened.
</p>

<p>
Certainly we may say that this object is the exhaustion of the adversary, f=
or
as he has a positive object, every one of his blows which fails, if it has =
no
other result than the loss of the force applied, still may be considered a
retrograde step <i>in reality</i>, whilst the loss which the defensive suff=
ers
is not in vain, because his object was keeping possession, and that he has
effected. This would be tantamount to saying that the defensive has his
positive object in merely keeping possession. Such reasoning might be good =
if
it was certain that the assailant after a certain number of fruitless attem=
pts
must be worn out, and desist from further efforts. But just this necessary
consequence is wanting. If we look at the exhaustion of forces, the defende=
r is
under a disadvantage. The assailant becomes weaker, but only in the sense t=
hat
it may reach a turning point; if we set aside that supposition, the weakeni=
ng
goes on certainly more rapidly on the defensive side than on that of the
assailant: for in the first place, he is the weaker, and, therefore, if the
losses on both sides are equal, he loses more actually than the other; in t=
he
next place, he is deprived generally of a portion of territory and of his
resources. We have, therefore, here no ground on which to build the expecta=
tion
that the offensive will cease, and nothing remains but the idea that if the
assailant repeats his blows, while the defensive does nothing but wait to w=
ard
them off, then the defender has no counterpoise as a set off to the risk he
runs of one of these attacks succeeding sooner or later.
</p>

<p>
Although in reality the exhaustion, or rather the weakening of the stronger=
,
has brought about a peace in many instances that is to be attributed to the
indecision which is so general in war, but cannot be imagined philosophical=
ly
as the general and ultimate object of any defensive war whatever, there is,
therefore, no alternative but that the defence should find its object in th=
e
idea of the =E2=80=9C<i>waiting for</i>,=E2=80=9D which is besides its real
character. This idea in itself includes that of an alteration of circumstan=
ces,
of an improvement of the situation, which, therefore, when it cannot be bro=
ught
about by internal means, that is, by defensive pure in itself, can only be
expected through assistance coming from without. Now, this improvement from
without can proceed from nothing else than a change in political relations;
either new alliances spring up in favour of the defender, or old ones direc=
ted
against him fall to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, is the object for the defender, in case his weakness does not
permit him to think of any important counterstroke. But this is not the nat=
ure
of every defensive war, according to the conception which we have given of =
its
form. According to that conception it is the stronger form of war, and on
account of that strength it can also be applied when a counterstroke more o=
r
less important is designed.
</p>

<p>
These two cases must be kept distinct from the very first, as they have an
influence on the defence.
</p>

<p>
In the first case, the defender=E2=80=99s object is to keep possession of h=
is own
country intact as long as possible, because in that way he gains most time;=
 and
gaining time is the only way to attain his object. The positive object whic=
h he
can in most cases attain, and which will give him an opportunity of carryin=
g
out his object in the negotiations for peace, he cannot yet include in his =
plan
for the war. In this state of strategic passiveness, the advantages which t=
he
defender can gain at certain points consist in merely repelling partial
attacks; the preponderance gained at those points he tries to make of servi=
ce
to him at others, for he is generally hard pressed at all points. If he has=
 not
the opportunity of doing this, then there often only accrues to him the sma=
ll
advantage that the enemy will leave him at rest for a time.
</p>

<p>
If the defender is not altogether too weak, small offensive operations dire=
cted
less towards permanent possession than a temporary advantage to cover losse=
s,
which may be sustained afterwards, invasions, diversions, or enterprises
against a single fortress, may have a place in this defensive system withou=
t
altering its object or essence.
</p>

<p>
But in the second case, in which a positive object is already grafted upon =
the
defensive, the greater the counterstroke that is warranted by circumstances=
 the
more the defensive imports into itself of positive character. In other word=
s,
the more the defence has been adopted voluntarily, in order to make the fir=
st
blow surer, the bolder may be the snares which the defender lays for his
opponent. The boldest, and if it succeeds, the most effectual, is the retre=
at
into the interior of the country; and this means is then at the same time t=
hat
which differs most widely from the other system.
</p>

<p>
Let us only think of the difference between the position in which Frederick=
 the
Great was placed in the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, and that of Russia in 181=
2.
</p>

<p>
When the war began, Frederick, through his advanced state of preparation fo=
r
war, had a kind of superiority, this gave him the advantage of being able t=
o
make himself master of Saxony, which was besides such a natural complement =
of
his theatre of war, that the possession of it did not diminish, but increas=
ed,
his combatant force.
</p>

<p>
At the opening of the campaign of 1757, the King endeavoured to proceed wit=
h
his strategic attack, which seemed not impossible as long as the Russians a=
nd
French had not yet reached the theatre of war in Silesia, the Mark and Saxo=
ny.
But the attack miscarried, and Frederick was thrown back on the defensive f=
or
the rest of the campaign, was obliged to evacuate Bohemia and to rescue his=
 own
theatre from the enemy, in which he only succeeded by turning himself with =
one
and the same army, first upon the French, and then upon the Austrians. This
advantage he owed entirely to the defensive.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1758 when his enemies had drawn round him in a closer circle, a=
nd
his forces were dwindling down to a very disproportionate relation, he
determined on an offensive on a small scale in Moravia: his plan was to tak=
e
Olm=C3=BCtz before his enemies were prepared; not in the expectation of kee=
ping
possession of, or of making it a base for further advance, but to use it as=
 a
sort of advanced work, a <i>counter-approach</i> against the Austrians, who
would be obliged to devote the rest of the present campaign, and perhaps ev=
en a
second, to recover possession of it. This attack also miscarried. Frederick
then gave up all idea of a real offensive, as he saw that it only increased=
 the
disproportion of his army. A compact position in the heart of his own count=
ry
in Saxony and Silesia, the use of short lines, that he might be able rapidl=
y to
increase his forces at any point which might be menaced, a battle when
unavoidable, small incursions when opportunity offered, and along with this=
 a
patient state of waiting-for (expectation), a saving of his means for bette=
r
times became now his general plan. By degrees the execution of it became mo=
re
and more passive. As he saw that even a victory cost him too much, therefor=
e he
tried to manage at still less expense; everything depended on gaining time,=
 and
on keeping what he had got; he therefore became more tenacious of yielding =
any
ground, and did not hesitate to adopt a perfect cordon system. The position=
s of
Prince Henry in Saxony, as well as those of the King in the Silesian mounta=
ins,
may be so termed. In his letters to the Marquis d=E2=80=99Argens, he manife=
sts
the impatience with which he looks forward to winter quarters, and the
satisfaction he felt at being able to take them up again without having
suffered any serious loss.
</p>

<p>
Whoever blames Frederick for this, and looks upon it as a sign that his spi=
rit
had sunk, would, we think, pass judgment without much reflection.
</p>

<p>
If the entrenched camp at Bunzelwitz, the positions taken up by Prince Henr=
y in
Saxony, and by the King in the Silesian mountains, do not appear to us now =
as
measures on which a General should place his dependence in a last extremity
because a Buonaparte would soon have thrust his sword through such tactical
cobwebs, we must not forget that times have changed, that war has become a
totally different thing, is quickened with new energies, and that therefore
positions might have been excellent at that time, although they are not so =
now,
and that in addition to all, the character of the enemy deserves attention.
Against the army of the German States, against Daun and Butturlin, it might
have been the height of wisdom to employ means which Frederick would have
despised if used against himself.
</p>

<p>
The result justified this view: in the state of patient expectation, Freder=
ick
attained his object, and got round difficulties in a collision with which h=
is
forces would have been dashed to pieces.
</p>

<p>
The relation in point of numbers between the Russian and French armies oppo=
sed
to each other at the opening of the campaign in 1812 was still more
unfavourable to the former than that between Frederick and his enemies in t=
he
Seven Years=E2=80=99 War. But the Russians looked forward to being joined b=
y
large reinforcements in the course of the campaign. All Europe was in secre=
t
hostility to Buonaparte, his power had been screwed up to the highest point=
, a
devouring war occupied him in Spain, and the vast extent of Russia allowed =
of
pushing the exhaustion of the enemy=E2=80=99s military means to the utmost
extremity by a retreat over a hundred miles of country. Under circumstances=
 on
this grand scale, a tremendous counterstroke was not only to be expected if=
 the
French enterprise failed (and how could it succeed if the Russian Emperor w=
ould
not make peace, or his subjects did not rise in insurrection?) but this
counterstroke might also end in the complete destruction of the enemy. The =
most
profound sagacity could, therefore, not have devised a better plan of campa=
ign
than that which the Russians followed on the spur of the moment.
</p>

<p>
That this was not the opinion at the time, and that such a view would then =
have
been looked upon as preposterous, is no reason for our now denying it to be=
 the
right one. If we are to learn from history, we must look upon things which =
have
actually happened as also possible in the future, and that the series of gr=
eat
events which succeeded the march upon Moscow is not a succession of mere
accidents every one will grant who can claim to give an opinion on such
subjects. If it had been possible for the Russians, with great efforts, to
defend their frontier, it is certainly probable that in such case also the
French power would have sunk, and that they would have at last suffered a
reverse of fortune; but the reaction then would certainly not have been so
violent and decisive. By sufferings and sacrifices (which certainly in any
other country would have been greater, and in most would have been impossib=
le)
Russia purchased this enormous success.
</p>

<p>
Thus a great positive success can never be obtained except through positive
measures, planned not with a view to a mere state of =E2=80=9Cwaiting-for,=
=E2=80=9D
but with a view to a <i>decision</i>, in short, even on the defensive, ther=
e is
no great gain to be won except by a great stake.

<h3><a name=3D"chap128"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>Plan of War when the Destruction=
 of the Enemy is the Object</h3>

<p>
Having characterised in detail the different aims to which war may be direc=
ted,
we shall go through the organisation of war as a whole for each of the thre=
e
separate gradations corresponding to these aims.
</p>

<p>
In conformity with all that has been said on the subject up to the present,=
 two
fundamental principles reign throughout the whole plan of the war, and serv=
e as
a guide for everything else.
</p>

<p>
The first is: to reduce the weight of the enemy=E2=80=99s power into as few
centres of gravity as possible, into one if it can be done; again, to confi=
ne
the attack against these centres of force to as few principal undertakings =
as
possible, to one if possible; lastly, to keep all secondary undertakings as
subordinate as possible. In a word, the first principle is, <i>to act
concentrated as much as possible</i>.
</p>

<p>
The second principle runs thus <i>to act as swiftly as possible;</i> theref=
ore,
to allow of no delay or detour without sufficient reason.
</p>

<p>
The reducing the enemy=E2=80=99s power to one central point depends
</p>

<p>
1. On the nature of its political connection. If it consists of armies of o=
ne
Power, there is generally no difficulty; if of allied armies, of which one =
is
acting simply as an ally without any interest of its own, then the difficul=
ty
is not much greater; if of a coalition for a common object, then it depends=
 on
the cordiality of the alliance; we have already treated of this subject.
</p>

<p>
2. On the situation of the theatre of war upon which the different hostile
armies make their appearance.
</p>

<p>
If the enemy=E2=80=99s forces are collected in one army upon one theatre of=
 war,
they constitute in reality a unity, and we need not inquire further; if the=
y
are upon one theatre of war, but in separate armies, which belong to differ=
ent
Powers, there is no longer absolute unity; there is, however, a sufficient
interdependence of parts for a decisive blow upon one part to throw down th=
e
other in the concussion. If the armies are posted in theatres of war adjoin=
ing
each other, and not separated by any great natural obstacles, then there is=
 in
such case also a decided influence of the one upon the other; but if the
theatres of war are wide apart, if there is neutral territory, great mounta=
ins,
etc., intervening between them, then the influence is very doubtful and
improbable as well; if they are on quite opposite sides of the State agains=
t
which the war is made, so that operations directed against them must diverg=
e on
eccentric lines, then almost every trace of connection is at an end.
</p>

<p>
If Prussia was attacked by France and Russia at the same time, it would be =
as
respects the conduct of the war much the same as if there were two separate
wars; at the same time the unity would appear in the negotiations.
</p>

<p>
Saxony and Austria, on the contrary, as military powers in the Seven
Years=E2=80=99 War, were to be regarded as one; what the one suffered the o=
ther
felt also, partly because the theatres of war lay in the same direction for
Frederick the Great, partly because Saxony had no political independence.
</p>

<p>
Numerous as were the enemies of Buonaparte in Germany in 1813, still they a=
ll
stood very much in one direction in respect to him, and the theatres of war=
 for
their armies were in close connection, and reciprocally influenced each oth=
er
very powerfully. If by a concentration of all his forces he had been able t=
o
overpower the main army, such a defeat would have had a decisive effect on =
all
the parts. If he had beaten the Bohemain grand army, and marched upon Vienn=
a by
Prague, Bl=C3=BCcher, however willing, could not have remained in Saxony, b=
ecause he
would have been called upon to co-operate in Bohemia, and the Crown Prince =
of
Sweden as well would have been unwilling to remain in the Mark.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Austria, if carrying on war against the French on the Rh=
ine
and Italy at the same time, will always find it difficult to give a decisio=
n
upon one of those theatres by means of a successful stroke on the other. Pa=
rtly
because Switzerland, with its mountains, forms too strong a barrier between=
 the
two theatres, and partly because the direction of the roads on each side is
divergent. France, again, can much sooner decide in the one by a successful
result in the other, because the direction of its forces in both converges =
upon
Vienna, the centre of the power of the whole Austrian empire; we may add
further, that a decisive blow in Italy will have more effect on the Rhine
theatre than a success on the Rhine would have in Italy, because the blow f=
rom
Italy strikes nearer to the centre, and that from the Rhine more upon the
flank, of the Austrian dominions.
</p>

<p>
It proceeds from what we have said that the conception of separated or
connected hostile power extends through all degrees of relationship, and th=
at
therefore, in each case, the first thing is to discover the influence which
events in one theatre may have upon the other, according to which we may th=
en
afterwards settle how far the different forces of the enemy may be reduced =
into
one centre of force.
</p>

<p>
There is only one exception to the principle of directing all our strength
against the centre of gravity of the enemy=E2=80=99s power, that is, if anc=
illary
expeditions promise <i>extraordinary advantages</i>, and still, in this cas=
e,
it is a condition assumed, that we have such a decisive superiority as enab=
les
us to undertake such enterprises without incurring too great risk at the po=
int
which forms our great object.
</p>

<p>
When General Bulow marched into Holland in 1814, it was to be foreseen that=
 the
thirty thousand men composing his corps would not only neutralise the same
number of Frenchmen, but would, besides, give the English and the Dutch an
opportunity of entering the field with forces which otherwise would never h=
ave
been brought into activity.
</p>

<p>
Thus, therefore, the first consideration in the combination of a plan for a
war, is to determine the centres of gravity of the enemy=E2=80=99s power, a=
nd, if
possible, to reduce them to one. The second is to unite the forces which ar=
e to
be employed against the centre of force into one great action.
</p>

<p>
Here now the following grounds for dividing our forces may present themselv=
es:
</p>

<p>
1. The original position of the military forces, therefore also the situati=
on
of the States engaged in the offensive.
</p>

<p>
If the concentration of the forces would occasion detours and loss of time,=
 and
the danger of advancing by separate lines is not too great, then the same m=
ay
be justifiable on those grounds; for to effect an unnecessary concentration=
 of
forces, with great loss of time, by which the freshness and rapidity of the
first blow is diminished, would be contrary to the second leading principle=
 we
have laid down. In all cases in which there is a hope of surprising the ene=
my
in some measure, this deserves particular attention.
</p>

<p>
But the case becomes still more important if the attack is undertaken by al=
lied
States which are not situated on a line directed towards the State attacked=
 not
one behind the other but situated side by side. If Prussia and Austria
undertook a war against France, it would be a very erroneous measure, a
squandering of time and force if the armies of the two powers were obliged =
to
set out from the same point, as the natural line for an army operating from
Prussia against the heart of France is from the Lower Rhine, and that of th=
e
Austrians is from the Upper Rhine. Concentration, therefore, in this case,
could only be effected by a sacrifice; consequently in any particular insta=
nce,
the question to be decided would be, Is the necessity for concentration so
great that this sacrifice must be made?
</p>

<p>
2. The attack by separate lines may offer greater results.
</p>

<p>
As we are now speaking of advancing by separate lines against one centre of
force, we are, therefore, supposing an advance by <i>converging lines</i>. =
A
separate advance on parallel or eccentric lines belongs to the rubric of
<i>accessory undertakings</i>, of which we have already spoken.
</p>

<p>
Now, every convergent attack in strategy, as well as in tactics, holds out =
the
prospect of great results; for if it succeeds, the consequence is not simpl=
y a
defeat, but more or less the cutting off of the enemy. The concentric attac=
k
is, therefore, always that which may lead to the greatest results; but on
account of the separation of the parts of the force, and the enlargement of=
 the
theatre of war, it involves also the most risk; it is the same here as with
attack and defence, the weaker form holds out the greater results in prospe=
ct.
</p>

<p>
The question, therefore, is, whether the assailant feels strong enough to t=
ry
for this great result.
</p>

<p>
When Frederick the Great advanced upon Bohemia, in the year 1757, he set ou=
t
from Saxony and Silesia with his forces divided. The two principal reasons =
for
his doing so were, first, that his forces were so cantoned in the winter th=
at a
concentration of them at one point would have divested the attack of all th=
e
advantages of a surprise; and next, that by this concentric advance, each o=
f
the two Austrian theatres of war was threatened in the flanks and the rear.=
 The
danger to which Frederick the Great exposed himself on that occasion was th=
at
one of his two armies might have been completely defeated by superior force=
s;
should the Austrians <i>not see this</i>, then they would have to give batt=
le
with their centre only, or run the risk of being thrown off their line of
communication, either on one side or the other, and meeting with a catastro=
phe;
this was the great result which the king hoped for by this advance. The
Austrians preferred the battle in the centre, but Prague, where they took u=
p
their position, was in a situation too much under the influence of the
convergent attack, which, as they remained perfectly passive in their posit=
ion,
had time to develop its efficacy to the utmost. The consequence of this was
that when they lost the battle, it was a complete catastrophe; as is manife=
st
from the fact that two-thirds of the army with the commander-in-chief were
obliged to shut themselves up in Prague.
</p>

<p>
This brilliant success at the opening of the campaign was attained by the b=
old
stroke with a concentric attack. If Frederick considered the precision of h=
is
own movements, the energy of his generals, the moral superiority of his tro=
ops,
on the one side, and the sluggishness of the Austrians on the other, as
sufficient to ensure the success of his plan, who can blame him? But as we
cannot leave these moral advantages out of consideration, neither can we
ascribe the success solely to the mere geometrical form of the attack. Let =
us
only think of the not less brilliant campaign of Buonaparte=E2=80=99s, in t=
he
year 1796, when the Austrians were so severely punished for their concentri=
c
march into Italy. The means which the French general had at command on that
occasion, the Austrian general had also at his disposal in 1757 (with the
exception of the moral), indeed, he had rather more, for he was not, like
Buonaparte, weaker than his adversary. Therefore, when it is to be apprehen=
ded
that the advance on separate converging lines may afford the enemy the mean=
s of
counteracting the inequality of numerical forces by using interior lines, s=
uch
a form of attack is not advisable; and if on account of the situation of th=
e
belligerents, it must be resorted to, it can only be regarded as a necessar=
y
evil.
</p>

<p>
If, from this point of view, we cast our eyes on the plan which was adopted=
 for
the invasion of France in 1814, it is impossible to give it approval. The
Russian, Austrian, and Prussian armies were concentrated at a point near
Frankfort on the Maine, on the most natural and most direct line to the cen=
tre
of the force of the French monarchy. These armies were then separated, that=
 one
might penetrate into France from Mayence, the other from Switzerland. As th=
e
enemy=E2=80=99s force was so reduced that a defence of the frontier was out=
 of
the question, the whole advantage to be expected from this concentric advan=
ce,
if it succeeded, was that while Lorraine and Alsace were conquered by one a=
rmy,
Franche-Comte would be taken by the other. Was this trifling advantage wort=
h
the trouble of marching into Switzerland? We know very well that there were
other (but just as insufficient) grounds which caused this march; but we
confine ourselves here to the point which we are considering.
</p>

<p>
On the other side, Buonaparte was a man who thoroughly understood the defen=
sive
to oppose to a concentric attack, as he had already shown in his masterly
campaign of 1796; and although the Allies were very considerably superior i=
n
numbers, yet the preponderance due to his superiority as a general was on a=
ll
occasions acknowledged. He joined his army too late near Chalons, and looke=
d
down rather too much, generally, on his opponents, still he was very near
hitting the two armies separately; and what was the state he found them in =
at
Brienne? Bl=C3=BCcher had only 27,000 of his 65,000 men with him, and the g=
reat
army, out of 200,000, had only 100,000 present. It was impossible to make a
better game for the adversary. And from the moment that active work began, =
no
greater want was felt than that of re-union.
</p>

<p>
After all these reflections, we think that although the concentric attack i=
s in
itself a means of obtaining greater results, still it should generally only
proceed from a previous separation of the parts composing the whole force, =
and
that there are few cases in which we should do right in giving up the short=
est
and most direct line of operation for the sake of adopting that form.
</p>

<p>
3. The breadth of a theatre of war can be a motive for attacking on separat=
e
lines.
</p>

<p>
If an army on the offensive in its advance from any point, penetrates with
success to some distance into the interior of the enemy=E2=80=99s country, =
then,
certainly, the space which it commands is not restricted exactly to the lin=
e of
road by which it marches, it will command a margin on each side; still that
will depend very much, if we may use the figure, on the solidity and cohesi=
on
of the opposing State. If the State only hangs loosely together, if its peo=
ple
are an effeminate race unaccustomed to war, then, without our taking much
trouble, a considerable extent of country will open behind our victorious a=
rmy;
but if we have to deal with a brave and loyal population, the space behind =
our
army will form a triangle, more or less acute.
</p>

<p>
In order to obviate this evil, the attacking force requires to regulate its
advance on a certain width of front. If the enemy=E2=80=99s force is concen=
trated
at a particular point, this breadth of front can only be preserved so long =
as
we are not in contact with the enemy, and must be contracted as we approach=
 his
position: that is easy to understand.
</p>

<p>
But if the enemy himself has taken up a position with a certain extent of
front, then there is nothing absurd in a corresponding extension on our par=
t.
We speak here of one theatre of war, or of several, if they are quite close=
 to
each other. Obviously this is, therefore, the case when, according to our v=
iew,
the chief operation is, at the same time, to be decisive on subordinate poi=
nts
</p>

<p>
But now can we <i>always</i> run the chance of this? And may we expose
ourselves to the danger which must arise if the influence of the chief
operation is not sufficient to decide at the minor points? Does not the wan=
t of
a certain breadth for a theatre of war deserve special consideration?
</p>

<p>
Here as well as everywhere else it is impossible to exhaust the number of
combinations which <i>may take</i> place; but we maintain that, with few
exceptions, the decision on the capital point will carry with it the decisi=
on
on all minor points. Therefore, the action should be regulated in conformit=
y
with this principle, in all cases in which the contrary is not evident.
</p>

<p>
When Buonaparte invaded Russia, he had good reason to believe that by
conquering the main body of the Russian army he would compel their forces o=
n
the Upper Dwina to succumb. He left at first only the corps of Oudinot to
oppose them, but Wittgenstein assumed the offensive, and Buonaparte was the=
n
obliged to send also the sixth corps to that quarter.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, at the beginning of the campaign, he directed a part of =
his
forces against Bagration; but that general was carried along by the influen=
ce
of the backward movement in the centre, and Buonaparte was enabled then to
recall that part of his forces. If Wittgenstein had not had to cover the se=
cond
capital, he would also have followed the retreat of the great army under
Barclay.
</p>

<p>
In the years 1805 and 1809, Buonaparte=E2=80=99s victories at Ulm and Ratis=
bon
decided matters in Italy and also in the Tyrol, although the first was rath=
er a
distant theatre, and an independent one in itself. In the year 1806, his
victories at Jena and Auerstadt were decisive in respect to everything that
might have been attempted against him in Westphalia and Hesse, or on the
Frankfort road.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the number of circumstances which may have an influence on the
resistance at secondary points, there are two which are the most prominent.
</p>

<p>
The first is: that in a country of vast extent, and also relatively of grea=
t
power, like Russia, we can put off the decisive blow at the chief point for
some time, and are not obliged to do all in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
The second is: when a minor point (like Silesia in the year 1806), through =
a
great number of fortresses, possesses an extraordinary degree of independen=
t
strength. And yet Buonaparte treated that point with great contempt, inasmu=
ch
as, when he had to leave such a point completely in his rear on the march t=
o
Warsaw, he only detached 20,000 men under his brother Jerome to that quarte=
r.
</p>

<p>
If it happens that the blow at the capital point, in all probability, will =
not
shake such a secondary point, or has not done so, and if the enemy has stil=
l
forces at that point, then to these, as a necessary evil, an adequate force
must be opposed, because no one can absolutely lay open his line of
communication from the very commencement.
</p>

<p>
But prudence may go a step further; it may require that the advance upon th=
e
chief point shall keep pace with that on the secondary points, and conseque=
ntly
the principal undertaking must be delayed whenever the secondary points wil=
l
not succumb.
</p>

<p>
This principle does not directly contradict ours as to uniting all action a=
s
far as possible in one great undertaking, but the spirit from which it spri=
ngs
is diametrically opposed to the spirit in which ours is conceived. By follo=
wing
such a principle there would be such a measured pace in the movements, such=
 a
paralysation of the impulsive force, such room for the freak of chance, and
such a loss of time, as would be practically perfectly inconsistent with an
offensive directed to the complete overthrow of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty becomes still greater if the forces stationed at these minor
points can retire on divergent lines. What would then become of the unity o=
f
our attack?
</p>

<p>
We must, therefore, declare ourselves completely opposed in principle to th=
e
dependence of the chief attack on minor attacks, and we maintain that an at=
tack
directed to the destruction of the enemy which has not the boldness to shoo=
t,
like the point of an arrow, direct at the heart of the enemy=E2=80=99s powe=
r, can
never hit the mark.
</p>

<p>
4. Lastly, there is still a fourth ground for a separate advance in the
facility which it may afford for subsistence.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly much pleasanter to march with a small army through an opule=
nt
country, than with a large army through a poor one; but by suitable measure=
s,
and with an army accustomed to privations, the latter is not impossible, an=
d,
therefore, the first should never have such an influence on our plans as to
lead us into a great danger.
</p>

<p>
We have now done justice to the grounds for a separation of forces which
divides the chief operation into several, and if the separation takes place=
 on
any of these grounds, with a distinct conception of the object, and after d=
ue
consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, we shall not venture to =
find
fault.
</p>

<p>
But if, as usually happens, a plan is drawn out by a learned general staff,
merely according to routine; if different theatres of war, like the squares=
 on
a chess board, must each have its piece first placed on it before the moves
begin, if these moves approach the aim in complicated lines and relations b=
y
dint of an imaginary profundity in the art of combination, if the armies ar=
e to
separate to-day in order to apply all their skill in reuniting at the great=
est
risk in fourteen days then we have a perfect horror of this abandonment of =
the
direct simple common-sense road to rush intentionally into absolute confusi=
on.
This folly happens more easily the less the general-in-chief directs the wa=
r,
and conducts it in the sense which we have pointed out in the first chapter=
 as
an act of his individuality invested with extraordinary powers; the more,
therefore, the whole plan is manufactured by an inexperienced staff, and fr=
om
the ideas of a dozen smatterers.
</p>

<p>
We have still now to consider the third part of our first principle; that i=
s,
to keep the subordinate parts as much as possible in subordination.
</p>

<p>
Whilst we endeavour to refer the whole of the operations of a war to one si=
ngle
aim, and try to attain this as far as possible by <i>one great effort</i>, =
we
deprive the other points of contact of the States at war with each other of=
 a
part of their independence; they become subordinate actions. If we could
concentrate everything absolutely into one action, then those points of con=
tact
would be completely neutralised; but this is seldom possible, and, therefor=
e,
what we have to do is to keep them so far within bounds, that they shall no=
t
cause the abstraction of too many forces from the main action.
</p>

<p>
Next, we maintain that the plan of the war itself should have this tendency=
,
even if it is not possible to reduce the whole of the enemy=E2=80=99s resis=
tance
to one point; consequently, in case we are placed in the position already
mentioned, of carrying on two almost quite separate wars at the same time, =
the
one must always be looked upon as the <i>principal affair</i> to which our
forces and activity are to be chiefly devoted.
</p>

<p>
In this view, it is advisable only to proceed <i>offensively</i> against th=
at
one principal point, and to preserve the defensive upon all the others. The
attack there being only justifiable when invited by very exceptional
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Further we are to carry on this defensive, which takes place at minor point=
s,
with as few troops as possible, and to seek to avail ourselves of every
advantage which the defensive form can give.
</p>

<p>
This view applies with still more force to all theatres of war on which arm=
ies
come forward belonging to different powers really, but still such as will b=
e
struck when the general centre of force is struck.
</p>

<p>
But against <i>the enemy</i> at whom the great blow is aimed, there must be=
,
according to this, no defensive on minor theatres of war. The chief attack
itself, and the secondary attacks, which for other reasons are combined wit=
h
it, make up this blow, and make every defensive, on points not directly cov=
ered
by it, superfluous. All depends on this principal attack; by it every loss =
will
be compensated. If the forces are sufficient to make it reasonable to seek =
for
that great decision, then the <i>possibility of failure</i> can be no groun=
d
for guarding oneself against injury at other points in any event; for just =
by
<i>such a course</i> this failure will become more probable, and it therefo=
re
constitutes here a contradiction in our action.
</p>

<p>
This same predominance of the principal action over the minor, must be the
principle observed in each of the separate branches of the attack. But as t=
here
are generally ulterior motives which determine what forces shall advance fr=
om
one theatre of war, and what from another against the common centre of the
enemy=E2=80=99s power, we only mean here that there must be an <i>effort to=
 make
the chief action over-ruling</i>, for everything will become simpler and le=
ss
subject to the influence of chance events the nearer this state of
preponderance can be attained.
</p>

<p>
The second principle concerns the rapid use of the forces.
</p>

<p>
Every unnecessary expenditure of time, every unnecessary detour, is a waste=
 of
power, and therefore contrary to the principles of strategy.
</p>

<p>
It is most important to bear always in mind that almost the only advantage
which the offensive possesses, is the effect of surprise at the opening of =
the
scene. Suddenness and irresistible impetuosity are its strongest pinions; a=
nd
when the object is the complete overthrow of the enemy, it can rarely dispe=
nse
with them.
</p>

<p>
By this, therefore, theory demands the shortest way to the object, and
completely excludes from consideration endless discussions about right and =
left
here and there.
</p>

<p>
If we call to mind what was said in the chapter on the subject of the strat=
egic
attack respecting the pit of the stomach in a state, and further, what appe=
ars
in the fourth chapter of this book, on the influence of time, we believe no
further argument is required to prove that the influence which we claim for
that principle really belongs to it.
</p>

<p>
Buonaparte never acted otherwise. The shortest high road from army to army,
from one capital to another, was always the way he loved best.
</p>

<p>
And in what will now consist the principal action to which we have referred
everything, and for which we have demanded a swift and straightforward
execution?
</p>

<p>
In the fourth chapter we have explained as far as it is possible in a gener=
al
way what the total overthrow of the enemy means, and it is unnecessary to
repeat it. Whatever that may depend on at last in particular cases, still t=
he
first step is always the same in all cases, namely: <i>The destruction of t=
he
enemy=E2=80=99s combatant force</i>, that is, <i>a great victory over the s=
ame
and its dispersion</i>. The sooner, which means the nearer our own frontier=
s,
this victory is sought for, <i>the easier</i> it is; the later, that is, th=
e
further in the heart of the enemy=E2=80=99s country it is gained, the more
<i>decisive</i> it is. Here, as well as everywhere, the facility of success=
 and
its magnitude balance each other.
</p>

<p>
If we are not so superior to the enemy that the victory is beyond doubt, th=
en
we should, when possible, seek him out, that is his principal force. We say
<i>when possible</i>, for if this endeavour to find him led to great detour=
s,
false directions, and a loss of time, it might very likely turn out a mista=
ke.
If the enemy=E2=80=99s principal force is not on our road, and our interest=
s
otherwise prevent our going in quest of him, we may be sure we shall meet w=
ith
him hereafter, for he will not fail to place himself in our way. We shall t=
hen,
as we have just said, fight under less advantageous circumstances an evil t=
o
which we must submit. However, if we gain the battle, it will be so much th=
e
more decisive.
</p>

<p>
From this it follows that, in the case now assumed, it would be an error to
pass by the enemy=E2=80=99s principal force designedly, if it places itself=
 in
our way, at least if we expect thereby to facilitate a victory.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it follows from what precedes, that if we have a decided
superiority over the enemy=E2=80=99s principal force, we may designedly pas=
s it
by in order at a future time to deliver a more decisive battle.
</p>

<p>
We have been speaking of a complete victory, therefore of a thorough defeat=
 of
the enemy, and not of a mere battle gained. But such a victory requires an
enveloping attack, or a battle with an oblique front, for these two forms
always give the result a decisive character. It is therefore an essential p=
art
of a plan of a war to make arrangements for this movement, both as regards =
the
mass of forces required and the direction to be given them, of which more w=
ill
be said in the chapter on the plan of campaign.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly not impossible, that even Battles fought with parallel fron=
ts
may lead to complete defeats, and cases in point are not wanting in militar=
y
history; but such an event is uncommon, and will be still more so the more
armies become on a par as regards discipline and handiness in the field. We=
 no
longer take twenty-one battalions in a village, as they did at Blenheim.
</p>

<p>
Once the great victory is gained, the next question is not about rest, not
about taking breath, not about considering, not about reorganising, etc., e=
tc.,
but only of pursuit of fresh blows wherever necessary, of the capture of th=
e
enemy=E2=80=99s capital, of the attack of the armies of his allies, or of
whatever else appears to be a rallying point for the enemy.
</p>

<p>
If the tide of victory carries us near the enemy=E2=80=99s fortresses, the =
laying
siege to them or not will depend on our means. If we have a great superiori=
ty
of force, it would be a loss of time not to take them as soon as possible; =
but
if we are not certain of the further events before us, we must keep the
fortresses in check with as few troops as possible, which precludes any reg=
ular
formal sieges. The moment that the siege of a fortress compels us to suspen=
d
our strategic advance, that advance, <i>as a rule</i>, has reached its
culminating point. We demand, therefore, that the main body should press
forward rapidly in pursuit without any rest; we have already condemned the =
idea
of allowing the advance towards the principal point being made dependent on
success at secondary points; the consequence of this is, that in all ordina=
ry
cases, our chief army only keeps behind it a narrow strip of territory whic=
h it
can call its own, and which therefore constitutes its theatre of war. How t=
his
weakens the momentum at the head, and the dangers for the offensive arising
therefrom, we have shown already. Will not this difficulty, will not this
intrinsic counterpoise come to a point which impedes further advance? Certa=
inly
that may occur; but just as we have already insisted that it would be a mis=
take
to try to avoid this contracted theatre of war at the commencement, and for=
 the
sake of that object to rob the advance of its elasticity, so we also now
maintain, that as long as the commander has not yet overthrown his opponent=
, as
long as he considers himself strong enough to effect that object, so long m=
ust
he also pursue it. He does so perhaps at an increased risk, but also with t=
he
prospect of a greater success. If he reaches a point which he cannot ventur=
e to
go beyond, where, in order to protect his rear, he must extend himself righ=
t
and left well, then, this is most probably his culminating point. The power=
 of
flight is spent, and if the enemy is not subdued, most probably he will not=
 be
now.
</p>

<p>
All that the assailant now does to intensify his attack by conquest of
fortresses, defiles, provinces, is no doubt still a slow advance, but it is
only of a relative kind, it is no longer absolute. The enemy is no longer i=
n
flight, he is perhaps preparing a renewed resistance, and it is therefore
already possible that, although the assailant still advances intensively, t=
he
position of the defence is every day improving. In short, we come back to t=
his,
that, as a rule, there is no second spring after a halt has once been
necessary.
</p>

<p>
Theory, therefore, only requires that, as long as there is an intention of
destroying the enemy, there must be no cessation in the advance of the atta=
ck;
if the commander gives up this object because it is attended with too great=
 a
risk, he does right to stop and extend his force. Theory only objects to th=
is
when he does it with a view to more readily defeating the enemy.
</p>

<p>
We are not so foolish as to maintain that no instance can be found of State=
s
having been <i>gradually</i> reduced to the utmost extremity. In the first
place, the principle we now maintain is no absolute truth, to which an
exception is impossible, but one founded only on the ordinary and probable
result; next, we must make a distinction between cases in which the downfal=
l of
a State has been effected by a slow gradual process, and those in which the
event was the result of a first campaign. We are here only treating of the
latter case, for it is only in such that there is that tension of forces wh=
ich
either overcomes the centre of gravity of the weight, or is in danger of be=
ing
overcome by it. If in the first year we gain a moderate advantage, to which=
 in
the following we add another, and thus gradually advance towards our object=
,
there is nowhere very imminent danger, but it is distributed over many poin=
ts.
Each pause between one result and another gives the enemy fresh chances: th=
e
effects of the first results have very little influence on those which foll=
ow,
often none, often a negative only, because the enemy recovers himself, or i=
s
perhaps excited to increased resistance, or obtains foreign aid; whereas, w=
hen
all is done in one march, the success of yesterday brings on with itself th=
at
of to-day, one brand lights itself from another. If there are cases in whic=
h
States have been overcome by successive blows in which, consequently,
<i>Time</i>, generally the patron of the defensive, has proved adverse how
infinitely more numerous are the instances in which the designs of the
aggressor have by that means utterly failed. Let us only think of the resul=
t of
the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War, in which the Austrians sought to attain their
object so comfortably, cautiously, and prudently, that they completely miss=
ed
it.
</p>

<p>
In this view, therefore, we cannot at all join in the opinion that the care
which belongs to the preparation of a theatre of war, and the impulse which
urges us onwards, are on a level in importance, and that the former must, t=
o a
certain extent, be a counterpoise to the latter; but we look upon any evil
which springs out of the forward movement, as an unavoidable evil which onl=
y
deserves attention when there is no longer hope for us a-head by the forwar=
d
movement.
</p>

<p>
Buonaparte=E2=80=99s case in 1812, very far from shaking our opinion, has r=
ather
confirmed us in it.
</p>

<p>
His campaign did not miscarry because he advanced too swiftly, or too far, =
as
is commonly believed, but because the only means of success failed. The Rus=
sian
Empire is no country which can be regularly conquered, that is to say, whic=
h
can be held in possession, at least not by the forces of the present States=
 of
Europe, nor by the 500,000 men with which Buonaparte invaded the country. S=
uch
a country can only be subdued by its own weakness, and by the effects of
internal dissension. In order to strike these vulnerable points in its
political existence, the country must be agitated to its very centre. It wa=
s
only by reaching Moscow with the force of his blow that Buonaparte could ho=
pe
to shake the courage of the Government, the loyalty and steadfastness of th=
e
people. In Moscow he expected to find peace, and this was the only rational
object which he could set before himself in undertaking such a war.
</p>

<p>
He therefore led his main body against that of the Russians, which fell bac=
k
before him, trudged past the camp at Drissa, and did not stop until it reac=
hed
Smolensk. He carried Bagration along in his movement, beat the principal Ru=
ssia
army, and took Moscow.
</p>

<p>
He acted on this occasion as he had always done: it was only in that way th=
at
he made himself the arbiter of Europe, and only in that way was it possible=
 for
him to do so.
</p>

<p>
He, therefore, who admires Buonaparte in all his earlier campaigns as the
greatest of generals, ought not to censure him in this instance.
</p>

<p>
It is quite allowable to judge an event according to the result, as that is=
 the
best criticism upon it (see fifth chapter, 2nd book), but this judgment der=
ived
merely from the result, must not then be passed off as evidence of superior
understanding. To seek out the causes of the failure of a campaign, is not
going the length of making a criticism upon it; it is only if we show that
these causes should neither have been overlooked nor disregarded that we ma=
ke a
criticism and place ourselves above the General.
</p>

<p>
Now we maintain that any one who pronounces the campaign of 1812 an absurdi=
ty
merely on account of the tremendous reaction in it, and who, if it had been
successful, would look upon it as a most splendid combination, shows an utt=
er
incapacity of judgment.
</p>

<p>
If Buonaparte had remained in Lithuania, as most of his critics think he
should, in order first to get possession of the fortresses, of which, moreo=
ver,
except Riga, situated quite at one side, there is hardly one, because Bobru=
isk
is a small insignificant place of arms, he would have involved himself for =
the
winter in a miserable defensive system: then the same people would have bee=
n
the first to exclaim, This is not the old Buonaparte! How is it, he has not=
 got
even as far as a first great battle? he who used to put the final seal to h=
is
conquests on the last ramparts of the enemy=E2=80=99s states, by victories =
such
as Austerlitz and Friedland. Has his heart failed him that he has not taken=
 the
enemy=E2=80=99s capital, the defenceless Moscow, ready to open its gates, a=
nd
thus left a nucleus round which new elements of resistance may gather
themselves? He had the singular luck to take this far-off and enormous colo=
ssus
by surprise, as easily as one would surprise a neighbouring town, or as
Frederick the Great entered the little state of Silesia, lying at his door,=
 and
he makes no use of his good fortune, halts in the middle of his victorious
career, as if some evil spirit laid at his heels! This is the way in which =
he
would have been judged of after the result, for this is the fashion of
critics=E2=80=99 judgments in general.
</p>

<p>
In opposition to this, we say, the campaign of 1812 did not succeed because=
 the
government remained firm, the people loyal and steadfast, because it theref=
ore
could not succeed. Buonaparte may have made a mistake in undertaking such a=
n
expedition; at all events, the result has shown that he deceived himself in=
 his
calculations, but we maintain that, supposing it necessary to seek the
attainment of this object, it could not have been done in any other way upo=
n
the whole.
</p>

<p>
Instead of burthening himself with an interminable costly defensive war in =
the
east, such as he had on his hands in the west, Buonaparte attempted the onl=
y
means to gain his object: by one bold stroke to extort a peace from his
astonished adversary. The destruction of his army was the danger to which h=
e
exposed himself in the venture; it was the stake in the game, the price of
great expectations. If this destruction of his army was more complete than =
it
need have been through his own fault, this fault was not in his having
penetrated too far into the heart of the country, for that was his object, =
and
unavoidable; but in the late period at which the campaign opened, the sacri=
fice
of life occasioned by his tactics, the want of due care for the supply of h=
is
army, and for his line of retreat, and lastly, in his having too long delay=
ed
his march from Moscow.
</p>

<p>
That the Russians were able to reach the Beresina before him, intending
regularly to cut off his retreat, is no strong argument against us. For in =
the
first place, the failure of that attempt just shows how difficult it is rea=
lly
to cut off an army, as the army which was intercepted in this case under th=
e
most unfavourable circumstances that can be conceived, still managed at las=
t to
cut its way through; and although this act upon the whole contributed certa=
inly
to increase its catastrophe, still it was not essentially the cause of it.
Secondly, it was only the very peculiar nature of the country which afforde=
d
the means to carry things as far as the Russians did; for if it had not bee=
n
for the marshes of the Beresina, with its wooded impassable borders lying
across the great road, the cutting off would have been still less possible.
Thirdly, there is generally no means of guarding against such an eventualit=
y
except by making the forward movement with the front of the army of such a
width as we have already disapproved; for if we proceed on the plan of push=
ing
on in advance with the centre and covering the wings by armies detached rig=
ht
and left, then if either of these detached armies meets with a check, we mu=
st
fall back with the centre, and then very little can be gained by the attack=
.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, it cannot be said that Buonaparte neglected his wings. A superior
force remained fronting Wittgenstein, a proportionate siege-corps stood bef=
ore
Riga which at the same time was not needed there, and in the south
Schwarzenberg had 50,000 men with which he was superior to Tormasoff and al=
most
equal to Tschitschagow: in addition, there were 30,000 men under Victor,
covering the rear of the centre. Even in the month of November, therefore, =
at
the decisive moment when the Russian armies had been reinforced, and the Fr=
ench
were very much reduced, the superiority of the Russians in rear of the Mosc=
ow
army was not so very extraordinary. Wittgenstein, Tschitschagow, and Sacken=
,
made up together a force of 100,000. Schwartzenberg, Regmer, Victor, Oudino=
t,
and St. Cyr, had still 80,000 effective. The most cautious general in advan=
cing
would hardly devote a greater proportion of his force to the protection of =
his
flanks.
</p>

<p>
If out of the 600,000 men who crossed the Niemen in 1812, Buonaparte had
brought back 250,000 instead of the 50,000 who repassed it under
Schwartzenberg, Regmer, and Macdonald, which was possible, by avoiding the
mistakes with which he has been reproached, the campaign would still have b=
een
an unfortunate one, but theory would have had nothing to object to it, for =
the
loss of half an army in such a case is not at all unusual, and only appears=
 so
to us in this instance on account of the enormous scale of the whole
enterprize.
</p>

<p>
So much for the principal operation, its necessary tendency, and the
unavoidable risks. As regards the subordinate operations, there must be, ab=
ove
all things, a common aim for all; but this aim must be so situated as not t=
o
paralyse the action of any of the individual parts. If we invade France fro=
m
the upper and middle Rhine and Holland, with the intention of uniting at Pa=
ris,
neither of the armies employed to risk anything on the advance, but to keep
itself intact until the concentration is effected, that is what we call a
ruinous plan. There must be necessarily a constant comparison of the state =
of
this threefold movement causing delay, indecision, and timidity in the forw=
ard
movement of each of the armies. It is better to assign to each part its
mission, and only to place the point of union wherever these several activi=
ties
become unity of themselves.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, when a military force advances to the attack on separate theatre=
s of
war, to each army should be assigned an object against which the force of i=
ts
shock is to be directed. Here <i>the point</i> is that <i>these shocks</i>
should be given from all sides simultaneously, but not that proportional
advantages should result from all of them.
</p>

<p>
If the task assigned to one army is found too difficult because the enemy h=
as
made a disposition of his force different to that which was expected, if it
sustains a defeat, this neither should, nor must have, any influence on the
action of the others, or we should turn the probability of the general succ=
ess
against ourselves at the very outset. It is only the unsuccessful issue of =
the
majority of enterprises or of the principal one, which can and must have an
influence upon the others: for then it comes under the head of a plan which=
 has
miscarried.
</p>

<p>
This same rule applies to those armies and portions of them which have
originally acted on the defensive, and, owing to the successes gained, have
assumed the offensive, unless we prefer to attach such spare forces to the
principal offensive, a point which will chiefly depend on the geographical
situation of the theatre of war.
</p>

<p>
But under these circumstances, what becomes of the geometrical form and uni=
ty
of the whole attack, what of the flanks and rear of corps when those corps =
next
to them are beaten.
</p>

<p>
That is precisely what we wish chiefly to combat. This glueing down of a gr=
eat
offensive plan of attack on a geometrical square, is losing one=E2=80=99s w=
ay in
the regions of fallacy.
</p>

<p>
In the fifteenth chapter of the Third Book we have shown that the geometric=
al
element has less influence in strategy than in tactics; and we shall only h=
ere
repeat the deduction there obtained, that in the attack especially, the act=
ual
results at the various points throughout deserve more attention than the
geometrical figure, which may gradually be formed through the diversity of
results.
</p>

<p>
But in any case, it is quite certain, that looking to the vast spaces with
which strategy has to deal, the views and resolutions which the geometrical
situation of the parts may create, should be left to the general-in-chief;
that, therefore, no subordinate general has a right to ask what his neighbo=
ur
is doing or leaving undone, but each is to be directed peremptorily to foll=
ow
out his object. If any serious incongruity really arises from this, a remed=
y
can always be applied in time by the supreme authority. Thus, then, may be
obviated the chief evil of this separate mode of action, which is, that in =
the
place of realities, a cloud of apprehensions and suppositions mix themselve=
s up
in the progress of an operation, that every accident affects not only the p=
art
it comes immediately in contact with, but also the whole, by the communicat=
ion
of impressions, and that a wide field of action is opened for the personal
failings and personal animosities of subordinate commanders.
</p>

<p>
We think that these views will only appear paradoxical to those who have no=
t
studied military history long enough or with sufficient attention, who do n=
ot
distinguish the important from the unimportant, nor make proper allowance f=
or
the influence of human weaknesses in general.
</p>

<p>
If even in tactics there is a difficulty, which all experienced soldiers ad=
mit
there is, in succeeding in an attack in separate columns where it depends o=
n
the perfect connection of the several columns, how much more difficult, or
rather how impossible, must this be in strategy, where the separation is so
much wider. Therefore, if a constant connection of all parts was a necessar=
y
condition of success, a strategic plan of attack of that nature must be at =
once
given up. But on the one hand, it is not left to our option to discard it
completely, because circumstances, which we cannot control, may determine i=
n
favour of it; on the other hand, even in tactics, this constant close
conjunction of all parts at every moment of the execution, is not at all
necessary, and it is still less so in strategy. Therefore in strategy we sh=
ould
pay the less attention to this point, and insist the more upon a distinct p=
iece
of work being assigned to each part.
</p>

<p>
We have still to add one important observation: it relates to the proper
allotment of parts.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1793 and 1794 the principal Austrian army was in the Netherland=
s,
that of the Prussians, on the upper Rhine. The Austrians marched from Vienn=
a to
Cond=C3=A9 and Valenciennes, crossing the line of march of the Prussians fr=
om Berlin
to Landau. The Austrians had certainly to defend their Belgian provinces in
that quarter, and any conquests made in French Flanders would have been
acquisitions conveniently situated for them, but that interest was not stro=
ng
enough. After the death of Prince Kaunitz, the Minister Thugut carried a
measure for giving up the Netherlands entirely, for the better concentratio=
n of
the Austrian forces. In fact, Austria is about twice as far from Flanders a=
s
from Alsace; and at a time when military resources were very limited, and
everything had to be paid for in ready money, that was no trifling
consideration. Still, the Minister Thugut had plainly something else in vie=
w;
his object was, through the urgency of the danger to compel Holland, Englan=
d,
and Prussia, the powers interested in the defence of the Netherlands and Lo=
wer
Rhine, to make greater efforts. He certainly deceived himself in his
calculations, because nothing could be done with the Prussian cabinet at th=
at
time, but this occurrence always shows the influence of political interests=
 on
the course of a war.
</p>

<p>
Prussia had neither anything to conquer nor to defend in Alsace. In the yea=
r
1792 it had undertaken the march through Lorraine into Champagne in a sort =
of
chivalrous spirit. But as that enterprise ended in nothing, through the
unfavourable course of circumstances, it continued the war with a feeling o=
f
very little interest. If the Prussian troops had been in the Netherlands, t=
hey
would have been in direct communication with Holland, which they might look
upon almost as their own country, having conquered it in the year 1787; the=
y
would then have covered the Lower Rhine, and consequently that part of the
Prussian monarchy which lay next to the theatre of war. Prussia on account =
of
subsidies would also have had a closer alliance with England, which, under
these circumstances, would not so easily have degenerated into the crooked
policy of which the Prussian cabinet was guilty at that time.
</p>

<p>
A much better result, therefore, might have been expected if the Austrians =
had
appeared with their principal force on the Upper Rhine, the Prussians with
their whole force in the Netherlands, and the Austrians had left there only=
 a
corps of proportionate strength.
</p>

<p>
If, instead of the enterprising Bl=C3=BCcher, General Barclay had been plac=
ed at the
head of the Silesian army in 1814, and Bl=C3=BCcher and Schwartzenberg had =
been kept
with the grand army, the campaign would perhaps have turned out a complete
failure.
</p>

<p>
If the enterprising Laudon, instead of having his theatre of war at the
strongest point of the Prussian dominions, namely, in Silesia, had been in =
the
position of the German States=E2=80=99 army, perhaps the whole Seven Years=
=E2=80=99
War would have had quite a different turn. In order to examine this subject
more narrowly, we must look at the cases according to their chief distincti=
ons.
</p>

<p>
The first is, if we carry on war in conjunction with other powers, who not =
only
take part as our allies, but also have an independent interest as well.
</p>

<p>
The second is, if the army of the ally has come to our assistance.
</p>

<p>
The third is, when it is only a question with regard to the personal
characteristics of the General.
</p>

<p>
In the two first cases, the point may be raised, whether it is better to mi=
x up
the troops of the different powers completely, so that each separate army i=
s
composed of corps of different powers, as was done in the wars 1813 and 181=
4,
or to keep them separate as much as possible, so that the army of each powe=
r
may continue distinct and act independently.
</p>

<p>
Plainly, the first is the most salutary plan; but it supposes a degree of
friendly feeling and community of interests which is seldom found. When the=
re
is this close good fellowship between the troops, it is much more difficult=
 for
the cabinets to separate their interests; and as regards the prejudicial
influence of the egotistical views of commanders, it can only show itself u=
nder
these circumstances amongst the subordinate Generals, therefore, only in th=
e
province of tactics, and even there not so freely or with such impunity as =
when
there is a complete separation. In the latter case, it affects the strategy=
,
and therefore, makes decided marks. But, as already observed, for the first
case there must be a rare spirit of conciliation on the part of the
Governments. In the year 1813, the exigencies of the time impelled all
Governments in that direction; and yet we cannot sufficiently praise this i=
n
the Emperor of Russia, that although he entered the field with the stronges=
t
army, and the change of fortune was chiefly brought about by him, yet he se=
t
aside all pride about appearing at the head of a separate and an independen=
t
Russian army, and placed his troops under the Prussian and Austrian Command=
ers.
</p>

<p>
If such a fusion of armies cannot be effected, a complete separation of the=
m is
certainly better than a half-and-half state of things; the worst of all is =
when
two independent Commanders of armies of different powers find themselves on=
 the
same theatre of war, as frequently happened in the Seven Years=E2=80=99 War=
 with
the armies of Russia, Austria, and the German States. When there is a compl=
ete
separation of forces, the burdens which must be borne are also better divid=
ed,
and each suffers only from what is his own, consequently is more impelled t=
o
activity by the force of circumstances; but if they find themselves in clos=
e
connection, or quite on the same theatre of war, this is not the case, and
besides that the ill will of one paralyses also the powers of the other as
well.
</p>

<p>
In the first of the three supposed cases, there will be no difficulty in th=
e
complete separation, as the natural interest of each State generally indica=
tes
to it a separate mode of employing its force; this may not be so in the sec=
ond
case, and then, as a rule, there is nothing to be done but to place oneself
completely under the auxiliary army, if its strength is in any way
proportionate to that measure, as the Austrians did in the latter part of t=
he
campaign of 1815, and the Prussians in the campaign of 1807.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the personal qualifications of the General, everything in th=
is
passes into what is particular and individual; but we must not omit to make=
 one
general remark, which is, that we should not, as is generally done, place a=
t
the head of subordinate armies the most prudent and cautious Commanders, bu=
t
the <i>most enterprising;</i> for we repeat that in strategic operations
conducted separately, there is nothing more important than that every part
should develop its powers to the full, in that way faults committed at one =
part
may be compensated for by successes at others. This complete activity at al=
l
points, however, is only to be expected when the Commanders are spirited,
enterprising men, who are urged forwards by natural impulsiveness by their =
own
hearts, because a mere objective, coolly reasoned out, conviction of the
necessity of action seldom suffices.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, we have to remark that, if circumstances in other respects permit, =
the
troops and their commanders, as regards their destination, should be employ=
ed
in accordance with their qualities and the nature of the country that is
regular armies; good troops; numerous cavalry; old, prudent, intelligent
generals in an open country; Militia; national levies; young enterprising
commanders in wooded country, mountains and defiles; auxiliary armies in ri=
ch
provinces where they can make themselves comfortable.
</p>

<p>
What we have now said upon a plan of a war in general, and in this chapter =
upon
those in particular which are directed to the destruction of the enemy, is
intended to give special prominence to the object of the same, and next to
indicate principles which may serve as guides in the preparation of ways an=
d
means. Our desire has been in this way to give a clear perception of what i=
s to
be, and should be, done in such a war. We have tried to emphasise the neces=
sary
and general, and to leave a margin for the play of the particular and
accidental; but to exclude all that is <i>arbitrary, unfounded, trifling,
fantastical; or sophistical</i>. If we have succeeded in this object, we lo=
ok
upon our problem as solved.
</p>

<p>
Now, if any one wonders at finding nothing here about turning rivers, about
commanding mountains from their highest points, about avoiding strong
positions, and finding the keys of a country, he has not understood us, nei=
ther
does he as yet understand war in its general relations according to our vie=
ws.
</p>

<p>
In preceding books we have characterised these subjects in general, and we
there arrived at the conclusion, they are much more insignificant in their
nature than we should think from their high repute. Therefore, so much the =
less
can or ought they to play a great part, that is, so far as to influence the
whole plan of a war, when it is a war which has for its object the destruct=
ion
of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the book we shall devote a chapter specially to the considera=
tion
of the chief command; the present chapter we shall close with an example.
</p>

<p>
If Austria, Prussia, the German Con-federation, the Netherlands and England=
,
determine on a war with France, but Russia remains neutral a case which has
frequently happened during the last one hundred and fifty years they are ab=
le
to carry on an offensive war, having for its object the overthrow of the en=
emy.
For powerful and great as France is, it is still possible for it to see mor=
e
than half its territory overrun by the enemy, its capital occupied, and its=
elf
reduced in its means to a state of complete inefficiency, without there bei=
ng
any power, except Russia, which can give it effectual support. Spain is too
distant and too disadvantageously situated; the Italian States are at prese=
nt
too brittle and powerless.
</p>

<p>
The countries we have named have, exclusive of their possessions out of Eur=
ope,
above 75,000,000 inhabitants,(*) whilst France has only 30,000,000; and the=
 army
which they could call out for a war against France really meant in earnest,
would be as follows, without exaggeration:=E2=80=94
</p>

<pre xml:space=3D"preserve">      Austria .............250,000
      Prussia .............200,000
      The rest of Germany. 150,000
      Netherlands ..........75,000
      England ..............50,000
                            =E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94
              Total: ......725,000
</pre>

<p class=3D"footnote">
(*) This chapter was probably written in 1828, since which time the numeric=
al
relations have considerably changed. A. d. H.
</p>

<p>
Should this force be placed on a warfooting it would, in all probability, v=
ery
much exceed that which France could oppose; for under Buonaparte the countr=
y
never had an army of the like strength. Now, if we take into account the
deductions required as garrisons for fortresses and dep=C3=B4ts, to watch t=
he
coasts, etc., there can be no doubt the allies would have a great superiori=
ty
in the principal theatre of war, and upon that the object or plan of
overthrowing the enemy is chiefly founded.
</p>

<p>
The centre of gravity of the French power lies in its military force and in
Paris. To defeat the former in one or more battles, to take Paris and drive=
 the
wreck of the French across the Loire, must be the object of the allies. The=
 pit
of the stomach of the French monarchy is between Paris and Brussels, on tha=
t
side the frontier is only thirty miles from the capital. Part of the allies=
;
the English, Netherlanders, Prussian, and North German States have their
natural point of assembly in that direction, as these States lie partly in =
the
immediate vicinity, partly in a direct line behind it. Austria and South
Germany can only carry on their war conveniently from the upper Rhine. Thei=
r
natural direction is upon Troyes and Paris, or it may be Orleans. Both shoc=
ks,
therefore, that from the Netherlands and the other from the upper Rhine, ar=
e
quite direct and natural, short and powerful; and both fall upon the centre=
 of
gravity of the enemy=E2=80=99s power. Between these two points, therefore, =
the
whole invading army should be divided.
</p>

<p>
But there are two considerations which interfere with the simplicity of thi=
s
plan.
</p>

<p>
The Austrians would not lay bare their Italian dominions, they would wish t=
o
retain the mastery over events there, in any case, and therefore would not
incur the risk of making an attack on the heart of France, by which they wo=
uld
leave Italy only indirectly covered. Looking to the political state of the
country, this collateral consideration is not to be treated with contempt; =
but
it would be a decided mistake if the old and oft-tried plan of an attack fr=
om
Italy, directed against the South of France, was bound up with it, and if o=
n
that account the force in Italy was increased to a size not required for me=
re
security against contingencies in the first campaign. Only the number neede=
d
for that security should remain in Italy, only that number should be withdr=
awn
from the great undertaking, if we would not be unfaithful to that first max=
im,
<i>Unity of plan, concentration of force</i>. To think of conquering France=
 by
the Rhone, would be like trying to lift a musket by the point of its bayone=
t;
but also as an auxiliary enterprise, an attack on the South of France is to=
 be
condemned, for it only raises new forces against us. Whenever an attack is =
made
on distant provinces, interests and activities are roused, which would
otherwise have lain dormant. It would only be in case that the forces left =
for
the security of Italy were in excess of the number required, and, therefore=
, to
avoid leaving them unemployed, that there would be any justification for an
attack on the South of France from that quarter.
</p>

<p>
We therefore repeat that the force left in Italy must be kept down as low a=
s
circumstances will permit; and it will be quite large enough if it will suf=
fice
to prevent the Austrians from losing the whole country in one campaign. Let=
 us
suppose that number to be 50,000 men for the purpose of our illustration.
</p>

<p>
Another consideration deserving attention, is the relation of France in res=
pect
to its sea-coast. As England has the upper hand at sea, it follows that Fra=
nce
must, on that account, be very susceptible with regard to the whole of her
Atlantic coast; and, consequently, must protect it with garrisons of greate=
r or
less strength. Now, however weak this coast-defence may be, still the Frenc=
h
frontiers are tripled by it; and large drafts, on that account, cannot fail=
 to
be withdrawn from the French army on the theatre of war. Twenty or thirty
thousand troops disposable to effect a landing, with which the English thre=
aten
France, would probably absorb twice or three times the number of French tro=
ops;
and, further, we must think not only of troops, but also of money, artiller=
y,
etc., etc., required for ships and coast batteries. Let us suppose that the
English devote 25,000 to this object.
</p>

<p>
Our plan of war would then consist simply in this:
</p>

<pre xml:space=3D"preserve">   1. That in the Netherlands:=E2=80=94
         200,000 Prussians,
          75,000 Netherlanders,
          25,000 English,
          50,000 North German Confederation,
          =E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94=E2=80=94
  Total: 350,000 be assembled,
</pre>

<p>
of whom about 50,000 should be set aside to garrison frontier fortresses, a=
nd
the remaining 300,000 should advance against Paris, and engage the French A=
rmy
in a decisive battle.
</p>

<p>
2. That 200,000 Austrians and 100,000 South German troops should assemble o=
n
the Upper Rhine to advance at the same time as the army of the Netherlands,
their direction being towards the Upper Seine, and from thence towards the
Loire, with a view, likewise, to a great battle. These two attacks would,
perhaps, unite in one on the Loire.
</p>

<p>
By this the chief point is determined. What we have to add is chiefly inten=
ded
to root out false conceptions, and is as follows:=E2=80=94
</p>

<p>
1. To seek for the great battle, as prescribed, and deliver it with such a
relation, in point of numerical strength and under such circumstances, as
promise a decisive victory, is the course for the chief commanders to follo=
w;
to this object everything must be sacrificed; and as few men as possible sh=
ould
be employed in sieges, blockades, garrisons, etc. If, like Schwartzenberg i=
n
1814, as soon as they enter the enemy=E2=80=99s provinces they spread out i=
n
eccentric rays all is lost. That this did not take place in 1814 the Allies=
 may
thank the powerless state of France alone. The attack should be like a wedg=
e
well driven home, not like a soap bubble, which distends itself till it bur=
sts.
</p>

<p>
2. Switzerland must be left to its own forces. If it remains neutral it for=
ms a
good <i>point d=E2=80=99appui</i> on the Upper Rhine; if it is attacked by
France, let her stand up for herself, which in more than one respect she is
very well able to do. Nothing is more absurd than to attribute to Switzerla=
nd a
predominant geographical influence upon events in war because it is the hig=
hest
land in Europe. Such an influence only exists under certain very restricted
conditions, which are not to be found here. When the French are attacked in=
 the
heart of their country they can undertake no offensive from Switzerland, ei=
ther
against Italy or Swabia, and, least of all, can the elevated situation of t=
he
country come into consideration as a decisive circumstance. The advantage o=
f a
country which is dominating in a strategic sense, is, in the first place,
chiefly important in the defensive, and any importance which it has in the
offensive may manifest itself in a single encounter. Whoever does not know =
this
has not thought over the thing and arrived at a clear perception of it, and=
 in
case that at any future council of potentates and generals, some learned
officer of the general staff should be found, who, with an anxious brow,
displays such wisdom, we now declare it beforehand to be mere folly, and wi=
sh
that in the same council some true Blade, some child of sound common-sense =
may
be present who will stop his mouth.
</p>

<p>
3. The space between two attacks we think of very little consequence. When
600,000 assemble thirty or forty miles from Paris to march against the hear=
t of
France, would any one think of covering the middle Rhine as well as Berlin,
Dresden, Vienna, and Munich? There would be no sense in such a thing. Are w=
e to
cover the communications? That would not be unimportant; but then we might =
soon
be led into giving this covering the importance of an attack, and then, ins=
tead
of advancing on two lines, as the situation of the States positively requir=
es,
we should be led to advance upon three, which is not required. These three
would then, perhaps, become five, or perhaps seven, and in that way the old
rigmarole would once more become the order of the day.
</p>

<p>
Our two attacks have each their object; the forces employed on them are
probably very superior to the enemy in numbers. If each pursues his march w=
ith
vigour, they cannot fail to react advantageously upon each other. If one of=
 the
two attacks is unfortunate because the enemy has not divided his force equa=
lly,
we may fairly expect that the result of the other will of itself repair thi=
s
disaster, and this is the true interdependence between the two. An
interdependence extending to (so as to be affected by) the events of each d=
ay
is impossible on account of the distance; neither is it necessary, and
therefore the immediate, or, rather the direct connection, is of no such gr=
eat
value.
</p>

<p>
Besides, the enemy attacked in the very centre of his dominions will have n=
o
forces worth speaking of to employ in interrupting this connection; all tha=
t is
to be apprehended is that this interruption may be attempted by a co-operat=
ion
of the inhabitants with the partisans, so that this object does not actuall=
y
cost the enemy any troops. To prevent that, it is sufficient to send a corp=
s of
10,000 or 15,000 men, particularly strong in cavalry, in the direction from
Tr=C3=A8ves to Rheims. It will be able to drive every partisan before it, a=
nd keep
in line with the grand army. This corps should neither invest nor watch
fortresses, but march between them, depend on no fixed basis, but give way
before superior forces in any direction, no great misfortune could happen t=
o
it, and if such did happen, it would again be no serious misfortune for the
whole. Under these circumstances, such a corps might probably serve as an
intermediate link between the two attacks.
</p>

<p>
4. The two subordinate undertakings, that is, the Austrian army in Italy, a=
nd
the English army for landing on the coast, might follow their object as
appeared best. If they do not remain idle, their mission is fulfilled as
regards the chief point, and on no account should either of the two great
attacks be made dependent in any way on these minor ones.
</p>

<p>
We are quite convinced that in this way France may be overthrown and chasti=
sed
whenever it thinks fit to put on that insolent air with which it has oppres=
sed
Europe for a hundred and fifty years. It is only on the other side of Paris=
, on
the Loire, that those conditions can be obtained from it which are necessar=
y
for the peace of Europe. In this way alone the natural relation between 30
millions of men and 75 millions will quickly make itself known, but not if =
the
country from Dunkirk to Genoa is to be surrounded in the way it has been fo=
r
150 years by a girdle of armies, whilst fifty different small objects are a=
imed
at, not one of which is powerful enough to overcome the inertia, friction, =
and
extraneous influences which spring up and reproduce themselves everywhere, =
but
more especially in allied armies.
</p>

<p>
How little the provisional organisation of the German federal armies is ada=
pted
to such a disposition, will strike the reader. By that organisation the
federative part of Germany forms the nucleus of the German power, and Pruss=
ia
and Austria thus weakened, lose their natural influence. But a federative s=
tate
is a very brittle nucleus in war. There is in it no unity, no energy, no
rational choice of a commander, no authority, no responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Austria and Prussia are the two natural centres of force of the German empi=
re;
they form the pivot (or fulcrum), the forte of the sword; they are monarchi=
cal
states, used to war; they have well-defined interests, independence of powe=
r;
they are predominant over the others. The organisation should follow these
natural lineaments, and not a false notion about unity, which is an
impossibility in such a case; and he who neglects the possible in quest of =
the
impossible is a fool.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundat=
ion

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
